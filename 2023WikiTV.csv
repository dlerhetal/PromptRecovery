2023_tv_82,"Hawaiian Telcom removes the Honolulu duopoly of Fox/CW affiliate KHON and MyNetworkTV affiliate KHII, and NewsNation from its systems across the state after failing to renew an agreement with Nexstar Media Group that expired on June 30. The provider filed an FCC complaint on July 6, asking for the commission to rule Nexstar's failure to continue the channels’ carriage as a violation of good-faith negotiation rules for each day since the previous contract lapsed. Hawaiian Telcom, which noted the Islands‘ volcanic and mountainous terrain prevents many residents from receiving KHON/KHII over-the-air and alleged that the group sought to increase fees to carry the channels by 80%, accused Nexstar of withholding consent by not responding to its request to extend negotiations by one week—forcing it to remove the channels—until immediately before the agreement expired. The parties reached a multi-year agreement to restore KHON/KHII (along with Rewind TV-affiliated KHON-DT4) and NewsNation to Hawaiian Telcom's lineup on July 20, although the provider stated it would not drop the Nexstar complaint (which it amended the day before to allege the group had unraveled an earlier version of the deal on July 17, demanding Hawaiian Telcom rescind the complaint and not file future FCC complaints against Nexstar).",296
2023_tv_87,"SAG-AFTRA commenced a strike against television and film studios, after the union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers failed to agree on a new contract after their previous agreement expired on June 30. This marks the first time that actors have initiated a labor dispute since the 1980 actors strike. With the concurrent Writers Guild of America strike, this was also the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960. Similar to the WGA, SAG-AFTRA cited several issues, including economic fairness, residuals, regulating the use of artificial intelligence, and alleviating the burdens of the industry-wide shift to self-taping. In addition to impacting film and television productions, actors could not take part in promotional work, such as press junkets, film premieres, and other events such as the San Diego Comic-Con. Journalists and performers employed under the SAG-AFTRA National Code of Fair Practice for Network Television Broadcasting contract (a separate agreement negotiated between the union, major broadcast networks and other producers which currently runs through July 2024) were not affected, allowing news programs, most talk, variety, game and reality shows, soap operas, sports and promos to continue production with SAG-AFTRA members covered by that agreement. The strike ended on November 9 after a new agreement with the AMPTP was reached.",288

Eight candidates appear on the stage—Doug Burgum, Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Asa Hutchinson, Mike Pence, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Tim Scott—the lowest number of candidates for the first Republican debate stage since 2012. The relatively low number was due to strict RNC requirements that any participants have at least 40,000 individual donors and poll above 1% in either three national polls or two national polls and one state poll. (By comparison, high candidate numbers caused both the 2016 GOP and 2020 Democratic debates to be spread out over two nights.) Thanks to not meeting polling requirements or refusing to sign a loyalty pledge to back the eventual nominee, Ryan Binkley, Larry Elder, Will Hurd, Perry Johnson, Francis Suarez, and former president Donald Trump did not attend; Trump, the polling frontrunner, instead appears in a pre-taped interview with Tucker Carlson that aired as counterprogramming to the debate on X (formerly Twitter).",284

Although Stitt later alleged the veto was over objections to LGBTQ+ content on certain PBS programs that he claims ""indoctrinat[es]"" and ""overly sexualizes"" children (harkening rhetoric of a broader ongoing culture war over LGBTQ+ rights), the bill is one of over 20 measures (some passed unanimously by the state's House and Senate) that he elected to veto in a broader impasse with Senate leaders over his education and tax proposals—which, in addition to increasing education funding and teacher salaries, would also create a voucher-like tax credit program. The veto of H.B. 2820—which, had it not received the required two-thirds support of both legislative chambers to override it, would have resulted in OETA's agency authorization expiring on July 1 and the member network ceasing operations when its existing funding appropriations lapsed in July 2024—was overridden by the legislature on May 25 (the penultimate day of its 2023 session), passing the House, 73–23, and the Senate, 38–6.",273

The impasse results in the complete loss of stations operated by Nexstar and its partner companies (Mission Broadcasting and White Knight Broadcasting) from the DirecTV satellite service, DirecTV Stream and U-verse, amid an existing contractual and legal dispute between DirecTV and Nexstar dating to October 2022, concerning alleged collective bargaining influence by the three station groups in retransmission fee negotiations that prompted the earlier removal of Mission and White Knight's respective stations from the company's television services (see March 14 entry). In a July 18 FCC letter, DirecTV accused CW majority owner Nexstar of forcing Sinclair Broadcast Group to remove 21 affiliates (all based in markets where both groups operate stations, and leaving subscribers of the vMVPD service in those areas unable to view CW programs) from DirecTV Stream on July 12; Nexstar countered that DirecTV Stream continued to carry Sinclair's CW stations without renewing a prior agreement that expired in November 2022.

Although WLBT—which infamously had its license revoked by the FCC in 1969 from original owner Lamar Life Insurance, due to the station's advocacy of racial segregation and omission of civil rights movement coverage during NBC News broadcasts—has not formally disclosed Bassett's status, her biography was removed from its website.

Because Gray already owned NBC affiliate KTUU, the FCC considered the transaction as equivalent to purchasing a second top-four station in violation of FCC duopoly regulations. Gray—which acquired KAUU (then a lower-rated MyNetworkTV affiliate) in 2016—contends the FCC had no authority to regulate the affiliation purchase as it did not involve a license transfer, that its regulation of a ""functional equivalent"" to the agency's Top-4 Rule via the fine exceeds the agency's regulatory authority, and that the fine violates the First Amendment by penalizing Gray's programming decisions without furthering a ""legitimate"" government interest.",257

The deal is the golf organization's first U.S. broadcast deal—its inaugural year in 2022 was available only through YouTube—and the CW's entry into live sports telecasts. This deal was criticized by the National Press Club as an attempt by Saudi Arabia's monarchy (which finances LIV through a sovereign wealth fund) to sportwash its unflattering reputation after their alleged involvement in the October 2018 assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As CW stations are only contractually obligated to air the network's prime time schedule, 14 affiliates (eight owned by CBS, five owned by Tegna, and Weigel-owned WCIU/Chicago) declined to air the LIV telecasts; CW majority owner Nexstar leased airtime on other stations in those markets.",256

The suit alleged that Nexstar did not give DirecTV adequate notice that the station would become an independent once its affiliation contract with NBC expired in July 2016, resulting in the satellite provider overpaying to carry a station that would no longer be a Big Four affiliate. (As part of an effort at the time to reduce affiliate duplication in certain markets, NBC parent Comcast elected to disaffiliate from WHAG—a decision that was disclosed publicly by Nexstar in February 2016—due to perceived competition with nearby O&O WRC/Washington, D.C.) The court ruled that Nexstar overcharged DirecTV by basing its carriage fee rate for WDVM on its prior NBC affiliation, and ordered the broadcaster to repay “several million dollars” worth of excess fees that DirecTV paid during the contract term (plus interest).",242

The two companies would announce a new agreement on September 11, one that allows customers who subscribe to certain Spectrum packages access to the Disney+ and ESPN+ streaming services (and, when it launches, ESPN's direct-to-consumer service), but also allows Charter to drop carriage of Freeform, FXX, FXM, and smaller Disney- and Nat Geo-branded channels.",153

(Authorities later confirmed that they only found an iPhone charger and wiring in the backpack.) The suspect—who initially said he was submitting a news tip—forced his way through the front door of the Sinclair-owned CBS/CW affiliate's lobby when chief engineer George Markle moved to barricade the suspect between both lobby doors, and helped evacuate station staff from the building. After two hours, the suspect surrendered to police and was taken to the Kalamazoo County Jail.",152

The rescheduling, due to the ongoing Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes, mark the first postponement of a Primetime Emmy ceremony since 2001, when the September 11 attacks and ensuing start of the war in Afghanistan pushed the 53rd Primetime Emmys from September to November.

The ceremony airs live on Netflix's YouTube channel, a one-year arrangement between SAG and Netflix before the streamer, once its live-streaming capabilities are worked out, carries the ceremony exclusively beginning in 2024.

Originally planned as a live ceremony (from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California), the event airs instead as a prerecorded presentation in the wake of several attendees, and previously announced emcee Drew Barrymore, withdrawing in solidarity with striking WGA members, as well as plans by the Guild to picket the event. (Barrymore, who still appeared on the broadcast in pre-recorded skits, has agreed to host the ceremony in 2024.)",151
