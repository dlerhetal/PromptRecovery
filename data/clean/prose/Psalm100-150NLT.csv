O Lord my God, how great you are!
    You are robed with honor and majesty.",30
10402,"     You are dressed in a robe of light.
You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens;",21
10403,"     you lay out the rafters of your home in the rain clouds.
You make the clouds your chariot;

    flames of fire are your servants.",15
10405," You placed the world on its foundation
    so it would never be moved.",16
10406," You clothed the earth with floods of water,
    water that covered even the mountains.",18

    at the sound of your thunder, it hurried away.",20
10408," Mountains rose and valleys sank
    to the levels you decreed.",14
10409," Then you set a firm boundary for the seas,
    so they would never again cover the earth.",20
10410," You make springs pour water into the ravines,
    so streams gush down from the mountains.",20
10411," They provide water for all the animals,
    and the wild donkeys quench their thirst.",19
10412," The birds nest beside the streams
    and sing among the branches of the trees.",17
10413," You send rain on the mountains from your heavenly home,
    and you fill the earth with the fruit of your labor.",24
10414," You cause grass to grow for the livestock
    and plants for people to use.
You allow them to produce food from the earth",26
10415,"     wine to make them glad,
olive oil to soothe their skin,
    and bread to give them strength.",24
10416," The trees of the Lord are well cared for
    the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.",21
10417," There the birds make their nests,
    and the storks make their homes in the cypresses.",21
10418," High in the mountains live the wild goats,
    and the rocks form a refuge for the hyraxes.",22

    and the sun knows when to set.",18
10420," You send the darkness, and it becomes night,
    when all the forest animals prowl about.",20
10421," Then the young lions roar for their prey,
    stalking the food provided by God.",17
10422," At dawn they slink back
    into their dens to rest.",14
10423," Then people go off to their work,
    where they labor until evening.",15
10424," O Lord, what a variety of things you have made!
    In wisdom you have made them all.
    The earth is full of your creatures.",30
10425," Here is the ocean, vast and wide,
    teeming with life of every kind,
    both large and small.",24
10426," See the ships sailing along,
    and Leviathan, which you made to play in the sea.",20
10427," They all depend on you
    to give them food as they need it.",16
10428," When you supply it, they gather it.
    You open your hand to feed them,
    and they are richly satisfied.",26
10429," But if you turn away from them, they panic.
    When you take away their breath,
    they die and turn again to dust.",28
10430," When you give them your breath, life is created,
    and you renew the face of the earth.",21
10431," May the glory of the Lord continue forever!
    The Lord takes pleasure in all he has made!",20
10432," The earth trembles at his glance;
    the mountains smoke at his touch.",16
10433," I will sing to the Lord as long as I live.
    I will praise my God to my last breath!",23
10434," May all my thoughts be pleasing to him,
    for I rejoice in the Lord.",17
10435," Let all sinners vanish from the face of the earth;
    let the wicked disappear forever.
Let all that I am praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord!",33
10501," Give thanks to the Lord and proclaim his greatness.
    Let the whole world know what he has done.",21

    Tell everyone about his wonderful deeds.",18
10503," Exult in his holy name;
    rejoice, you who worship the Lord.",16
10504," Search for the Lord and for his strength;
    continually seek him.",14
10505," Remember the wonders he has performed,
    his miracles, and the rulings he has given,",18
10506," you children of his servant Abraham,
    you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.",17
10507," He is the Lord our God.
    His justice is seen throughout the land.",16
10508," He always stands by his covenant
    the commitment he made to a thousand generations.",17
10509," This is the covenant he made with Abraham
    and the oath he swore to Isaac.",18
10510," He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
    and to the people of Israel as a neverending covenant:",22
10511," I will give you the land of Canaan
    as your special possession.",16
10512," He said this when they were few in number,
    a tiny group of strangers in Canaan.",20
10513," They wandered from nation to nation,
    from one kingdom to another.",14
10514," Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.
    He warned kings on their behalf:",17
10515," Do not touch my chosen people,
    and do not hurt my prophets.",15
10516," He called for a famine on the land of Canaan,
    cutting off its food supply.",19
10517," Then he sent someone to Egypt ahead of them
    Joseph, who was sold as a slave.",20
10518," They bruised his feet with fetters
    and placed his neck in an iron collar.",19
10519," Until the time came to fulfill his dreams,
    the Lord tested Josephs character.",17
10520," Then Pharaoh sent for him and set him free;
    the ruler of the nation opened his prison door.",22
10521," Joseph was put in charge of all the kings household;
    he became ruler over all the kings possessions.",21
10522," He could instruct the kings aides as he pleased
    and teach the kings advisers.",17
10523," Then Israel arrived in Egypt;
    Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.",19
10524," And the Lord multiplied the people of Israel
    until they became too mighty for their enemies.",19
10525," Then he turned the Egyptians against the Israelites,
    and they plotted against the Lords servants.",19
10526," But the Lord sent his servant Moses,
    along with Aaron, whom he had chosen.",18
10527," They performed miraculous signs among the Egyptians,
    and wonders in the land of Ham.",17
10528," The Lord blanketed Egypt in darkness,
    for they had defied his commands to let his people go.",22
10529," He turned their water into blood,
    poisoning all the fish.",13
10530," Then frogs overran the land
    and even invaded the kings bedrooms.",15
10531," When the Lord spoke, flies descended on the Egyptians,
    and gnats swarmed across Egypt.",20
10532," He sent them hail instead of rain,
    and lightning flashed over the land.",16
10533," He ruined their grapevines and fig trees
    and shattered all the trees.",17
10534," He spoke, and hordes of locusts came
    young locusts beyond number.",20
10535," They ate up everything green in the land,
    destroying all the crops in their fields.",18
10536," Then he killed the oldest son in each Egyptian home,
    the pride and joy of each family.",20
10537," The Lord brought his people out of Egypt, loaded with silver and gold;
    and not one among the tribes of Israel even stumbled.",27
10538," Egypt was glad when they were gone,
    for they feared them greatly.",15
10539," The Lord spread a cloud above them as a covering
    and gave them a great fire to light the darkness.",23
10540," They asked for meat, and he sent them quail;
    he satisfied their hunger with mannabread from heaven.",24
10541," He split open a rock, and water gushed out
    to form a river through the dry wasteland.",23
10542," For he remembered his sacred promise
    to his servant Abraham.",13
10543," So he brought his people out of Egypt with joy,
    his chosen ones with rejoicing.",19
10544," He gave his people the lands of pagan nations,
    and they harvested crops that others had planted.",20
10545," All this happened so they would follow his decrees
    and obey his instructions.
Praise the Lord!",22
10601," Praise the Lord!
Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!
    His faithful love endures forever.",24
10602," Who can list the glorious miracles of the Lord?
    Who can ever praise him enough?",18
10603," There is joy for those who deal justly with others
    and always do what is right.",20
10604," Remember me, Lord, when you show favor to your people;
    come near and rescue me.",20
10605," Let me share in the prosperity of your chosen ones.
    Let me rejoice in the joy of your people;
    let me praise you with those who are your heritage.",34
10606," Like our ancestors, we have sinned.
    We have done wrong! We have acted wickedly!",21
10607," Our ancestors in Egypt
    were not impressed by the Lords miraculous deeds.
They soon forgot his many acts of kindness to them.
    Instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea.",39
10608," Even so, he saved them
    to defend the honor of his name
    and to demonstrate his mighty power.",24
10609," He commanded the Red Sea to dry up.
    He led Israel across the sea as if it were a desert.",23
10610," So he rescued them from their enemies
    and redeemed them from their foes.",16
10611," Then the water returned and covered their enemies;
    not one of them survived.",16
10612," Then his people believed his promises.
    Then they sang his praise.",14
10613," Yet how quickly they forgot what he had done!
    They wouldnt wait for his counsel!",19
10614," In the wilderness their desires ran wild,
    testing Gods patience in that dry wasteland.",18
10615," So he gave them what they asked for,
    but he sent a plague along with it.",19
10616," The people in the camp were jealous of Moses
    and envious of Aaron, the Lords holy priest.",22
10617," Because of this, the earth opened up;
    it swallowed Dathan
    and buried Abiram and the other rebels.",25
10618," Fire fell upon their followers;
    a flame consumed the wicked.",13
10619," The people made a calf at Mount Sinai;
    they bowed before an image made of gold.",19
10620," They traded their glorious God
    for a statue of a grasseating bull.",17
10621," They forgot God, their savior,
    who had done such great things in Egypt",17
10622," such wonderful things in the land of Ham,
    such awesome deeds at the Red Sea.",18
10623," So he declared he would destroy them.
    But Moses, his chosen one, stepped between the Lord and the people.
    He begged him to turn from his anger and not destroy them.",38
10624," The people refused to enter the pleasant land,
    for they wouldnt believe his promise to care for them.",22
10625," Instead, they grumbled in their tents
    and refused to obey the Lord.",17
10626," Therefore, he solemnly swore
    that he would kill them in the wilderness,",17
10627," that he would scatter their descendants among the nations,
    exiling them to distant lands.",18
10628," Then our ancestors joined in the worship of Baal at Peor;
    they even ate sacrifices offered to the dead!",24
10629," They angered the Lord with all these things,
    so a plague broke out among them.",18
10630," But Phinehas had the courage to intervene,
    and the plague was stopped.",17
10631," So he has been regarded as a righteous man
    ever since that time.",16
10632," At Meribah, too, they angered the Lord,
    causing Moses serious trouble.",18
10633," They made Moses angry,
    and he spoke foolishly.",12
10634," Israel failed to destroy the nations in the land,
    as the Lord had commanded them.",18
10635," Instead, they mingled among the pagans
    and adopted their evil customs.",17
10636," They worshiped their idols,
    which led to their downfall.",13
10637," They even sacrificed their sons
    and their daughters to the demons.",14
10638," They shed innocent blood,
    the blood of their sons and daughters.
By sacrificing them to the idols of Canaan,
    they polluted the land with murder.",32
10639," They defiled themselves by their evil deeds,
    and their love of idols was adultery in the Lords sight.",22
10640," That is why the Lords anger burned against his people,
    and he abhorred his own special possession.",22
10641," He handed them over to pagan nations,
    and they were ruled by those who hated them.",19
10642," Their enemies crushed them
    and brought them under their cruel power.",14
10643," Again and again he rescued them,
    but they chose to rebel against him,
    and they were finally destroyed by their sin.",26
10644," Even so, he pitied them in their distress
    and listened to their cries.",18
10645," He remembered his covenant with them
    and relented because of his unfailing love.",18
10646," He even caused their captors
    to treat them with kindness.",14
10647," Save us, O Lord our God!
    Gather us back from among the nations,
so we can thank your holy name
    and rejoice and praise you.",32
10648," Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,
    who lives from everlasting to everlasting!
Let all the people say, Amen!
Praise the Lord!",31
10701," Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!
    His faithful love endures forever.",19
10702," Has the Lord redeemed you? Then speak out!
    Tell others he has redeemed you from your enemies.",21
10703," For he has gathered the exiles from many lands,
    from east and west,
    from north and south.",23
10704," Some wandered in the wilderness,
    lost and homeless.",11
10705," Hungry and thirsty,
    they nearly died.",10
10706," Lord, help! they cried in their trouble,
    and he rescued them from their distress.",19
10707," He led them straight to safety,
    to a city where they could live.",16
10708," Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them.",22
10709," For he satisfies the thirsty
    and fills the hungry with good things.",15
10710," Some sat in darkness and deepest gloom,
    imprisoned in iron chains of misery.",17
10711," They rebelled against the words of God,
    scorning the counsel of the Most High.",19
10712," That is why he broke them with hard labor;
    they fell, and no one was there to help them.",23
10713," Lord, help! they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress.",19
10714," He led them from the darkness and deepest gloom;
    he snapped their chains.",17
10715," Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them.",22
10716," For he broke down their prison gates of bronze;
    he cut apart their bars of iron.",19
10717," Some were fools; they rebelled
    and suffered for their sins.",15
10718," They couldnt stand the thought of food,
    and they were knocking on deaths door.",18
10719," Lord, help! they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress.",19
10720," He sent out his word and healed them,
    snatching them from the door of death.",19
10721," Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them.",22
10722," Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
    and sing joyfully about his glorious acts.",18
10723," Some went off to sea in ships,
    plying the trade routes of the world.",18
10724," They, too, observed the Lords power in action,
    his impressive works on the deepest seas.",20
10725," He spoke, and the winds rose,
    stirring up the waves.",14
10726," Their ships were tossed to the heavens
    and plunged again to the depths;
    the sailors cringed in terror.",24
10727," They reeled and staggered like drunkards
    and were at their wits end.",19
10728," Lord, help! they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress.",19
10729," He calmed the storm to a whisper
    and stilled the waves.",16
10730," What a blessing was that stillness
    as he brought them safely into harbor!",17
10731," Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them.",22
10732," Let them exalt him publicly before the congregation
    and before the leaders of the nation.",19
10733," He changes rivers into deserts,
    and springs of water into dry, thirsty land.",18
10734," He turns the fruitful land into salty wastelands,
    because of the wickedness of those who live there.",23
10735," But he also turns deserts into pools of water,
    the dry land into springs of water.",20
10736," He brings the hungry to settle there
    and to build their cities.",15
10737," They sow their fields, plant their vineyards,
    and harvest their bumper crops.",17
10738," How he blesses them!
    They raise large families there,
    and their herds of livestock increase.",22
10739," When they decrease in number and become impoverished
    through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,",18
10740," the Lord pours contempt on their princes,
    causing them to wander in trackless wastelands.",20
10741," But he rescues the poor from trouble
    and increases their families like flocks of sheep.",20
10742," The godly will see these things and be glad,
    while the wicked are struck silent.",19
10743," Those who are wise will take all this to heart;
    they will see in our history the faithful love of the Lord.",25
10801," My heart is confident in you, O God;

    turning yellow when only half grown,",19

    despised by the binder.",13

    refuse to give them this blessing:
The Lord bless you;
    we bless you in the Lords name.",29

    I call for your help.",16
13002," Hear my cry, O Lord.
    Pay attention to my prayer.",14
13003," Lord, if you kept a record of our sins,
    who, O Lord, could ever survive?",21
13004," But you offer forgiveness,
    that we might learn to fear you.",14
13005," I am counting on the Lord;
    yes, I am counting on him.
    I have put my hope in his word.",26
13006," I long for the Lord
    more than sentries long for the dawn,
    yes, more than sentries long for the dawn.",28
13007," O Israel, hope in the Lord;
    for with the Lord there is unfailing love.
    His redemption overflows.",25
13008," He himself will redeem Israel
    from every kind of sin.",13
13101," Lord, my heart is not proud;
    my eyes are not haughty.
I dont concern myself with matters too great
    or too awesome for me to grasp.",34
13102," Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself,
    like a weaned child who no longer cries for its mothers milk.
    Yes, like a weaned child is my soul within me.",40
13103," O Israel, put your hope in the Lord
    now and always.",15

    I will not let myself rest.",14
13204," I will not let my eyes sleep
    nor close my eyelids in slumber",17

    a sanctuary for the Mighty One of Israel.",23
13206," We heard that the Ark was in Ephrathah;
    then we found it in the distant countryside of Jaar.",25
13207," Let us go to the sanctuary of the Lord;
    let us worship at the footstool of his throne.",23
13208," Arise, O Lord, and enter your resting place,
    along with the Ark, the symbol of your power.",24
13209," May your priests be clothed in godliness;
    may your loyal servants sing for joy.",19
13210," For the sake of your servant David,
    do not reject the king you have anointed.",19
13211," The Lord swore an oath to David
