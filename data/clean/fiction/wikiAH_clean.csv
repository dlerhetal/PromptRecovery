Albert fears that Virginia is going to be harmed or killed by her jealous husband Joseph due to her affair with her ex, and indeed Virginia is knocked out by a falling scaffolding plank that night while strolling with Albert. Joseph says it must have been an accident caused by the wind, but Albert realizes that there was no wind that night. A container of arsenic also mysteriously disappeared, with Joseph falling ill with symptoms of arsenic poisoning (which Albert believes was accidental in Joseph's planning to kill Virginia). Albert goes on a beach fishing trip with Joseph to warn him off, but Joseph confronts Albert first, revealing that he is an expert 'accident man' who meant for the plank to kill Albert. Joseph admits that Albert has been poisoned through his coffee (as Joseph has built up a tolerance to arsenic). As Albert is dying, he weeps and tells Joseph that he has the wrong man, admitting that it was Cam who made Joseph a cuckold instead.
