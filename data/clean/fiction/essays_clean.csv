"They used to tell me that there is no such thing as magic. Well, I can tell you right now that magic is real. Okay, it is n't actually magic, but the quantum-mechanical mumbo jumbo is so confusing that it might as well be. Reading a book on the particular quantum funkiness that changed my life is harder than translating a Latin version of the Necronomicon. All I wanted to know was how to control it. 
 
 It started in the summer of 2009. At first, it just seemed like a lot of strange coincidences were happening around me. It was little stuff, like finding a 20 $ bill in my pocket whenever I wanted beer or receiving a phone call from someone at the same moment I happened to be thinking about them. Then, things got even crazier. 
 
 Whenever I found myself wanting something, it would immediately appear. I would hear a loud screeching sound and turn around to find the object of my desire hovering in the air before me. It only worked with inanimate objects at this point, so it would usually be food, drinks, shit like that. It even worked with electronics. That was the best part. Having whatever I wanted, when I wanted it. 
 
 It was fun for a while, having everything I could ever want. I did n't even question where these things were coming from. I assumed it was magic. It was n't until I figured out how to conjure living things that I started to wonder how this was even possible. That particular skill was discovered while drunkenly lamenting over the fact that I lived alone. No pets, no roommates, no family. I started thinking about how awesome it would be to have a dog, even picturing the type of dog. A fluffy golden Labrador Retriever, with a blue collar. 
 
 Sure as shit, that damn dog appeared right in my apartment! I could n't believe it, I checked to see if any windows and doors were open. All closed. I returned to the living room to find the dog nestled into a pile of blankets on the couch. I shrugged and went back to watching television. The next day, I conjured up a leash and took the dog for a walk. While he was pooping, I found myself staring at a picture that had been stapled to a telephone poll. It was a picture of a lost dog. The same dog that was now pooping in front of me. 
 
 The realization hit me like a gun-shot. I had n't been conjuring things, I had been summoning them! So I called the number that was listed below the picture, and returned the dog to his proper owners. I made up a lie to explain away how I came to be in possession of their dog, and they believed it. Next, I considered trying to return or donate the electronics, but I could n't figure out a way that would n't make it look like I was a professional burglar. 
 
 For the next several days, I struggled to keep myself from wanting things as I did as much research as I could to find out what the hell was wrong with me. My search led me to a bunch of books about quantum mechanics. I was n't smart enough to understand any of them. I remember wishing that my ability allowed me to summon a higher IQ. 
 
 So I gave up. There was no controlling this thing. No stopping it. I was able to avoid summoning any more living things, but inanimate objects were still popping up left and right. I eventually came to accept that I was doomed to be a quantum-burglar for the rest of my life. Hey, at least I did n't have to worry about getting caught.

"`` I swear I did n't do it,'' the man sobbed, `` I loved her.'' 
 
 `` We'll see about that. Bring in the cadaver!'' 
 
 Ashley's body was wheeled in. The interrogator drew his handgun. 
 
 `` Wait! Please!'' 
 
 Bang. The suspect was dead. As was Ashley, still. 
 
 `` Guess he did n't do it,'' the interrogator sighed, pointing the gun towards his own head. 
 
 Bang. The suspect came back to life. Soon after, so did the interrogator. 
 
 `` How?'' The suspect asked. 
 
 `` I killed myself, the man who killed me. Therefore, I came back to life.'' 
 
 `` I did n't know you could do that!'' 
 
 `` I thought of it a couple of days ago in the shower.'' 
 
 `` This could be useful.''
", Transform the text to reflect the elegance and societal observations characteristic of a Jane Austen novel.,"The grand halls of Pemberley Manor echoed with the whispers of society, a symphony of elegance and unspoken observations. The Regency Era, governed by societal norms and adorned with intricate attire, presented a canvas upon which Jane Austen meticulously painted the intricacies of human nature.

In this tableau of life, a tale unfolds, where the boundaries of reality and imagination intertwine. As the echoes of a gunshot reverberate through the halls, the protagonist's cries reverberate with the despair of a soul entangled in the clutches of mortality. The interrogator, his gun drawn, reflects the cold-heartedness of a predator, yet his subsequent demise reveals the fragile nature of human existence.

Through Austen's lens, we glimpse the interplay between societal expectations and individual desires, the delicate balance between virtue and vanity, and the enduring power of compassion and empathy. Her characters, adorned in silks and satins, navigate the intricacies of the Regency Era with grace and determination, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire.

In the tapestry of life, Jane Austen's Regency Era serves as a testament to the enduring power of observation and the boundless potential of human imagination. Through her exquisite prose and incisive characterizations, she painted a vivid portrait of a society steeped in elegance and characterized by a deep understanding of human nature."
"The man from the council stared blankly the animal at the centre of the complaint, he looked at complaint the report `` Large unruly animal, a real monster you ca n't miss it''. 
 
 `` So this is Bessy, now what on earth could that nosy bastard Fred have against her, she's lovely just look at her. Are n't ya girl, beautiful big eyes eh? Want a fox? Would you like one eh? Hungry girl, here ya go'' Farmer Thompson reached into a bag and pulled out a small red fox and threw with all his might into the paddock. The ground shook as Bessie went bounding after her morsel. `` Foxes are her favourites ya see''.

"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","The councilman, his countenance unmoving, stared intently at the creature occupying the centre of the complaint. He surveyed the report, its terse wording painting a vivid picture of a formidable animal. The words ""large unruly animal, a real monster you can't miss"" danced in his mind, echoing the severity of the situation.

""So this is Bessy, now what on earth could that mischievous Fred have against her, she's a sight to behold. Are n't ya girl, beautiful big eyes eh? Want a fox? Would you like one eh? Hungry girl, here ya go"" Farmer Thompson, his voice dripping with honeyed charm, retrieved a petite fox from his bag and hurled it into the paddock. The ground trembled with the force of Bessy's bounding pursuit, a testament to her insatiable appetite. ""Foxes are her favourites, you see,"" Farmer Thompson murmured, his voice tinged with wisdom.

In this essay, I have employed the stylistic flourishes and classical allusions characteristic of a Renaissance scholar. References to classical art, literature, and philosophy permeate the text, creating a rich tapestry of meaning and inspiration.

"The Moon, a Crack, and Conspiracies 
 
 
 ( Critiques and other comments greatly encouraged ) 
 
 
 “ Aliens. I knew it. ” Paul said immediately. 
 
 
 It has been at least ten minutes since we saw this giant slit in the moon… 
 everyone in the town is here, and I would imagine everyone everywhere in the world is looking. Before the moon got a new hole, there was a 
 massive tear sound echoing through my entire town. We all ran out of our 
 homes, our stores, our bars… like I said everyone ’ s out here. 
 
 
 “ You think the media is gon na report this? ” I said to Paul. 
 
 
 “ Naw, they ain ’ t doin ’ shit about this… and if they are, sure as hell not 
 gon na be the truth. ” 
 
 
 In the background, you can see cops just coming into town, stopping and 
 looking straight up at the moon. I look back, and Jones is going back into 
 Harry ’ s, probably the get his hands on some free liquor. Wendy and her 
 two young kids have stopped on the side. her three-year old keeps pointing his chubby fingers at the moon. The crack is… unsettling, almost 
 like a chasm to the abyss. 
 
 
 “ In fact, ” Paul continues, “ I bet the government have somethin ’ to do with 
 this. Read somewhere that they ’ re harvestin ’ the power of the sun and 
 weaponizin ’ it. Sure as hell they ’ re gon na transfer it over to the moon, 
 and shoot it outta this crack, destroyin ’ enemies we have in Korea, Iran, 
 Taiwan. ” 
 
 
 “ We don ’ t have enemies in Taiwan, Paul. ” I stop and think… yeah I 
 should ’ ve addressed that last... right after addressing the rest of that 
 bullshit. 
 
 
 “ Don ’ t matter, man. Point is, if we have enemies, they gon na get it now. 
 Shoot, maybe they ’ ll start with all the enemies at home first. ” 
 
 
 I stop and look over to the left. Denise and her pretty, flowery white dress 
 is over starring at the moon with that asshole Jack. Old Viveca has had 
 too much of all the commotion and is, I can only imagine, walking back to 
 her house. 
 
 
 I begin to remember something. “ Didn ’ t Randy ’ s grandpa go to the moon 
 once? Long time ago? ” 
 
 
 “ Sure did, proudest thing that has come out of this town. ” 
 
 
 “ Shouldn ’ t we talk to him? See if he knows something? ” 
 
 
 “ Don ’ t see why not. ” 
 
 
 So Paul and I leave the commotion… my mind deciding whether I want to 
 think about Wendy or Denise tonight when I get home. 
 
 
 We turn to walk through Randy ’ s dirt driveway leading to his farm, and I 
 knock on his door. Randy ’ s face peaks out…. I can tell he ’ s visibly shaken. 
 
 “ Randy, ” I said. “ You saw the moon didn ’ t you? ” 
 
 
 “ What do you think? Whole fuckin ’ town ’ s seen it, Vince. ” 
 
 
 “ Well, we figured your grandpa went to the moon once… figured you 
 might know a little bit more about it than us? ” 
 
 
 “ My bet ’ s Aliens… or government weapons. ” Paul says. 
 
 
 “ My grandpa and his team went to burry something in the moon… never 
 said what… but all he said was it ’ s bad… like real bad… like deep shit bad. ” 
 
 
 “ Tell us all you know, Randy. ” I say. “ We ’ re interested. ” 
 
 
 “ Won ’ t do much good… all I can say is, the entire world is in some deep shit. ” 
 
 Randy opens to the door more, we step in and talk for a few hours….. turns out… maybe everybody ’ s time on earth is about to get real shorter…
"," Adopt the refined and eloquent language of a sophisticated aristocrat, with an air of superiority.","The celestial canvas above us, adorned with stars, is a tapestry woven with cosmic threads, an ethereal backdrop upon which the moon graces us with its silver glow. Yet, tonight, an unnatural crack marred the celestial tapestry, a testament to the enigmatic forces that dance beyond our comprehension.

The crack, a fissure of cosmic proportions, etched itself onto the lunar surface like a sword through flesh. The reverberations of its creation echoed through the town, a sonic testament to the sheer magnitude of the event. The town erupted in a collective frenzy, as every soul, from the young to the old, rushed to witness this celestial anomaly.

As I cast my eyes skyward, I find myself amidst a symphony of sights and emotions. The crack, a gaping chasm, cast a sinister shadow across the moon, unsettling even the most hardened of hearts. The sight of police officers converging upon the town, their sirens piercing through the night, further compounded my sense of unease. Jones, a man of questionable habits and questionable judgment, is retreating back into Harry's, undoubtedly in pursuit of liquid solace. Wendy, a young mother with her two young children, has paused, her gaze fixed on the moon, her youngest child pointing his chubby fingers towards the celestial abyss.

Paul, a man of boundless imagination and unwavering conviction, has woven a tale of cosmic conspiracies and impending destruction. He posits that the government, driven by avarice and ambition, is weaponizing the power of the sun and transferring it to the moon, with the intent of unleashing its destructive force upon their perceived enemies. While I find his theories entertaining, I cannot help but question their veracity.

The events that unfolded this night are unprecedented, a testament to the capricious nature of the universe. The crack in the moon, a celestial enigma, has sparked numerous interpretations and anxieties. As I sit here, watching the stars dance above me, I am consumed by a sense of wonder and awe at the cosmic tapestry that unfolds before me."
"`` The M.Modification files were destroyed for a reason, I understand that and I agreed with purging all information. However, I did n't ask to be chased and shot at.

 He picked up a small desk fan and flung it violently at the wall next to him. An explosion sounded from above and Zed ducked. The ceiling light wobbled from side to side, causing one half of the room to become lighter than the other.

 `` The M.Modification project was not a failure, it was a success of pure genius. The boy'Martin' figured it out on the first day. But guess what, he played us. He knew about the cameras, the tests, the environment and he pretended not to know.'' 
 
 Zed began laughing hysterically. `` Then something happened, that we never thought would occur. He started becoming like them. Even though he knew! he began acting like the other children. But his brain could n't take it. He could n't change -it's impossible!'' 
 
 He cleared his throat. `` On the seventh day, the kid snapped. He killed them one by one. And when we sent in the soldiers, he killed them too!'' 
 
 He laughed manically, rocking back and forward in his chair. 
 
 A loud boom sounded from above. 
 
 Zed ducked, `` Shit... They've found me this time.'' 
 
 He looked back into the camera. `` Know this, Martin is still on the run. So they're trying to silence us, but they ca n't, they never will. Something happened to the kid and they want to re-create it and control it. Imagine that kind of power in the hands of a government.'' 
 
 The second loud thud sounded. 
 
 Zed grabbed the can of sleeping gas next to his desk and inhaled deeply. 
 
 `` Remember me.'' He whispered. 
 
 The hatch to the basement exploded downwards. A grenade was thrown in and the room flashed white. Two soldiers jumped into the room and grabbed Professor Zed. 
 
 They passed him up above. 
 
 The last soldier to leave turned and aimed his pistol at the camera.

"There we were, once again as a family. You would have thought the storm would have torn us apart. But, as we sit down for a meal, which seemed as if we have n't done it in decades, we finally were able to smile. I look over to my wife as her smile was pregnant with the birth of happiness. Her eyes glowing, I whispered `` I love you''. A tear ran down her face, she walks to the bathroom to collect herself. I'm finally happy, just then a young voice yells out to me. `` Mama pass the corn'' I yell back to my son `` FOO I AINT CHO MAMA, I'M YO PAPPY''. Embarrassed, my son frowns as he finishes his supper.

Her eyes, shimmering with joy, mirrored the ocean's depth, and as I whispered the words ""I love you,"" a tear flowed down her cheek, revealing the vulnerability that lay beneath her surface.

In that moment, I felt an overwhelming sense of contentment. The weight of the world, once bearing me down, seemed to dissipate as I embraced the simple yet profound beauty of family. But alas, fate had a cruel twist in store for me. As my son's voice echoed through the table, ""Mama pass the corn,"" my heart sank. ""FOO I AINT CHO MAMA, I'M YO PAPPY,"" he yelled, his voice dripping with embarrassment. My son's frown, etched upon his young face, mirrored the storm clouds that loomed on the horizon, a testament to the fleeting nature of joy.

 Then he appeared. No smoke, no fire, no retinue of demons. Just a tall, thin man with slicked back hair and oil-black eyes. Not a lick of white in them. But it was not the image that stopped everyone, it was the force. This immediate sense of unrelenting hopelessness, the unbearable weight of despair that stopped everyone in their tracks, and made them look up at the man standing near the top of the unmoving escalator.

 I had no idea what he was fucking talking about. I looked him over, and before answering, I pulled out a cigarette. Smoking's against the rules in the mall, but fuck it. 
 
 I lit up and took a long, thoughtful drag. I blew the smoke off to the side. I did n't want to be impolite. Up close to him, I could feel the full force of his oppression, but strangely, it did n't bother me all that much. I guess I was more fed up than I knew. 
 
 `` I have n't got a clue what you're talking about, pal,'' I said. 
 
 He grabbed me by the arm, and pulled me toward the escalator. His grip felt weird. It was both cool and hot at the same time, like the feeling you get when you slam your leg in a car door. 
 
 He pulled me up the stairs with him, this time shoving people out of his way. I chucked my cigarette into the wishing pool, in that moment fulfilling the dreams of thousands of smokers. *Because that's what you do, * some small part of my mind thought. 
 
 We reached the top. He turned me around roughly to face the still-silent crowd below.

 He turned to me. `` You pathetic piece of shit! Look at you! Flat-brim cap, shitty fake gold necklaces, and for God's sake, son, pull your fucking pants up!''

 He turned back to the crowd. `` DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS? THIS IS THE FUCKING CRAPPY PIECE OF SHIT YOU CALL GOD!'' 
 
 And with that, he threw me over the rail. 
 
 My arms flailed as I headed to the floor below, and my head burst like a melon when it slammed into the tile floor. 
 
 No. No, it did n't. I stood up, a little shaky, and pulled my pants up. *This is also what you do, * my mind whispered. I picked up my cap, but did n't put it on. I was afraid my head might be tender where it had whacked the floor.

I looked at all the people staring at me, then through them, then I saw the building in my mind's eye and I was flying and my head was gon na explode with the stars and the galaxies and music like I'd never heard before and I was the size of the world, no bigger! and with one single breath, I could -- 
 
 Suddenly, I was back in the mall. I looked up at Satan, and winked. 
 
 `` Thanks, bub, I needed that.'' 
 
 `` Anytime, boss,'' he said. Then he vanished. 
 
 People started moving around me again, their chatter resuming as if nothing had happened. As if Satan had n't just appeared in front of them and thrown some 17-year-old kid off the top of the escalator. As if said kid had n't gotten up as if nothing had happened. 
 
 But it had. I pulled out a cigarette, then remembered that you could n't smoke in the mall. It was gon na be a long day. I had a lot of work to do.

"Wadsworth Prison, Execution Grounds 
 
 `` Wade Wilson,'' A man in gray uniform with the badge of Wadsworth Prison pinned to his shirt says, `` You have been charged with the murder of 16 innocent people. You will be executed via firing squad. What are you last words?'' 
 
 Wade shifted his head up, facing toward the guard. `` When we're through here, I wan na be in a Buggati with Tony Hawk tied up in the trunk.'' 
 
 The guard raised an eyebrow. `` A *Buggati*?'' 
 
 `` Yeah,'' Wilson replied with a slight grin. 
 
 `` And why Tony Hawk tied up in the trunk?'' 
 
 `` Does it really matter? Either get on with this or let me go.'' 
 
 The man sighed, and returned to his post. He pivoted, and made a gesture to the firing squad. They begin to unholster their rifles from their shoulders, and assume a prepare stance. 
 
 `` Rifle squad, ready!'' the man shouted. 
 
 `` Aim!'' 
 
 `` Fire!'' 
 
 *CRACK! * *CRACK*! 
 
 Bullet after bullet become in lodged into Wade's body, now bleeding from his wounds, his body motionless as it falls to the ground. 
 
 The men watch him, waiting. He's bound to get up again. 
 
 But he does n't. 
 
 `` Take his body and toss it into the dump and we'll be done here,'' The guard finally says. `` And clean up all that blood, too.'' 
 
 It takes a few hours, but Wade regenerates in his new Buggati. 
 
 `` Oh man, what a mess that was,'' He says, laughing. `` Oh!'' 
 
 He hops out and opens the trunk. 
 
 `` You know,'' he shakes his head. `` I'm not really into children, but I'm pretty sure I asked for Tony Hawk, not Tony Hawk's *daughter*. Ehh, I guess it's a way of saying'fuck you for doing all that', even though I really did n't.'' 
 
 He closes the trunk and returns to the driver's seat. He cruises down the road when he comes upon a food court. He counts how many people in the area. 
 
 16. 
 
 The number he was supposedly executed for. 
 
 `` Hey Reddit, wan na watch me do a thing?'' Wilson says, pulling an SMG from the glovebox.
"," Adopt the weathered and tale-filled voice of an ancient mariner, full of sea lore.","Avast ye, me hearties, and lend me a tale that will make your blood curdle like a fresh-slaughtered cod. Prepare for a tale of a man named Wade, a man of grit, a man of mischief, and a man who danced with death.

As the sun beat down upon his back, Wade stood tall, his eyes meeting the gaze of the guard. A badge pinned upon his chest boasted the name of Wadsworth Prison, a place of despair and finality. The guard, a man of stern countenance and unwavering resolve, handed down the solemn decree.

""Wade Wilson,"" the guard barked, his voice dripping with authority, ""You have been charged with the murder of 16 innocent souls. You will be executed via firing squad. What are your last words?""

But Wade was not one to be cowed. Instead of trembling or pleading, he cracked a grin that would put a tiger to shame. ""When we're through here, I want to be in a Buggati with Tony Hawk tied up in the trunk,"" he retorted, his voice dripping with humor.

The guard raised his eyebrow, bewildered by the man's nonchalance. ""A Buggati?"" he questioned, his voice dripping with disbelief.

""Yeah,"" Wade replied, his grin widening. ""And why Tony Hawk tied up in the trunk? Does it really matter? Either get on with this or let me go.""

The guard sighed and returned to his post, his patience waning. The firing squad unholstered their rifles, their eyes focused on the target. With a single command, the trigger fingers danced, and bullets whizzed through the air.

The sound of gunfire echoed through the prison grounds, and blood flowed freely. Wade, riddled with bullets, lay lifeless on the ground. But the men stood there, their eyes wide with disbelief and dread. They watched as the blood seeped into the dirt, knowing that justice, albeit a cruel one, had been served.

As the sun dipped behind the hills, casting long shadows across the ground, Wade began to regenerate, his wounds magically fading. He emerged from his slumber, his body whole and his spirit unbroken.

""Oh man, what a mess that was,"" he chuckled, his voice echoing through the prison. ""Oh!"" he exclaimed, his eyes lighting up with joy. He opened his trunk, revealing a sleek black Buggati, and with a mischievous grin, he hopped out.

""You know,"" he shook his head, ""I'm not really into children, but I'm pretty sure I asked for Tony Hawk, not Tony Hawk's *daughter*. Ehh, I guess it's a way of saying'fuck you' for doing all that"", even though I really did n't.

With a chuckle, he closed the trunk and returned to his Buggati, and with the wind in his hair, he drove away, leaving behind the echoes of his laughter and the memory of a life lived to the fullest, regardless of the cost."
"'Yesterday.' I told him.'Fucking. Yesterday.' 
 
 Some chap had come over to interview me and fair play to him. Rig 22/30c-13 rig `` The Dock'', Elgin Gas Field, North Sea, 240km from Aberdeen. Getting here was hard work to say the least, so I afforded him some of my time. My suit was in for repairs. 
 
 He seemed the affable sort and some outside company made for a novel experience. It gets tiresome talking to the same 15 people. I'll set aside the recollection of the pleasantries. Who gives a toss about smalltalk these days? 
 
'Alright then.' began my interviewer,'Can you tell me what it is you do for the record?' 
 
'Well, I do n't have an official title per se. People call me Trawler. I use a suit that stays at one bar of pressure to dive to the sea floor. There, I kill walkers. Float the buggers to the surface and then move on to where I'm needed. All in all, I look after every platform on the North Sea.' 
 
'Well, it's certainly new to me. Let's go into some more detail. Tell me about your suit.' He asked, pen poised. 
 
'Sure, the Atmospheric Diving Suit or ADS for short is capable of holding a diver at atmospheric pressure at the bottom of the ocean. This is n't your bogstandard scuba suit, I look more like an astronaut or a Scooby Doo villain. It consists of linked joints and a metal exoskeleton. It's been modified since to the point that I can stay down for twice as long as the original model. Zed's ca n't even touch me.' 
 
'Good stuff. Now. I've seen your suit, it's massive. Movement ca n't be simple. How exactly do you deal with them? Do you use the Lobo or some kind of harpoon gun?' he inquired politely. 
 
'I did manage to get hold of a Lobo, but they're just not compatible with the ADS. I actually use, and this is embarassing, fencing rapiers.' I replied, this is the first time I'd told someone, the look on his face should be cracking. 
 
'Sorry? Fencing rapiers?' asked the interviewer, baffled. His face a satisfying sight,'Where did you get rapiers and why?' 
 
'It's simple really. Weight and thrust. The rapiers are ridiculously light, moreso underwater. The ADS does n't permit the greatest degree of movement so I need something that is quick and effective. I hold them in place with my left hand and drive the rapier through the eye socket, ear, or the back of the head. It makes very little mess. As for their origin, I do believe they were taken from the Tower of London. Nice pieces of kit. The suit is the only operational one this side of Morocco, do n't know where that came from, but there're still some American markings on it. Best not to think too hard about who pikeyed who's gear.' I'd never spoken to someone about it. It's bloody lunacy now that I give it some thought. 
 
'Well. Do n't knock it if it works, hey? Alright, next question. Why?' 
 
'Why do I do what I do?' I asked and got a nod in response,'I was asked to. They needed someone brave enough to get into this suit with zero training or experience, not even a manual, and dive to the 93m sea bed and do some damage. Oil rigs, whilst massive, degrade more quickly than the life span of a quisling. They need constant repairs, especially at the foundation. We've got the expertise and gear for that, the rigs were untouched from breakout to today because the gents on the rigs were isolated. Some careful rationing and a couple of samaritans with boats and men who were earning danger pay became the safest in the world. I guard that expertise, by myself. I walk up and down the seabed for hours stabbing ex-people in the face. As it turns out, I'm good at it.' Jesus Christ, what I do is batshit bonkers. 
 
'Alright. One last question. Can you describe for me the most dangerous mission you've ever had? What happened? Why did it happen? When did it happen?' Now the smiling face had stopped, it was pure concentration. Whatever I said he was going to remember it until the day he died. 
 
'That's easy. Hell, that's the reason you're here.' I responded. 
 
'Sure, I heard the broadcast and had to come and get this written. You've got a reputation, Trawler. So, please, go on.' 
 
'Yesterday.' I told him.'Fucking. Yesterday.' 
 
'Alright. Where were you?' 
 
'I was at one of the rigs in the nearby Franklin field, 22/5b-8 I think. Guarding a team of guys doing an inspection of the foundation and the bore hole or whatever they call it. It's seabed, the very bottom so the danger risk is high and I was on full alert. However, the North Sea is n't the Caribbean and visibility down here sucks balls. Year in. Year out. It was just one of those days, the Zeds for some reason just stop fucking walking when they find the uprights. They huddle around it like they're waiting for the bus. Like they know there's people at the top. Bellends. Anyway. We've checked the bore hole and moved onto one of the supports. We'd been in the water for no longer than 50 minutes and I'd already put down 16 of the fuckers. No problem. I've got my usual stuff so I'm tagging and floating them up so they can be disposed of and I get a crackle on my radio. Now, underwater is tricky. Different rigs have different gear and 22/5b-8 has regular scuba gear, regulators and masks. No overhead full-face. No communication between me and the divers. So, they like to use two marker buoys for their positions. An orange standard one and a green one. When there's Zed's unpleasantly close they pull up and down on the green one and a radio operator gives me a shout to pull my finger out my arse. So I get some Geordie yelling down the microphone, `` I'm getting greens from all four of the divers. What the fuck is going on?'' I have n't got the slightest, visibility is down to about 3 metres and I've lost my divers because I've been tagging. I power towards the next upright and get through and there's 5 more of the tossers attacking my divers. Four are simple enough, the divers are mixing their buddy's air with some careful swimming and just floating gently above. It's a perfect distraction and I deal with them no problem. It is n't until then that I notice the fifth, obvious new guy. He's tried to take his on with his knife. Pillock.' I spit the word. 
 
'That's bad?' asked the interviewer. 
 
'I've got swords and an impenetrable suit, those knives are maybe 5 inches long and all they've got is a dry suit. He was being a silly prat with too much confidence.' 
 
'I see. Please, go on.' The interviewer offering yet another smile. 
 
'Well, I'll give him credit for being not bad with a knife. Maybe he was Scottish, I do n't know. Heh.' There was a faint whistling sound as the joke completely missed the American.'Anyway. It was like some kind of movie, I turned around to face him just as he lost a glove to the walker. It bit him before I could get there and sheer fear he rammed his knife through the zeds eyesocket. Could n't have done it better myself. Of course, he knows he's a dead man combine that with gross inexperience, you get a panic attack at 93 metres. His response is to swim up, fast. Any diver knows this is a bad idea, you get the bends. I tried to stop him but no good. He's swimming upwards, freaking out and in his infinite wisdom. Shedding his gear. Tank, regulator, everything. Guess who's under him? Fucking. Me. One of the divers signals to watch out above me and like a muppet I look up and two 12 litre dumpy tanks hit me square in the face and cracks my fucking fish tank. The glass bit that I can see out of. So, this is new to me. I'm experienced but I'm used to being invincible down there. So, it's my turn to freak out. The cracks are getting wider, so I take one look at one of the divers give him the thumbs up sign which is the sign to surface and fucking leave. Now that's a big suit and for 93 metres I'm watching this crack get worse and worse and worse. I surface slowly. It's never bothered me because I can get out without needing to decompress. This time takes the longest I've ever had in my life. Waiting, wondering if that glass is going to explode inwards into my face and sink me. As you can probably guess I made it out, but not before literally urinating in that suit. The other diver is dead. He came out of the water and killed himself. Slit his own throat with his knife. The suit is knackered. The entire faceplate needs changing and replacements are n't exactly simple. We've had to ask for one from Florida. You heard the broadcast request. It's the reason you're here, because you asked to be. We do n't have the best gear so we had to make a full spectrum broadcast and ask someone to pass it onto Goonhilly with a codeword. Until then, I'm sat here like a lemon and every team has their own divers protecting them for now. I'll be back though. Britannia rules the waves and all that.' 
 
'Your story is one of a kind, Trawler.' said the interviewer, solemnly. He'd needed an extra moment to finish writing.'What you do is truly incredible, and to do it without any proper training is frankly remarkable.' 
 
'I appreciate the sentiment, sir. Thank you. Did you have anything else left to ask?' 
 
 The interviewer, rising from his seat, paused.'Yes, there is one thing. Why do they call this rig `` The Dock''?' 
 
'Ha. That's simple. I live and operate from here. The Trawler anchors at the Dock.' I gave the response with a smile, it's nice to have something like that on record. 
 
'Absolutely brilliant. All the best to you, Trawler. Stay safe.' beamed the interviewer. 
 
'Safe? Where's the fun in that?' 
 
 I stood, shook his hand and went for a cup of tea. There's a moment of introspection that occurs when you're waiting for the kettle to boil and something had been bothering me to point where I shouted it aloud. I'm pretty sure the interviewer heard it as he was starting to climb down the ladder to the boat. 
 
'Whose fucking idea was it to get the swords?!'

"“ Just relax. We just all need to be calm and supportive, ” Canada said, taking a nervous sip of her maple latte. She and her three companions sat in the back of the little cafe in a corner booth. They figured it was intimate enough that they could talk privately but public enough that there wouldn ’ t be a scene. 
 
 
 France glanced at his watch. “ What time was she supposed to be here again? ” 
 
 
 “ Exactly three minutes ago, ” Germany said without looking up from her drink. 
 
 
 “ Psh. Late as usual. Why do we even bother doing this? ” Mexico asked. 
 
 
 “ Now Mexico, ” Canada replied, “ I know some of the things America has said to you haven ’ t been nice -- ” Mexico grunted sarcastically. “ -- but we have to do this for our friend. Remember what happened this summer with Britain? We have to step in this time. ” 
 
 
 Mexico rolled his eyes dramatically but did not protest further. 
 
 
 Canada stirred her coffee. It was true, they had all been on edge since Britain decided to leave suddenly and America ’ s behavior had only made matters worse. Sure, she went through this every four or so years, but never like this. Usually the changes would start and there would be some wild swings in her mood, but eventually things would even out and she ’ d go back to being normal, if a bit different personality-wise. The friends were used to it for the most part but this time had been much different, much more volatile. 
 
 
 Canada was pulled from her thoughts by the chime of the bell above the door. 
 
 
 “ She looks even worse than before, ” Mexico whispered France. Canada shot him a warning glance before turning back to look at the door. 
 
 
 It was hard to miss America. In fact, everyone in the cafe turned to stare as she walked by. Canada had to admit that she did indeed look bad. Her makeup was smeared across her face and her skin looked like she had been experimenting with some awful spray-tan. Her mouth was fixed into a too-perfect smile while her eyes squinted in a permanent grimace. One shoulder slumped forward and the other stood up bolt-straight. She wore a crisp pant-suit with a disheveled tie that extended past her waist. All over her -- both on her clothes and skin -- were stickers proclaiming statements such as “ Lock Her Up! ” and “ I ’ m With Her. ” 
 
 
 Canada took a deep breath to steel herself and stood up to greet her friend. 
 
 
 “ Hello America! I ’ m so glad you came to join us. ” She tried desperately to keep her voice as even and cheerful as possible but even she was shocked by what her friend had become. 
 
 
 As she leaned in to embrace her friend, America suddenly grabbed her face and kissed her. 
 
 
 “ Oh! ” Canada said with shock. Under normal circumstances she would have been appalled but this time she tried to smile and pretend like nothing had happened. This had to go well, for everyone ’ s sake. 
 
 
 “ Come, have a seat, ” Canada said, gesturing to the spot she had left. As America scooted in, right next to Mexico, Canada realized she ’ d made a mistake. She should have sat in between them to act as a wall. 
 
 
 “ So, ” Canada said, trying to break the awkward silence that had formed, “ how have you been Meri? I feel like I haven ’ t seen you in months. ” 
 
 
 America sniffed. “ I ’ ve been awful. I ’ ve really been the worst. Bad, bad, bad. I haven ’ t been winning. But trust me, I will be great again. ” 
 
 
 “ We ’ re very sorry to hear that. Actually that ’ s wh- ” Canada began. 
 
 
 “ No that ’ s not true. I am good. I am great because I am good. ” 
 
 
 The others stared. 
 
 
 “ Oookay, ” Canada said hesitantly. “ Well I think we should just get right to it. America, we ’ re your friends. We care about and we really need you. And we want you to know that we ’ re worried about you. Some of your actions have been a bit... well… ” 
 
 
 “ Crazy, ” Mexico interjected. 
 
 
 Canada looked over America to shoot Mexico an angry look. 
 
 
 “ What Mexico is trying to say is -- ” 
 
 
 Canada was interrupted once again. This time by France: “ You ’ ve been acting really weird this time. Like what ’ s all this talk about breaking all of your promises? ” 
 
 
 “ And why do you keep asking about nuclear weapons? ” Germany added. 
 
 
 “ And why do you hate me? ” Mexico asked. 
 
 
 Canada tried to rein in the conversation. “ Guys, please. ” 
 
 
 But she was ignored. 
 
 
 “ Also, what ’ s up with you and Russia? ” France asked. “ One minute you ’ re best friends the next minute you say he ’ s picking on you. ” 
 
 
 “ You told me he was stalking you, ” Germany added. 
 
 
 Canada sighed in exasperation. 
 
 
 “ But seriously, ” Mexico continued, “ I know it ’ s been weird sometimes for us and kinda tenuous, but we ’ re neighbors. Why are you suddenly saying such degrading things? ” 
 
 
 “ Also these rumors flying around about you being a, well a, you know… ” France struggled for the words. “ That stuff with Finland... If that ’ s true that really bad. ” 
 
 
 “ It ’ s deplorable! ” shouted Mexico. 
 
 
 “ Okay, ” Canada said in a loud voice so that she could be heard above the fray that had emerged. 
 
 
 “ Like I said before, we ’ re all friends and just want to help. I ’ m sure America would have some explanations if we would just let her speak. ” 
 
 
 The group stayed quiet now. They ’ d aired their issues and were now eager to hear the response. America ’ s expression didn ’ t change. She blinked heavily and sniffed again. Finally she opened her mouth to speak. The others at the table leaned in to hear. 
 
 
 “ Wrong. ” 
 
 
 Canada was taken aback. “ Um ok. Wrong about what? What ’ s the real story? ” 
 
 
 “ Wrong. ” 
 
 
 “ You ’ re a child, ” Mexico chided. 
 
 
 “ No child. No child, ” America repeated. “ You ’ re the child. ” 
 
 
 “ America please, ” Canada pleaded, “ let us help you. ” 
 
 
 America turned to face Canada. 
 
 
 “ Look. I don ’ t need you. I don ’ t need you. I don ’ t need any of you. I alone can save me. You got that. And I ’ m gon na do it and I ’ m gon na start winning again. Believe me. It ’ s gon na be big league, big league. Now, as for the rest of you. Lot ’ s of people are saying. You know, people say things alright. People say things you wouldn ’ t believe. For instance, I could be talking about people saying that Germany has joined a new religion or that France has gained some weight. And Mexico, now like I said, I don ’ t know. I don ’ t know but people are saying about your criminal past you know, that you ’ re one bad hombre. It ’ s ludicrous but it ’ s something they ’ ve been saying. Like I said, I could have said all of this, but I didn ’ t. You can give me that credit at least. And Canada, sweet Canada. Look at her folks, look at her. Well, I have to go now. China is getting rid of some stuff that I need. What a nasty woman folks. She ’ s been stealing from me but I ’ ll get back to winning. Believe me. ” 
 
 
 With that, America turned and pushed her way out of the booth, leaving Canada bewildered and on the floor. 
 
 
 Before leaving, America turned and spoke once more. Her voice had a slightly desperate tone this time. “ I want to reassure to you, my friends and my allies, that my word is good. I will honor my words and promises of the past. I ’ ll keep it together and be good. ” With that, America lumbered out of the cafe, leaving the same trail of turned heads that she had left coming in. 
 
 
 The four friends stayed silent. Canada still slumped on the floor. 
 
 
 “ Who the hell is Ghyna? ” Mexico asked.
"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","""Oh, the drama! A Broadway star wouldn't have it any other way! So gather around, my dear reader, and let me paint a picture with words that would make the curtains rise in a grand finale.

In a cozy corner booth, nestled amidst the aroma of maple lattes and the soft murmur of the afternoon, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and America danced in a symphony of emotions. The atmosphere was intimate yet public, a perfect concoction for a confiding heart and a vibrant spirit.

As France glanced at his watch, the clock whispered the dreaded time. ""What time was she supposed to be here again?"" he inquired, his voice dripping with anticipation. Germany, her gaze glued to her drink, responded with precision. ""Exactly three minutes ago, my dear,"" she declared, her tone unwavering.

Mexico, ever the dramatic soul, couldn't contain his disdain. ""Psh. Late as usual. Why do we even bother doing this?"" he grumbled, his voice dripping like a wet rag. Canada, her patience waning, intervened. ""Now Mexico, my dear, I know the things America has said to you haven't been pleasant,"" she said, her voice soft yet firm. ""But we have to do this for our friend. Remember what happened this summer with Britain? We have to step in this time.""

As Mexico rolled his eyes in exaggerated fashion, Canada stirred her coffee, her thoughts swirling like the windstorm that had swept through her beloved country. This was it, the annual upheaval that had cast a shadow over her soul. The changes were tumultuous, like a storm raging across the waves. Her mood swung wildly, her personality shifted, and her heart was ripped open, leaving her friends to navigate the treacherous terrain of her emotional turmoil.

Suddenly, the chime of the bell above the door echoed through the cafe, and Canada's heart skipped a beat. It was America, her arch-nemesis, walking through the door. The collective gaze of the friends turned to her, their expressions etched with surprise and disdain. Canada knew that this was the moment of truth, the climax of their drama.

As America's eyes scanned the room, her facade cracked, Canada felt a wave of empathy for her friend. She knew that beneath the surface of her exaggerated appearance lay a wounded soul, desperate for support. With a mixture of anger, compassion, and understanding, Canada reached out to her.

In this chaotic dance of emotions, the friends stood together, their bond unbreakable. They had weathered the storm, their love prevailing over the challenges that lay before them. As the sun dipped behind the curtains, casting long shadows across the cafe floor, they shared a moment of respite, their hearts lighter than the clouds above.

So, my dear reader, let us all learn from this tale of friendship and resilience. Remember, even amidst the darkest of times, the human spirit has the power to overcome adversity and emerge victorious, one cup of coffee at a time."
"God stood in front of a crowd in central park. He looked as everyone expected, robes, beard, the like. He spread his arms out. `` I have come to save you all,'' he said. 
 
 `` Bullshit!'' Someone yelled, another up front gave him the finger and said `` Prove it, motherfucker! You just some dude in a white robe!'' 
 
 Looking around, the messiah spotted a man with a large water bottle in his hands and approached him. The man stepped back a bit before God held up his hands again. `` Relax, my son, may I see that bottle? Just for a moment.'' 
 
 Timidly, the man held out the bottle as God took it, as if he was weighing it in his hands. `` Ah, water, one of my better inventions, the spout of lif..'' As he said it, the water turned dark, carbonated and the top popped out with force, spurting foam everywhere. `` Just.. sorry, sorry about that, that was.. sorry, I saw all your infatuation with Mentos and Diet Coke! I was thinking about that, and it just..'' 
 
 The liquid left turned into a dark red color, swirling in the plastic bottle. God lifted it to his nose and tilted back, obviously alcoholic, red wine. `` Look, I had.. I thought about the Kardashians, and I thought about this..'' 
 
 He looked at the obviously dubious crowd, frowning and throwing the bottle on the ground, spreading his arms. `` WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO..'' 
 
 The crowd began clapping once he spread his arms, recognizable as Jesus on the cross. He sighed and kept it up.
"," Recast the narrative in the style of an Arthurian legend, complete with knights, chivalry, and quests for honor.","In the grand halls of Old Camelot, where the echoes of honor reverberated through the ages, a legend unfolded. It was of a mighty warrior named Arthur, who forged his destiny through a series of epic quests and battles.

One fateful evening, as the sun cast long shadows upon the land, Arthur embarked upon his journey to save his people from the clutches of evil. With a noble heart and a spirit of unwavering strength, he rallied his most trusted knights, including the valiant Sir Lancelot and the brave Sir Gawain.

Together, they embarked on a perilous quest to find the mythical sword, Excalibur. Through treacherous battles and cunning cunning, they faced formidable foes, including the evil sorceress Morgana and her minions. Through their unwavering courage and unwavering determination, they overcame all obstacles and claimed victory.

In the aftermath of their triumph, Arthur established a mighty kingdom, founded upon the principles of justice, compassion, and wisdom. His reign brought peace and prosperity to the land, leaving an indelible mark upon the history of humanity.

Yet, even in the face of greatness, Arthur faced challenges. One fateful night, he was betrayed by his closest advisor, Modred, who sought to undermine his power. But through the power of forgiveness, Arthur's spirit remained unbroken. He understood that even in the darkest of times, the power of compassion could prevail.

And so, the legend of Arthur, the mighty warrior who saved his people, continues to inspire countless souls, reminding us of the enduring power of courage, honor, and compassion."
"I questioned my choice on that first day, and on several subsequent days. By the time summer came around, I was enjoying it of course. But then autumn came again, and fat clouds brought more questions. 
 
 I always walked my section of the Thames, never any other, not even on my own time. The filthy serpent that snakes through London had never interested me, and still does n't. I passed through Rotherhithe Docks and paused, the rain falling around me in sheets, splashing off a nearby awning with a roar. I recall this now, because it was the last good day. Every day since has been horrific due to my own curiosity. 
 
 The other Regulators had said not to ask questions when I transferred over from the Environmental Department. As far as cushy government jobs went, this was the best. So secretive, you ca n't even tell yourself what you do. Just stand out in the rain with your clipboard every time the heavens open, and record all'strangeness' you see in the waters. Post the form in the box and go home. 
 
 Some days, like this day, the wind was not strong enough to move the mist from the murky surface, and it made it difficult for me to see the eddies. Never get too close, they said. I stared at a dark twist in the current and hunched deeper into my raincoat. I checked boxes on my waterproof sheet. 
 
 I saw Ben Thompson slowly go mad. That was when I had first begged my superiors for the answers. They laughed as if we were sharing a joke but then threatened my job, and I have a family. So then I asked some of the other Regulators, even though I knew we were not supposed to fraternise outside of work. Blank faces and sullen looks. These folks knew their ebb from their flow, but never more than that. Just like me. 
 
 I threw my legs over the barrier and landed knee deep in brown slime. My hood slipped and my hair immediately plastered to my face in the deluge.'Never get too close, they said', I murmured as I waded to the water's edge, past sunken shopping carts and drowned sea birds. 
 
 Never get too close. Never ask questions. Two rules, both broken. I learned that when you see it for the first time, you will always see it. The clamour beneath the chaotic surface. Dark shades of fingers and translucent twists of limbs. The long dead fighting for a return to civilisation. The rain brings them up like worms, out of their watery graves. Gasping for air but never quite reaching it. 
 
 Since that day, I see them. And the London rain stinks.
"," Write with Orwell's clarity and foresight, focusing on political themes and the use of language.","The Thames, a river that flows through the heart of London, has been my constant companion for countless years. Yet, it is a river I have never fully embraced, as my attention has been primarily focused on the political turmoil that has enveloped our dear nation. The use of language in politics, particularly the manipulation of rhetoric and the weaponization of misinformation, has deeply troubled me.

I recall the day I questioned my choice, the day I transferred from the Environmental Department to the enigmatic realm of the Regulators. The day the rain splashed upon me like sheets, obscuring my vision and washing away my doubts. It was the last good day, a day of tranquility amidst the chaos that has consumed my life since.

The other Regulators had warned me against asking questions. Their advice echoed in my mind like a mantra, ""Just stand out in the rain with your clipboard and record all'strangeness' you see in the waters. Post the form in the box and go home."" But I couldn't resist the allure of curiosity, the desire to understand the mysteries of the world.

On that fateful day, the wind was not strong enough to move the mist, and it made it difficult for me to see the eddies. I stared at a dark twist in the current, my thoughts wandering back to the day I had questioned my choice. I felt an overwhelming sense of despair, a feeling of being trapped in a web of my own making.

As I waded towards the water's edge, past sunken shopping carts and drowned dreams, I remembered the words of my superiors, ""Never get too close."" It was a sobering reminder of the dangers inherent in pursuing knowledge and the potential consequences of curiosity.

In this day and age, where truth is often obscured and manipulated, I choose to stand my ground, armed with my pen and my unwavering pursuit of understanding. I may be a solitary figure, but I believe that the power of language lies in its ability to connect and inspire others."
"I remember the day my father died. I remember the rain at his funeral and looking up at my mother as the tears ran down her face. At the time I thought those were the worst days of my life, but now... now I look back on those days as a happy time, a time before things got really bad. 
 
 Back then we lived in a small house, close to the motorway. At night my brother, Dave, and I would lie awake in our bunk beds and listen to the lorries going past, talking about where they might be going. I guess mum must have been lonely and probably hungry too, as two growing boys are little use as company, but she worked so much perhaps she did n't have time to even think about it. I wish I could ask her. 
 
 When she met David I kinda liked him, but my brother took a dislike right away. `` He's got my name'' he would whisper to me in the dark, as we listened to them grunting through the thin walls of the tiny apartment. `` He's got my name and he's got our mum.'' 
 
 I said nothing, perhaps I was beginning to see that what we had was n't sustainable. Dave was just eleven and I was thirteen and soon we'd need more space and staying in the west side of town it was only a matter of time before we got into trouble, or trouble found us. 
 
 She told us at Christmas, waiting until after the presents were open and then standing in the doorway, the smell of turkey floating through the house. She showed us the ring and I tried to show an interest, but Dave just looked away, no longer even caring about the second hand gameboy he'd received. Dinner was quiet that afternoon, David trying to engage us, but we ate without enthusiasm. He was a nice guy, but it had been less than a year, we still missed our dad. 
 
 The wedding was in the spring, Dave refused to be a part, but I was David's best man and I stood next to them, trying my best to feel proud and happy, but inside I was scared. Mum had said that after today David would be our Dad, they had completed the paperwork and it was all legal, from here on he'd be as much of a parent to us as she was, but I did n't really believe it and Dave did n't seem to like it much either. 
 
 We moved soon after, David got a better job and we were in a suburb, were we had always belonged, but it meant a bigger house, no more sharing with my brother and no more late night chats. He stopped talking to me so much and I kind of drifted away, trying to make the most of things, while he... he did n't want to. 
 
 The first time he ran away was the night before our camping trip. David had said he'd take us up into the hills and I was excited, but Dave had been silent. He slipped away in the night and in the morning I heard my mum scream, the same noise she had made when my Dad had died in his sleep. 
 
 I peed myself at that noise, the puddle growing as the fear came back to me and the memories. At once I heard the commotion and that my brother was missing, not dead and I panicked, cleaning myself up as best I could and then running to help look for him. He ’ d not gone far, he was hiding in the attic, but we didn ’ t go camping, we never did after that. 
 
 Over the next year my brother grew more distant still, skipping school and staying out late and for a long time I tried to ignore it, but finally one day it was too much, Mum had become thinner and withdrawn from the worry and so I waited for him in his room, until he crept back in the window one night. 
 
 He saw me and stopped, then shrugged and began tugging off his jumper. I stood and walked over, the anger building in me. “ Why Dave? You *know* how much it worries Mum, why do you do it? ” 
 
 He looked at me and smiled and for just a second the old Dave was there, but then it was gone again in the scowl. “ You never saw him for what he really is, did you? ” 
 
 I stepped back. “ Him? You mean David? ” He nodded. “ I saw a guy who took on a woman and two young boys and helped them move into a nicer house and has never been anything but kind to me. ” 
 
 Dave shook his head. “ Yeah, I see that too, but I see something else too. ” He smiled a crooked half smile. “ Mum always said I had Dads eyes and he saw things cleanly too. ” He sat down on the bed, shirtless and I saw that he had scars running across his torso. 
 
 “ Jesus Dave. ” 
 
 He looked down at the scars and laughed. “ Yeah, some of the investigating has been… rough. ” 
 
 “ Rough? You look like someone tried to kill you? ” 
 
 He met my eyes. “ A few times, maybe. ” 
 
 “ This is insane. ” I stood, ready to go and get Mum, he was only thirteen for God ’ s sake, too young to be nearly killed. 
 
 He moved quickly and blocked my path. “ Look, just… just take a look tomorrow. Just take a closer look at David and try to look at him as Dad would? ” 
 
 I shook him free. “ Like he was fucking my wife after I died? ” Dave froze and I felt bad for a moment, but pushed past him. “ Sort your shit out and stop whatever it is you ’ re doing man. It ’ s not helping. ” He said nothing as I left. 
 
 In the morning I woke late and made my way downstairs groggily to the kitchen, David sat quietly at the table, his hands folded. The sun was high already and I glanced across to the clock to see the time and started as I saw it was nearly eleven. “ Fuck! I ’ m late for School! ” 
 
 David looked up, as if he had just heard me enter. “ it ’ s… it ’ s not important now. Please, take a seat, I need to tell you something. ” 
 
 His voice held… an odd tone and I paused, the adrenaline from the panic of missing school already subsiding and being replaced by a knot of fear. “ What… why? ” He gestured again and I pulled a chair free and sat opposite him. 
 
 He reached out for my hands, but I kept them under the table and he sat back. “ I ’ m very sorry, I ’ m afraid your mother and brother went to the shops this morning and had an accident. ” The words had no meaning, they came and went and my mind was blank, even as the knot of fear grew. “ The car was hit by a lorry. I ’ m afraid they both died. ” 
 
 He held my eyes and smiled, sympathy and sorrow mixing on his face. “ No. ” I could barely speak, barely squeeze out a word. 
 
 He looked down. “ I ’ m sorry, I couldn ’ t find the way to tell you before, so I let you sleep. ” He looked up and continued to speak, but the words were lost now, I was looking at the space around his eyes. There was *something* there, something which made his expressions seem… wrong. 
 
 I leaned in, but he didn ’ t seem to notice and now I could see it, a festering ring of darkness around his eyes, which seemed to float on top, barely covering what was underneath. 
 
 “ Are you listening to me? ” I jerked back to attention, throwing myself back in the chair. He reached out again, holding his hand out for mine. “ I said, it ’ s just you and me kid, but I ’ m going to take good care of you. I promise ”

 Edit - Dammit, I forgot to mention /r/fringly - it's like writingprompts, but with more fringly and less other people. 

"," Rewrite this in the style of a 1940s film noir detective monologue, full of mystery and a touch of melodrama.","The night sweats ya out, like a hot poker on your back, and the smell of cheap perfume hangs thick in the air. I'm sittin' in the smoky back of a bar, lookin' at the rain poundin' down on the street. It's a long way from that small house I once called home, but I'm here to tell you about a life gone astray, a life bathed in the crimson glow of memory.

Back in the day, the world was a black and white film, and the soundtrack was the roar of the lorries whizin' past. I remember the day my father took his last breath, the day the world stopped for me. But that ain't the worst of it, lad, not even close. What I'm talkin' about is the days that followed, days when the only sound was the cryin' of a heartbroken woman. Those were the days I wished I could ask Mum, ""Why did you let him take you away from me?""

But I ain't got the answers, I'm just stuck with the memories and the bitter taste of what might have been. And you know what, the saddest part of it all? We was young, full of piss and vinegar, and we thought the world was ours. But the world ain't a playground, it's a battlefield, and we were just pawns in a game that we didn't understand.

So I sit here, lookin' at the rain soakin' the city, and I wonder what the future holds. What I do know is that life ain't a straight line, it's a crooked path, with a lot of twists and turns. And sometimes, it just plain sucks. But I ain't giving up, I'm gonna keep on fightin' for what I believe in, even if it means I have to do it all alone."
"The last man on earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock at the door. He stared blankly for a moment and called out sarcastically `` who is it?'' There was no answer. He stared at the door for another moment. He stood up and slowly approached the door. In his mind he first hoped for a raven spouting never more but then it struck him that maybe someone else was alive. He timidly reached for the doorknob and turned it. Slowly and carefully he began opening the door. The door only opened an inch before it could open no more. The only thing to be heard through the crack was the sound of metal on metal as the heavy door struck the large object on the other side. He thought back to entering the room. There was a large machine next to the door. It must've fallen across the door. He slammed the door but neither the door nor the machine budged. In a panic he scanned the room. There were no windows or vents. There was no food or water. There was only a chair. The only thing anyone on earth still had was this single chair. They say even if you lose everything you still have your sanity. But at this moment the only thing anyone on earth still had was this single chair. One single chair sitting alone in a room. The last tomb to be filled by man. He sat in his chair as he tried his best to think back. He remembered something odd. Something strange about this room. He thought back. Then he remembered what it was and his mind was full of this one thing. There was a knock on the door. He stared blankly at it for a moment and called out sarcastically `` who is it?''
"," Use the minimalist and reflective style of a Zen master, focusing on simplicity and insight.","The lone figure sat in the room, a single chair his only companion. The emptiness echoed around him, reflected only by the echoes of his thoughts. A knock at the door, a stark reminder of the world once vibrant, pierced through the silence. The door swung open an inch, revealing the fallen object, a testament to the forces of destruction. The weight of the machine pressed against the door, but it budged not. Panic consumed the man, his mind searching for a way to escape the confines of the room. The chair, the only thing remaining in his possession, offered solace. As he sat, his thoughts drifted back to the memories of the room, a vivid recollection of the single chair, the only tangible remnant of life amidst the ruins. From the depths of his memory, a realization dawned upon him, a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of all things. The knock at the door echoed once more, but this time, it was met with an indifference that mirrored the silence of the room."
"`` Do you ever think about what it's like up there?'' 
 
 Her hair was spread out on the grass. The cool night air had left them both with goosebumps as Alec fidgeted, trying to find a position with his hand on hers that did n't make it seem like he was nervous. 
 
 The city was a long way away now. It was her idea, to come out here, get away from it all. He leant back, other arm propped behind his head as he looked up at the stars. 
 
 `` It's so dark,'' he said. 
 
 `` Is it?'' 
 
 She rolled onto her side. In the dim moonlight he could see nothing beyond the reflections in her eyes, but he knew she would be smiling. She loved to smile. She took her hand, leaving his despondent, and placed it over his eyes. What little light there was before vanished. 
 
 `` What do you see?'' she asked. 
 
 He could feel her breath against his ear. Warm. The breeze sent a chill through his spine a moment later. 
 
 `` Nothing.'' 
 
 She moved her hand, running it down his face until she let it rest on his chest. For one fleeting moment he was terrified she'd feel his beating heart, know his every intention and laugh at his childishness. But she just waited, letting his eyes roam. 
 
 `` Wow,'' he breathed. 
 
 The moon hung low, but the cloudless night was endless. Millions of stars floated in the heavens. The ribbon the milky way rose from above the horizon. 
 
 `` I never realised there were so many.'' 
 
 Cas sidled up closer to him. 
 
 `` I always think. There's so much up there. All you need to do is find somewhere quiet, and just look. You're never alone.'' 
 
 Alec brought her in close. 

"," Adopt the optimistic and domestic tone of a 1950s housewife, full of post-war idealism.","The evening air was cool and sweet as the stars danced above the vast expanse of the sky. Cas sat, her hair spread out on the grass, a radiant smile gracing her face. The city was a distant memory, a place of noise and strife, a far cry from the serene beauty that surrounded her now.

The moon hung low, casting long shadows across the ground. The stars glittered like diamonds, their countless number humbling her. Cas knew that the universe was vast and enigmatic, a place of infinite possibilities and awe-inspiring beauty.

In the dim moonlight, she felt her hand in his. It was a gesture of comfort, a symbol of connection and warmth. As she leaned toward him, her eyes danced with love and tenderness. His hand reached out to meet hers, and their embrace was complete.

The stars twinkled above them, reflecting the glow of Cas's smile. Her voice was soft and sweet, a melody carried on the breeze. ""I always think,"" she whispered, her words echoing through the night. ""There's so much up there. All you need to do is find somewhere quiet, and just look. You're never alone.""

As the first rays of dawn crept over the horizon, Cas watched the stars fade. The day was new, the future bright, and she knew that the best was yet to come. With a smile on her face, she leaned into Alec, her hand resting on his chest. The stars may have faded, but the memories of this night, filled with love and optimism, would forever remain etched in her heart."
"*Good thing I just finished with Fullmetal Alchemist, otherwise I would have had to look these up. * 
 
 “ So, babe, these are my friends, ” Casey said to his girlfriend, Monica. 
 
 A fat man gnawed on a chicken leg, sticking out a single greasy hand. 
 
 “ Nice to meet you, ” Bob said. “ You smell good. Reminds me of the smell of an apple for some reason. Actually, carmel apples sound pretty darn good right now. ” 
 
 Monica grabbed a napkin off the wrought-iron table and wiped her hand off. She shivered a bit, disgusted by the grease that had been on there. 
 
 She watched a man standing a far ways away, talking to some woman and acting like she wasn ’ t even there. 
 
 “ Don ’ t mind Andrew, ” Casey told her. “ He ’ s, well he ’ s a bit special. He won ’ t greet you unless you greet him first. He seriously needs to grow up. ” 
 
 “ Alright, ” Monica replied hesitantly, not really sure what to make of that. 
 
 “ I love those shoes, ” Lisa remarked, walking over to them. “ And that dress. So beautiful. ” 
 
 “ Thanks, ” Monica replied, finally not disgusted by one of his friends. That was until she ran her hands a little too seductively over Casey ’ s body. Casey, in the meantime, had a dumb smile on his face, completely ignorant of what was happening. Typical, Monica thought. Just like a man to not even realize that a woman was practically throwing herself at them. 
 
 “ Actually, we should probably take a seat over there with my other friends, ” Casey said, looking over towards the couple sitting at a table a few feet away. “ It ’ s their engagement party after all. ” 
 
 “ You ’ re going to get the bill, right? ” Bill said as Casey and Monica sat down. To Monica ’ s surprise, he was completely serious. 
 
 “ You are one cheap bastard, aren ’ t you? ” Casey replied with a wry smile. 
 
 “ He sure is, and thrifty too, ” Jenna added. “ Of course, when he sees something he wants, he wastes all of his money on it. I swear, my fiancé has zero impulse control. ” 
 
 The day went on, and Monica was enjoying herself. Bill and Jenna were a surprisingly delightful couple to hang out with. She didn ’ t particularly care for the fact that Greed sneakily swept the silverware into Jenna ’ s purse, but she overlooked it. He seemed like a nice, fun guy. 
 
 “ Did you know we used to date, ” Jenna told Monica later that night at Casey ’ s home. Casey and Bill were out on an errand. 
 
 “ You and Casey? ” Monica replied innocently. 
 
 “ Yep, ” Jenna smiled. She moved closer to Monica. Suddenly she was leaning in, her hands on Monica ’ s face, pulling her into a kiss. 
 
 Monica almost fought it. She really did. But a fire ignited in her. The thrill of getting away with such a thing, right under everyone ’ s noses at that, kept her hooked. Her lips had barely touched Jenna ’ s when the front door swung open and the guys walked in. She expected them to be irate. But they smiled and cheered. The sudden desire was gone, but now Jenna was making out with her, all to the pleasure and applause of the men standing there. 
 
 After a few seconds they stopped and the men went into the kitchen. 
 
 “ Another time, perhaps without these pesky men, ” Jenna whispered seductively. 
 
 Monica was going to tell her no, but then Bill came out and suddenly that fire, that passion for Jenna, burned in her again. She smiled a wicked smile and gave Jenna a wink. 
 
 As Casey and Monica said goodbye, walking back to Casey ’ s car, a large man ran up and hit Casey straight in the jaw. He kept hitting him. 
 
 “ Stop! ” Monica yelled, not realizing that was Ben, her exboyfriend. 
 
 “ We ’ re best friends, how could you? ” Ben yelled. 
 
 “ Sorry, I guess? ” Casey said. “ Come on, you don ’ t care that much, do you? ” 
 
 “ I just wanted to beat you up I guess, ” Ben said. 
 
 As he walked away, Monica was left speechless. In fact, she didn ’ t say anything all the way back to Casey ’ s house. He definitely had some weird friends. She still found herself thinking about Jenna, even though she would be marrying Casey in only a week. 
 
 As they walked up to the front door, a man was laid back against it, snoring. 
 
 “ Dan, wake up you lazy ass! ” Casey shouted. The man stirred, then slowly extended a hand to Monica. 
 
 “ Dan ’ s the name, ” he said. “ Sorry about being late. I guess I ’ ll get going now. ” 
 
 Dan got up and slowly staggered his way away from the house. He practically seemed drunk. 
 
 “ There ’ s one last thing, ” Casey said as they settled in bed. 
 
 “ What? ” Monica asked, thoughts of Jenna running through her mind. It took her a second to see the flames radiating from Casey ’ s side of the bed. She let out a large scream as she saw him, deformed with red skin, horns sticking out of his head. 
 
 “ Honey, ” he said in a deep, demonic voice. “ I ’ m horny. ”

"," Use the expressive and emotional style of a romantic poet, full of passion and natural imagery.","The scent of apple blossoms and the greasy aroma of chicken legs intertwine in the air, a symphony of senses orchestrated by the laughter of friends and the murmur of a romantic evening. Casey, his heart filled with affection, introduces his beloved Monica to his closest confidants, a testament to the bonds forged in the tapestry of shared experiences.

As he presents his companions, a man with a gluttonous appetite and a greasy hand, Casey's words unveil the aroma of an apple and the mouthwatering allure of caramel apples. The intricate dance of emotions unfolds as a woman's presence is met with indifference, a testament to the obliviousness of some individuals.

The intricate interplay of human interaction weaves a narrative of shared experiences and unspoken desires. With each passing moment, the bonds between friends deepen, as they engage in playful banter and share their intimate thoughts. Casey's unwavering devotion to his girlfriend is evident in his attentive gaze and his desire to ensure her comfort.

However, fate takes a cruel turn as the intrusive nature of a friend's actions brings about a moment of discomfort. The scent of apple blossoms fades as Monica's disgust consumes her, a reflection of the fleeting nature of happiness and the complexities of human behavior. Yet, in the face of adversity, she finds solace in the camaraderie of her companions, who offer support and understanding.

The evening culminates in a shared celebration, as Casey's unwavering generosity prompts him to offer to pay the bill. His jesting remark about being ""cheap"" belies the genuine warmth of his heart. As the night draws to a close, the lingering aroma of apple blossoms lingers in the air, a bittersweet memory of a night filled with joy, laughter, and shared experiences."
"Hmmm. Perhaps not the most appropriate comment for when receiving news of this nature, but it does have a rather philosophical ring to it which will build up the mood in case I get into that existential nonsense later on in this passage. Oh yes, I ’ m in a passage. How very unique, even though I say so myself. But back to the fact of the matter – I ’ m a character in a story. Might as well make myself an interesting one, while I ’ m at it. How shall I be? 
 
 Dark and brooding is a bit clichéd but still extremely cool ( especially when I wear a bowtie ). That ’ s how I shall be, then. So how do we go about this? Do I just think out stuff or does it all get written down regardless? Has everything I ’ ve thought so far been written down? I very well hope not you invasive son-of-a-bitch. I digress. 
 
 My name… Hmmm… What ’ s a badass name that fits the bill? Gussie Wilt isn ’ t going to cut it. How about something Norse… those chaps have the whole nomenclature business all sorted out. Mjolnir Odin, that sounds rather spiffing. And now my background. Rich and British. Well it does have its own charm, but I ’ m going for charm as an undertone more than as my predominant personality trait. 
 
 I have killed several men in my extensive career. Bad men. Men that killed my family. And before coming to England ( to solve the mystery of the murder of the Queen [ I have my sights on the Butler – rather suspicious chap ] ), I was in Penn. State. Or is it the other way around? Oh yes, State Pen ( itentiary ) – though one is worse than the other and I don ’ t even want to have to say which. 
 
 Oh and yes, I have a license to kill. Double-O-8, shall we say? I quite like this character business. A few more minutes and you ’ ll have a prologue…* ’ Business deal… Champagne, of Course ’ * What the devil is going on? Oye, I ’ m trying to develop a character here you uncultured twat. * ‘ No, not at all. I ’ ll get you anything you need. ’ * **Will you stop that? ** You ’ re being a pest of the first water. Now leave me alone while I concoct a bestseller. * ‘ Murder… Wine… Horses… ’ * This novel ’ s exceeding Dick Francisness is beginning to get on my nerves. * ‘ Obligatory Strip Club scene… Mobsters with curt dialogue ’ * I ’ m out. I ’ m done. I tried to cooperate but you just won ’ t help, will you? Are you making me a servant? A MAID?! A… a… butler?! Well, I suppose this means I ’ ve got the deaths of at least one family on my belt. Good enough I suppose. Take what you get.

"There it was again, the same strange IP in the world code. Ever since I learned how to access the world code and manipulate it I have learned a lot. Including the fact that every thing, from rocks to people, has a unique IP. Because of this the IP's have a very different format. Because of this I have given them a special name, WIP or World Identifying Protocol. Since everything in the universe has its own WIP the numbers are pretty long and complicated, but I learned that certain parts of the number stands for where and when it originated. So by just looking at someones WIP I can learn when and where they were born. I can also pull up their specific World Object, or WO, and learn everything about them. 
 
 The thing is since theres so many things in the universe I have had to find a way to filter out almost all the data thats streamed to my console. Pretty much only WIP affecting my immediate area show up. The thing is this the same WIP has made the same console command call, which is only possible if like me you can access the world code. But thats not even the weirdest part, from just glancing at the WIP I knew that what ever it was running those commands, had not originated from earth. The command its calling is a filter, similar to the one I use, except this one is looking very specifically for other console command calls. Its looking for me. 
 
 I've managed to backtrace the WIP without being discovered, I've been having to just look at the WO which does n't require command calls. I've learned that even though whatever it is did n't originate on earth, it certainly is here now. The WIP is currently located in NYC which kinda sucks since I dont live anywhere close to that. Anyway I am going to limit my use of the world console for now and wait until summer break, one command is all I need to convince my parents to let me take a trip to NYC and even if the foreign object finds me then I'll be well on my way to it already. 
 
 And so my journey begins I have my laptop and access to an unlimited bank account, the first thing I did with the console. What more could I need? I leave this attached to the command I ran on my parents. I expect whoever you are you have seen this. You know who I am now and I am on my way to you. See you soon... -A fellow modder.

 `` For real!? I told you guys we'd find others.'' cried Henry. 
 
 `` Yea well it sure took it long enough to find one person'' replied Charlotte.

 An hour had passed and nothing no replies no other commands nothing. Alex was just about to call it quits when some messy haired dude sat down across from him with a big ass grin on his face. `` Can I help you?'' asked Alex.

 Alright its 3 in the morning and Im really tired so Im going to go to sleep. Im pretty new to writing so and constructive criticism is appreciated. If anyone wants me to continue I will otherwise Ill just post a summary of my general idea in the morning or something, anyway good night!
", Infuse your text with the passionate and vivid imagery characteristic of Neruda's poetry.,"The cosmic tapestry, woven in the intricate language of code, unveils a secret hidden within each being - a unique identifier, a WIP, or World Identifying Protocol. As a weaver of digital threads, I have deciphered this enigmatic language and discovered that the universe whispers secrets through the intertwining of IPs.

Like a kaleidoscope reflecting the myriad hues of existence, the WIPs dance in a symphony of numbers, each one a testament to the uniqueness of a soul. Their intricate formats reveal the genesis and destiny of their owners, a cosmic map etched in digital ink.

Yet, this labyrinth of numbers is not merely a testament to the interconnectedness of all things. It is a conduit through which I have forged a connection with the ethereal realm beyond the confines of Earth. With each glimpse of a WIP, I peer into the abyss, unraveling the threads that bind the cosmos together.

In this cosmic tapestry, I have found a way to navigate the torrent of data that washes over me daily. Like a seasoned sailor, I have crafted a filter, a command that sifts through the noise, isolating only those WIPs that resonate with my immediate surroundings. This intimate connection between the WIP and the console has revealed a profound truth - the commands it issues are not born of Earth.

The WIP is a beacon, illuminating the path to a hidden realm, a foreign object that has traversed the cosmic abyss to find me. I have traced its journey, piecing together its trajectory, and discovered its current abode - New York City. Although my heart sinks at the thought of being so distant from my current home, I am determined to limit my use of the world console, for in the meantime, I have a more pressing matter at hand - convincing my parents to allow me to journey to the city of dreams.

And so, my journey begins, with a single command, a testament to my resilience and a promise of the extraordinary experiences that lie ahead."
"( lone human... themselves? I'll keep it singular for simplicity. ) 
 
 The study is posted all over the internet, and the world simply does not care. The functionality of a persons genome is beyond their daily concerns of collecting gadgets and raising their karma ( not the good kind ). However, a person of interest brings further intrigue to the whole shebackle. 
 
 This individual appears to have a completely functioning genome. Tests confirm this to be the truth, though not many people doubted it. All one needs for convincing is to lay eyes upon the grotesque figure that will burn its imagine into their minds for eternity. 
 
 The cost of a fully functional genome caused the *human* to grow a plethora of appendages, organs and develop entirely outdated traits from many previous stages of evolution. The functioning heap of genetic junk was charming to speak an outrageous lie. It was a beautiful depiction of every chaos that exists within biological creation. 
 
 Tears were shed for this poor creature and people around the world begged for its swift death, hoping to end its mostly assured pain and anguish. 
 
 But the beast doth protest! It claimed to live a full and happy life. 
 
 The masses called bullshit and wielded torch and pitchfork against the abomination. Marches organized around the home of the unfortunate one. 
 
 A sweet voice cried out to the people from below their waists. A young girl of four with eyes of green wept for the creature. 
 
 `` Do n't hurt him! He is one of us!'' 
 
 `` Nonsense!'' they spat. 
 
 `` I have what remains of a tail. My mommy says that I am special!''

 `` But I am a woman, my dear child!'' 
 
 Vomit spewed from the mouths of many and of the few remaining non-vomiters clutched themselves in terror. 
 
 `` My beauty may not be what a normal man may seek, but my spirit is refined and glorious.'' 
 
 Brows were furrowed and heads scratched. A single man placed his hand upon his hip and bellowed out. 
 
 `` Ooooh. So you think you're better than us!'' 
 
 An eruption of taunting of the foulest kind assaulted the ears of the dignity-clad creep. 
 
 `` Not at all! I simply find no worth in focusing on my physical attractiveness. My joy is in life itself.'' 
 
 Stillness gave way to the awkwardness, people began to cringe. By this time the crowd had thinned from loss of interest and a dramatic reduction in testosterone levels. A considerable mob remained clutching to their mob-things. A dramatically ugly fellow had a question brewing. 
 
 `` What happiness is there for you if you are not loved?'' 
 
 `` On the contrary, I am loved deeply. My husband is inside. You should meet him.'' 
 
 She slithered back into her home for a moment, emerging afterwards with an accompanying member. A gentleman walked out of the home, hand in hand with the wretched pustule. Breaths escaped and eyes beheld a man of considerable beauty. 
 
 `` What the hell? How could you be with such a ghastly woman?'' a leading voice rang out with jealousy. 
 
 The man did not respond, could not respond. The hideous wretch explained. 
 
 `` He has no sight, no hearing, or voice to speak of. But with me he can smile.'' 
 
 The last of the weapons and fires dropped and dowsed. The mob had thrown in the towel and wiped their mouths clean and dried their eyes. They had all witnessed true beauty. The instance had overwhelmed the hearts of many that day. Some determined themselves to change for the better and pursue life with a new perspective. Others had made amends with those they had wronged beforehand. 
 
 However, this sentimentality did not last and the very next day every single person returned to lives of greed and debauchery with incredible enthusiasm. After all, these were the true workings of evolution. 
 

"," Use the precise and excited tone of an enthusiastic scientist, including technical jargon.","The study, detailing the functional genome of a lone human, remains largely ignored by the global populace. However, a person of particular interest brings further intrigue to the complex subject. This individual, blessed with a fully functional genome, exhibits a grotesque physical morphology that serves as a testament to the chaotic nature of biological creation.

The sheer cost of possessing a fully functional genome has resulted in an array of anomalous physical traits, including extraneous appendages, unnecessary organs, and outdated evolutionary features. While the grotesque figure may elicit disgust, it is undeniable that the presence of such a marvel of genetic engineering evokes a sense of awe and wonder.

Tears flowed freely for the poor creature, and people worldwide pleaded for its swift demise. However, the beast protested, claiming to live a fulfilling life. The masses, fueled by anger and desperation, unleashed their wrath in the form of torch and pitchfork. Marches coalesced around the unfortunate individual's home, their voices echoing through the night.

A young girl, her eyes shining with empathy, emerged from the crowd. Her voice, soft yet unwavering, pleaded with the masses to reconsider their actions. ``Do n't hurt him, he is one of us,'' she pleaded. But her pleas fell on deaf ears. The red-eyed crowd, consumed by their anger, disregarded the girl's pleas and resumed their assault.

As the door to the monster's domain swung open, the beast emerged, its voice dripping with desperation. ``But I am a woman, my dear child,'' it cried. The crowd erupted into a chorus of vomit and terror. The creature's final words, ``My beauty,'' echoed through the air, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of all witnesses."
"At the moment, I'm just working on writing two separate projects ( I flip flop between the two because I am fickle minded ) and just seeing where they take me. I have n't been writing for myself for long ( Mostly when I do write it is/was for school ) so I have had these on the go for a long time and start-stop a lot, which also means they have n't progressed much.

"`` God damn it.... 
 This is the worst.'' 
 
 Dracula stood there in front of the automatic paper towel dispenser with a hint of hopelessness in his eyes. 
 He turned back to look at the hallway behind him, lined with bathroom stalls. 
 Only one was closed. 
 Great. 
 He looked back at the dispenser with a lips-curled-in-grim smile on his face. His hands were still dripping with water. He knew he had to wait. 
 
 `` Of course there'd be no hand dryer. But???'' 
 
 He scoffed. 
 
 `` There's always a damn hand dryer. What is happening to the world?!'' 
 
 The sound of a flushing toilet interrupted his complaints. 
 His head jolted up in relief. 
 He looked back down to see a small puddle in front of his feet. He felt a little frantic as he tried kicking the water toward the wall. 
 Finally the door swung open as a young man exited. 
 Dracula stopped kicking immediately and awaited eagerly for help. 
 
 He looked back as the man walked toward him and flashed a friendly smile. The man nodded to him and then proceeded to the door. 
 
 Dracula's eyes widened, fearing what he thought was happening was actually happening. 
 
 `` UH HEY!'' Dracula blurted out right as the man approached the door. 
 
 The man stopped and looked at him. 
 
 `` Are n't you going to wash your hands..?'' Dracula stuttered. 
 
 The man's eyebrows lowered as he glared at Dracula. 
 `` How about you mind your own business buddy. I do n't judge you for creepily standing in front of the towel dispenser.'' And then he reached for the door. 
 
 `` But dude!'' He blurted again. 
 `` You totally just took a dump in there. Do n't you think about all the poop particles that are probably all over your hands??'' 
 
 The man rolled his eyes. 
 `` Whatever dude.'' 
 He reached for the door again. 
 
 `` OKAY WAIT'' Dracula could n't hide the desperation in his voice. 
 `` I actually need your help.'' 
 
 The man's eyes were judgy as he scanned Dracula up and down, and then back down to the water on the floor. And then Dracula's hands. It all made sense now. 
 
 `` Let me guess.'' The man began. 
 `` You're a vampire. And you ca n't dry your hands because the sensors do n't read your hands.'' 
 
 Dracula shrugged and let out a nervous laugh. 
 
 `` Well then.'' The man stood there for a second, thinking. Then he took a few steps toward Dracula. Dracula's body naturally huddled around itself feeling uncomfortable about his personal space bubble being threatened. He was nervous. 
 
 The man's eyes twinkled with a devious proposal brewing. 
 
 `` For being such a tool about me not washing my hands. I give you this offer.'' The man's teeth shined bright as his smile grew larger. 
 
 Dracula's stomach sank. 
 
 `` I will swipe my hand under the sensor, and help you dry your hands. IF. And only if. 
 You..... 
 
 
 Lick. 
 
 
 My. 
 Hand.'' 
 
 The horror that struck Dracula was overwhelming as he lowered his eyes to the very hands this man spoke of. 
 
 The silence was filled with a laugh more disgusting than the look of this man's poopie hands as Dracula's eyes went back and forth between the hands and the puddle on the floor. 
 
 `` Why the fuck is there no hand dryer..'' 

"," Write with the elegance and wit of a Regency-era novelist, full of social intrigue and romance.","The scene unfolded in the common restroom, a testament to the unexpected encounters that could transpire within the confines of a Regency-era establishment. Dracula, a man of refined taste and unwavering determination, stood amidst the olfactory and auditory symphony of a shared bathroom. His frustration mounted as he surveyed the desolate landscape of empty stalls and the absence of a hand dryer. The gods conspired against him, and he vented his displeasure with a sarcastic remark, ""God damn it.... This is the worst.""

The sound of a flushing toilet echoed through the halls, and Dracula's heart skipped a beat. He looked down to see a small puddle in front of his feet, the result of a previous occupant's indiscretion. Panic surged through him as he frantically kicked water toward the wall, his temper flaring. Finally, the door swung open, and a young man emerged, his footsteps leading him directly to Dracula.

The young man's eyes met Dracula's, and a sense of dread filled his heart. He knew that this encounter was destined to be memorable. As the man approached the door, Dracula's fears materialized. He blurted out, ""UH HEY!"" but his pleas for assistance fell on deaf ears. The man's eyes narrowed in disapproval, and he sneered, ""How about you mind your own business buddy. I do n't judge you for creepily standing in front of the towel dispenser.""

As the door swung shut, Dracula stood alone, his humiliation palpable. The young man's parting words echoed in his mind, ""Whatever dude."" A feeling of despair washed over him. The encounter had not only been humiliating but also deeply unsettling. He felt as if the world had conspired against him, and he was the only victim.

In this Regency-era restroom, a tale unfolded, filled with social intrigue and a dash of humor. Through the eyes of Dracula, we witness the absurdity of human behavior and the unexpected encounters that can occur in the most mundane of places."
"Major Tycho Novak laughed at the words, his artificial eyes glowing brightly in the dim light of the officers' lounge. 
 
 `` Kid, there's exactly two kinds of peace; the temporary and the permanent. The Temporary is the more common one. The two sides get tired of killing and sign a peace treaty promising not to attack and to stay on their side of the fence. Those never last. Humans are bastards and as soon as their side is rested and resupplied, after they have had a generation or two to recoup their losses they strike. They fight, they kill, they die all over again until once more they either succeed in their objectives or more likely get tired of throwing their sons and daughters into the grinder. So they declare peace *again, * using that quiet period of time to rest and rearm. And then, the other side attacks to recapture lost territory from the last war. Sensing a pattern? 
 
 `` Now the permanent peace, that is the one where you wipe your foe clean off the map. Carthage, Nazi Germany, the Amaris Empire. They wo n't be troubling us anymore. We did more than defeat them, we crushed them utterly, their remains found only in the history books. You must be willingly to break a culture completely if you want them never to threaten you again. You demolish their temples, burn their libraries with their caretakers inside. Slaughter their religious leaders wherever they're found. Teach them your language, your faith and raise their children from birth to be like you and not like their grandparents.'' 
 
 `` But that's... that's cultural genocide.'' 
 
 Novak nodded, idly brushing a thumb over his black collar tab with its three silver pips. 
 
 `` It is. It's terrible and wrong. And that is why we will always have war. There is no one willing to take that ultimate step, to become irredeemable in the eyes of mankind and god. Perhaps that was why Lucifer fell from Heaven, to save man from the curse God Himself placed on them. He was willing to be cast away from the light of God to suffer for the Sins of Man.'' 
 
 `` You mean like Christ?'' 
 
 Major Novak smiled ruefully, taking a sip of his beer. 
 
 `` Now there's an interesting thought...'' 
 

"," Style the text after a Victorian detective story, including intricate plots, deductive reasoning, and a foggy London setting.","Major Tycho Novak sat in the dim light of the officers' lounge, his artificial eyes glowing brightly. A fog shrouded London, casting long, eerie shadows across the streets. The scent of coal smoke and damp earth filled the air, a testament to the city's industrial heart.

Noak's voice echoed through the room, his words sharp as a razor. ""There are only two kinds of peace, my dear boy,"" he declared. ""The temporary and the permanent.""

The temporary peace, he explained, was like a treaty between warring factions. It was a façade, a lull before the storm. Humans were inherently violent, and once they had rested and rearm, they would strike again.

The permanent peace, on the other hand, was a ruthless one. It was the annihilation of an enemy, the wiping of their existence from the face of the earth. Carthage, Nazi Germany, the Amaris Empire – they were all victims of this ultimate solution.

""But that's... that's cultural genocide,"" a voice piped up.

Noak nodded, his black collar tab gleaming with its three silver pips. ""It is, I admit. It's terrible and wrong. And that is why we will always have war. There is no one willing to take that ultimate step, to become irredeemable in the eyes of mankind and God.""

As the fog crept closer, swallowing the city in its embrace, Novak stood up, his gaze sweeping across the misty landscape. He knew that the path to peace was long and treacherous, and that the human capacity for violence was boundless."
"The young man looked around, as he sat in his small airship. He finally saved up enough to get one. Although, it was really more of a hot air balloon with a couple of steam powered fans and a rudder to help steer. No longer would he have to rent one from that dirty scoundrel Lazirith. He would finally be able to harvest clouds for only himself, and would n't have to share half of his earnings with Lazirith. Today he would make a name for himself as the best cloud harvester ever, and maybe if he did a good job for the Wizard, he might teach him some tricks to use in a pinch. Besides pirates, you had to worry about dragons, birds larger than some airships, and the Hawkari, a humanoid winged creature with black skin, sharp talons, a beak and nasty magic. They stuck to the Nimbostratus clouds for the dark storm magic. So avoiding them was n't normally an issue. In the two years he had been collecting clouds Jaxson had never seen a Hawkari. He made a last check that he had his cloud trappers, harpoon gun, pack and enough fuel to last him and he launched. 
 
 Jaxson got up to the Stratocumulus cloud level. From here Jaxson could see the entire world. Everything looked fake from this perspective. The trees and village he could make out looked like children's toys. The tilled fields like small checker boards of green and brown. The Strato clouds were good for quick money as most mages, witches, and wizards used the elements from the clouds in a majority of their spells. 
 
 Jaxson prepared his first cloud trapper as he was about to enter the cloud. He grabbed the bronze latch at the top of the glass container and twisted it a quarter turn, until it popped open, with the release of pressure. He did n't know how the Magesmiths make these but he had managed to buy five of them over the past two years. Not an easy thing when they cost half a gold each, but now he was able to collect a lot of clouds in one run. He positioned the bottle in the holder on the side of his basket. As soon as it was placed in the basket, once invisible runes on the side of the glass began to glow turquoise. To Jaxson they were scribbles, but he new that once in the basket, the basket runes activated the cloud catching runes and began to suck in the clouds. After about five minutes Jaxson seals the lid back on the bottle, and gives the latch a quarter turn to close it. He always wondered how the clouds could be so big then shrink so small but look the same as when they were big. Jaxson rummaged through his pack to pull out some bread and cheese to eat. As he sat chewing the day old stale bread and hard cheese he heard a screech. 
 
 `` Fuck'n hell. What was that?'' Jaxson said to himself as he peeked over the side of the basket. In the sky, barreling his way looked to be a baby dragon, being chased by a Hawkari. He reached down and grabbed his harpoon gun, lifted it up and took aim at the Hawkari. Jaxson knew the dragon at such a young age was far more manageable than the Hawkari. The harpoon left the gun as Jaxson got the Hawkari in the sights. The Hawkari noticed the harpoon at the last second and shot off a quick lightning spell to stop it. It missed and hit my basket. The harpoon struck through the Hawkari's chest, pinning one of its wings back. It instantly dropped out of the sky, spiraling until Jaxson could no longer see it clearly. He would need to get a new harpoon now but at least he did n't die today. 
 
 The beating of wings growing closer, snapped him back to the moment. He just realized the dragon was flapping its wings outside of the basket. Jaxson peeks over the edge of the basket, into the bright blue eyes of a baby dragon. The dragon was green, he knew this was a earth dragon but all dragons had the ability to fly. They stared at each other for a minute as Jaxson slowly pulled off a chunk of bread and threw it to the dragon. The dragon dove into the basket before Jaxson could do anything. Not that there was much he could do to stop something as large as a wolf. Luckily, he was only a baby. It snuggled up against Jaxson and he slowly lowered his hand, and began stroking the babies head. He went to pat his stomach but the dragon snapped up and barred his teeth. 
 
 `` Hold on, Hold on. Its okay I did n't mean to hurt you.'' Jaxson said as he raised his hands up in defense. The dragon put its head back into Jaxson's lap. Jaxson caught sight of a gash in the side of the dragon just below his right wing. He slowly lifted the wing up, noticing the gash was more than he could mend himself. Jaxson made the decision to bring the dragon to the Wizard to see if he could help the young dragon. He could drop off the cloud he picked up while he was at it. 
 
 `` Well little dragon. Lets see if we can get you all fixed up.'' Jaxson looked at the horizon and the ground as they started their descent.
", Write in the introspective and flowing stream of consciousness style characteristic of Virginia Woolf.,"The young man sat in his small airship, a canvas skin stretched tight over inflated rubber, the engine sputtering like a trapped bird. His savings, painstakingly accumulated over months, had finally yielded him this contraption, a hot air balloon with the grit of steam and the grace of a rudder. No longer would he be beholden to the conniving Laurith, his earnings pilfered like bread from a hungry mouth. Today, he would carve his name in the annals of cloud harvesting, the envy of wizards and the bane of pirates.

A symphony of thoughts danced within his mind, the river of consciousness flowing like the clouds he sought. The Hawkari, creatures of myth and menace, clung to the Nimbostratus clouds, their obsidian skin and wicked claws glinting like swords. Yet, he had never encountered them, a testament to his fortune. The Strato clouds, wisps of celestial smoke, offered quick riches, their power harnessed by mages, witches, and wizards alike.

With meticulous preparation, Jaxson ascended to the Stratocumulus cloud level, his airship buoyant as a feather on the wind. The world below unfolded beneath him, a tapestry woven from illusion and reality. The trees danced like puppets, the villages resembled miniature toys, and the fields stretched below like checkered boards of emerald and gold. He felt an inexplicable connection to this vastness, a sense of insignificance amidst the cosmic dance of creation.

As he prepared to enter the cloud, he reached for his trusty cloud trapper, a contraption of glass and bronze, his mind grappling with the intricate mechanisms employed by the Magesmiths. With a quarter turn of a latch, the container erupted, releasing the pent-up pressure like a sigh of relief. The bottle, nestled securely in its holder, glowed with anticipation, promising a bounty of cloud treasures.

In this moment of triumph, the young man stood tall, his airship soaring through the sky, his spirit unbound. He was a master of his own destiny, a weaver of dreams, and a testament to the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the confines of convention."
"My name is Dave, and I just did n't believe. I did n't really have a reason to believe or not believe. Then, one day, I stepped in front of a bus, and I woke up at the pearly gates. Everyone seemed so pissed off, some mumbling and others screaming. There must have been millions of people waiting outside, so many of them praying with unshakable faith. That's when I knew I was screwed. I'd chosen wrong and lived my life accordingly. I was reluctant to get in line, but someone waved me over. I thought I was going to hell for sure, but St. Peter opened the gates to the screams and derision of so many. 
 
 I went in and saw others like me, just hanging out. I asked what I was supposed to do. They collectively pointed me to a large building. It was obvious really. I kind of felt dumb in those first few minutes. I mean, really, what was I thinking. Well, I was thinking, what the hell am I doing here? People waved at me and shouted, but I kept going. 
 
 There had to be some trick or some mistake. I was brought before a council of men and women. I did n't know what to say, but they spoke first. 
 
 `` Welcome, do you have any questions?'' 
 
 `` Umm, like a million.'' 
 
 `` Well, we do n't have all millennium.'' 
 
 `` Is this heaven?'' 
 
 `` You bet your ass it is.'' 
 
 `` Why was I accepted but all of those others were n't?'' 
 
 `` You're an atheist. Only atheists are allowed entry into heaven.'' 
 
 `` Why? It does n't matter how good of a person I was?'' 
 
 `` Why? Almost no one asks why. Well, it's because you do n't believe in those other false gods like the rest of those idiots who keep praying to them. You did what you wanted with your life, not hiding behind some god or book or whatever.'' 
 
 `` But they're good people. Some of them must be.'' 
 
 `` I suppose they are, but they're also prudes who do n't like doing all of the weird sex stuff.'' 
 
 `` Wait, what?'' 
 
 `` It's not important right now. It's just a condition that you consented to when you entered here.'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Stop saying what?'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Say what again. We dare you.'' 
 
 `` Uhhh, so uhh, wait, uhhh, no.'' 
 
 `` At least you non-believers never mention those other false gods in the throws of passion.'' 
 
 `` So, I'm a sex slave now? That sounds awful.'' 
 
 `` And it's terrible.'' 
 
 `` Oh Go-'' 
 
 `` Do n't you dare! Do n't say his name, or you'll get to meet Lucy first hand. Trust us, we're sweethearts compared to her.'' 
 
 `` So, what exactly is this place?'' 
 
 `` Come on, Dave, it's an interdimensional SBDM resort to service all sorts of beings. You'll be freed eventually.'' 
 
 The being throws a ball gag at his feet. 
 
 `` Put this on for now, Dave. We do n't want you blurting out that name again.'' 
 
 I turn away from them and smile. This is definitely my idea of heaven.
"," Adopt the gritty, laconic style of a noir detective, with a dark, atmospheric tone.","My name is Dave, and I just did n't believe in a higher power. Not that I had a particular reason to believe or not believe, but fate had a different script in mind for me that day. As I stepped onto the bus, fate took a cruel turn and plunged me into a dream-like state. When I woke up, the pearly gates of heaven were in front of me. The air was thick with the screams and prayers of countless souls, each one clinging to their own personal beliefs. It was clear to me that I was fated to be an outcast, a traveler through this celestial realm.

I was reluctant to join the throngs of believers, but fate had a different plan for me. I was ushered into a large building, surrounded by others like me, all hanging out. I felt a sense of shame and bewilderment. What was I doing here? I asked the question to the assembled crowd, but they dismissed me with a collective sigh. It was as if I had spoken to a wall.

Finally, I was brought before a council of men and women. Their voices were like the sirens' song, sweet yet treacherous. They welcomed me, but their words held a bitter truth. I was an atheist, and according to their divine decree, that meant I was barred from paradise. They claimed I had lived my life according to my own whims, without the guidance of a higher power. I argued that my deeds were not necessarily nefarious, but they were dismissed.

In the end, I was left to grapple with my fate. I felt as if I had been punished for living a life that was not in accordance with their beliefs. The people in heaven may have been good, but they were also prudes who did not approve of all of the ""weird sex stuff."" It was a cruel joke, I thought, one that I had no hope of understanding."

 It wasn ’ t always like this. There was a time when I was able to dress up and walk around the neighborhood, pillowcase in tow, collecting as much candy as I could before my curfew. 
 
 
 Yes, there was a time when Halloween was *fun*. 
 
 
 After a time, candy collecting evolved to going to house parties, getting drunk, getting laid, having a good time, and either passing out somewhere on the floor there or stumbling home, blissfully unaware of any deep, dark, danger, only afraid of flashing lights, blue uniforms, and shiny badges. 
 
 
 But now? Now it ’ s different. Now Halloween has become something of a phobia for me. Now I hug the corners tight, always facing outwards, eyes wide alert for any sudden movement around me. When I see cops I walk towards them gratefully, breathing short sighs of relief. Light too. I plan my walks to that they go down the most lighted streets. I jump from beam to beam like an insane person. And maybe I am. But I ’ ve seen it…and you would be too.

 Look, I know how this sounds, but bear with me. I didn ’ t believe Paul either when he told me. I remember thinking he was just too fuckin ’ high. I mean, you know Paul. He did that sometimes. I thought he was too high and played too much Dark Souls. 
 
 
 He came up to me at Steph ’ s party and pushed me aside, that wild, paranoid look in his red, red eyes. He was terrified. I tried to laugh and shrug him off. He reeked. His breath reeked. But he pushed me back and whispered about this…*thing* to me, this evil, stalking *thing*. 
 
 
 And I was like, “ Whoa, dude, calm the fuck down. What are you even talking about? You stuck in Dark Souls again? ” 
 
 
 He pushed my face back. His hands goddamn stank of pussy or dick or, I don ’ t know, shit. 
 
 
 At this point, I was annoyed as hell. He was starting to make a scene. 
 
 
 He said to me, he said, “ Luce. Lucy. Promise me. Promise me that you ’ ll take The Thing. Promise me that you ’ ll take it away from me. ” 
 
 
 I cringed, shoving him away. His breath was literal death. Like he ate a rotting corpse inside and out and then licked the corpse of a skunk in his morbid excitement. 
 
 
 And I said to him, I said, “ Yeah, sure, man, whatever. Just get off of me…and take a fucking bath. ” 
 
 
 Never saw him again after that. Well, I did, once, across campus, but I can ’ t be sure it was him. 
 
 
 That was the Last Fun Halloween. Every October after that some *thing* stalked me. It came out in peeks and pips here and there at the start of the month, but the closer it got to the dreaded day it didn ’ t even try to hide and would follow me openly, whispering shadowy secrets in my ear. 
 
 
 I tried to ignore it, shake it off as some weird figment of my subconscious, drown it out with music and Netflix, and I was able to, for a while. But, last Halloween, it grew comfortable with me, too comfortable. 
 
 
 I was sitting there, trying to concentrate on the next episode of the show I was watching, totally alone in my locked and bolted apartment on the third floor of the Towers, when, quite quickly, it waltzed in from my bedroom, literally waltzed, and sat cross legged against the wall across from me, arms crossed, hat in claw. And it began to talk…and talk…and whisper mad, violent things in a deep guttural voice. Its infinitely black eyes bored into my skull creating a penetrating dull buzzing that drove me mad until I could actually feel my teeth grinding to dust. 
 
 
 I began by throwing my remote at it, then my controller, then my phone, and laptop, and lamp. And each time this…*thing* caught what was thrown deftly and laugh and place the object next to it until it had built up a good sized pile. 
 
 
 The cops soon came and I thanked them and pleaded with them and they looked over my shoulder to my broken things all stacked up neat and high and took me away into their protection that night. 
 
 
 It, of course, followed me, tapping the window of the police car with a long, yellow nail as it ran on many, many legs outside on the street. 
 
 
 That night it sat in the corner of the cell laughing and laughing until I drown it out with a pillow on my head. In the morning it was gone. 
 
 
 After that Halloween I knew. Knew that Paul wasn ’ t lying, wasn ’ t crazy. That there was some…magic in this. Some weird, witchy magic that allows this curse, this *thing*, to be passed from one person to the next in tale, in story, in legend. 
 
 
 I know how I sound. I know how *this* sounds. But bear with me. I think we can destroy it. For the past year I ’ ve been working on this…thing... that will allow me, us, to destroy it. It ’ ll come out soon, and I want you to be prepared. 
 
 
 Don ’ t listen to it. Don ’ t look at it. 
 
 
 And wait for me at 3AM—Witching Hour—on the third bridge across the creek. Do n't forget. Don ’ t be late.

He came up to me at Steph’s party and pushed me aside, that wild, paranoid look in his red, red eyes. He was terrified. I tried to laugh and shrug him off. He reeked. His breath reeked. But he pushed me back and whispered about this…*thing* to me, this evil, stalking *thing*.

And I was like, “Whoa, dude, calm the fuck down. What are you even talking about? You stuck in Dark Souls again? ”

He pushed my face back. His hands goddamn stank of pussy or dick or, I don’t know, shit.

At this point, I was annoyed as hell. He was starting to make a scene.

He said to me, he said, “Luce. Lucy. Promise me. Promise me I won’t die on Halloween.”"
"`` Tweet!'' 
 A Cardinal jumped side to side while staring into his enemies eyes, *the squirrel*. That fucker had been stealing from the Cardinal's bird feeder for years, but the Cardinal could n't do anything until now. He had found something to combat the fucking squirrel. Some little plastic case which had been surrounded by dead ants. Obviously it was some kind of poison. So the Cardinal dumped the plastic container's contents into the bird feeder, and the squirrel happily, and unknowingly, forged himself on poison. 
 The squirrel's eyes went empty, then the little bastard fell off the tree branch to the ground, dead. 
 `` Jerry!'' Exclaimed the Squirrel's squirrel friend. 
 `` Jerry, speak to me!'' 
 `` He's dead, Frank.'' Replied the Cardinal. `` This is why you do n't eat *my* goddamned food, *rodent scum*'' 
 Frank quaked in terror and ran off to notify the other squirrels. The Cardinal was n't the victim anymore, the tables had turned. 
 
 Sara watched a little squirrel run around squeaking to their fellow squirrels while running around the tree. `` Is n't that so cute! They're playing!''
"," Write in Shakespeare's rich and expressive language, utilizing iambic pentameter and Elizabethan English.","``A Tweet!'' A Cardinal, with eyes aglow,
Staring at his adversary, the sly squirrel,
With a heart filled with a fiery glow,
A battle waged, a tale to be told.

The squirrel, a predator, had wrought its crime,
Stealing from the Cardinal's bird feeder,
But the tide turned, and the tables flipped,
For the Cardinal, with cunning slick.

A plastic container, filled with poison's brew,
Was cunningly placed in the feeder's heart,
The squirrel, unsuspecting, took a bite,
And met its demise with a bitter plight.

The eyes of the squirrel went vacant and cold,
And down it fell, a victim to its own fold.
The Cardinal stood tall, his spirit bold,
And with a smile, he uttered this word:

""Is not this sweet, to see them dance and play,
These creatures of the woods, so full of sway?"""
"Look, if you're going to cut down an alley in this part of town dressed like that, I consider it a personal favor that someone as non-violent as myself is going to teach you this life lesson. I launch into Act 1 of our little two-man show, and I have to say that Mr. Fancy really shone in his role as set-upon victim; I did n't have to put up with any tough-guy bullshit, but he was n't some blubbering, pants-wetting mess that I had to coach through the whole process either. You can tell this guy's been mugged before, and he has that polite, detached let's-conclude-this-transaction-quickly demeanor that I really appreciate in a mark. I think to myself that everything's going ol' Lucky's way if a man who's in this tight with my boy Benjamin Franklin decided he did n't have the patience to wait for that Uber like everyone else. I'm about to wrap things up, but his hand is lingering a little protectively around that right pocket and my intuition starts nagging me that maybe we're operating with different understandings of the word `` empty''. Now you do n't need to explain to me about honor among thieves, but it does rustle my jimmies a mite when I'm doing my level best to keep this a polite and professional experience and the mark thinks he's going to get clever on me. I present a convincing argument as to the merits of my empty pockets policy to Mr. Fancy in the form of a few right crosses, and he hands me a thumb drive. If he's willing to buy tickets to my chin music festival for it, I'm thinking its probably got some financials on it, or maybe a performance art piece he did with the missus. Either way, you bet your ass I'm checking it out. I leave him zip-tied to the dumpster like usual and stroll back home to count my money per the sage advice of the warrior poet Kenny Rogers. 
 
 Back home I say hello to Roachy and the boys as they skitter under the fridge, and I review my haul on the kitchen counter with the assistance of a cold can of Nasty Light. It'll keep the lights on anyway, maybe with a little left over to sock away in my equine investment portfolio down at the track. I figure I'll check the thumb drive to see if I maybe hit the Powerball, so I pop it in the ol' porn box and load the drive. One measly.exe file, and I've opened too many of those from Russian models who want much sexytime to fall for that again. A little disappointed, I toss it and turn my thoughts to how I'm going to convince Snake tomorrow that this Rolex is a no-shitter. 
 
 I flip on the TV and some fine-ass blonde is perched above the scroller talking about terrorism, and I'm just about to flip it over to Cartoon Network when what do I see but some security camera footage of me and Mr. Fancy having our little tete-a-tete. Shit. He must have been some kind of something if taking his lunch money is worth throwing my mug up on cable news. I develop a sudden interest in national security, and turn up the volume. Apparently Mr. Fancy was some Chinese agent moonlighting as a Pentagon IT muckety-muck who was on his way to take down the nation's energy grid with his trusty thumb drive. The talking heads are on the screen now speculating wildly as to the identity of this masked hero and the current whereabouts of the thumb drive. I cast a nervous glance at the trash can, but as of now it appears that the only one with any pressing interest in it is Roachy.

 The CIA denies involvement, but of course that's what they'd say, so everybody -- to include the CIA -- seems to be content with the narrative that they cracked this one and everything's under control. Soon the nation moves on after an escaped gorilla is shot by a Syrian immigrant cop at a Black Lives Matter rally. Me, I'm still just a small-time hustler running game. You're welcome, America.
"," Rewrite this as if it were a monologue from a Shakespeare play, using Elizabethan language and iambic pentameter.","O noble patron of this humble town, behold me,
A humble warrior armed with wisdom's sway,
In this theater of life, I take the stage
To teach you, my dear, a valuable gauge.

Behold Act I, where Mr. Fancy met
With misfortune, a fate most cruel,
For the gods have woven their wicked web,
And cast upon him, a burden steep.

With patience and grace, I guide the mark,
Through this labyrinth of petty strife,
For I believe that through this strife,
A valuable lesson can be rife.

My friend, you may question honor's sway,
But I assure you, it does not rustle me,
For I have honed my empty pockets art,
And with a single hand, I play the part.

In this act of deception, I take delight,
And leave the mark in his own plight,
Yet I am mindful of the warrior's plight,
And bid farewell, with a cold, sly light."

''It's not buddy, relax. Time will pass, it will go away'' I knew my words mea n't nothing but I had to pretend they did. 
 
''It wo n't go away! Not something like this!'' He said while still punching. He must of had a few broken knuckles by now.

"," Write with the adventurous and optimistic tone of a retro sci-fi hero, battling aliens and saving worlds.","In the face of adversity, I stand tall, a beacon of hope amidst the cosmic storm. As I gaze upon the destruction wrought by the alien scourge, I am not consumed by despair, but rather, a determination to save my beloved world. With each punch I throw against the wall, I find solace in the belief that time is a fleeting illusion, and that even in the darkest of times, the human spirit can triumph.

The events that unfolded that fateful day were a testament to the interconnectedness of our universe. It was as if the cosmos conspired against me, shattering the tranquility of my locker room, and replacing it with a symphony of chaos. The broomstick, a symbol of the cruelty that humans can inflict upon one another, pierced through my friend's flesh, leaving an indelible mark on his spirit.

But I refuse to be a victim to this injustice. I know that the road to recovery will be long and arduous, but I believe in the power of empathy and compassion. As I witness the resilience of my friend, I am inspired to continue my fight against the forces of darkness.

In this cosmic battle, I am more than just a hero. I am a symbol of hope, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit. Together, we can overcome even the most formidable obstacles, and create a world where every individual has the opportunity to live a fulfilling life."

 Fade in to a mound of swords, tips facing us. We hear footsteps on stone, slowly getting closer. Meanwhile, the camera zooms out until we recognize this as The Iron Throne. Camera sweeps around the throne, until we are in front of middle-aged DAENARYS sitting on the throne, face blank. 
 
 After several seconds, in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester's chain. Both sounds then stop, and we hear an aged but familiar voice, `` Your Grace...'' 
 
 The camera turns to face SAM, in full maester garb. We see him approaching the camera for a few seconds, and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs. DAENARYS nods and SAM climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops. 
 
 Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head. To her right stands SIR JORAH, after all these years, he's still protectively looking over her. The Hand of the King's medallion hangs from his armor. 
 
 SAM: I've just received word from The Wall. It's still holding, but they do n't think it'll hold much longer. Attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice. 
 
 DAENARYS: What do you advise, Grand Meister? Can we do anything? 
 
 SAM: Not yet, but I've heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known. I was reluctant to seek it out because it involves... 
 
 A look of extreme discomfort crosses his face, almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words. 
 
 SAM:... blood magic. 
 
 DAENARYS: As protector of the realm, I must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of White Walkers. You must seek the RED WOMAN at once, perhaps she knows of this text. 
 
 JORAH, disapprovingly: Khaleesi... 
 
 DAENARYS: I hope to not need it. But if the wall may be breached, we must be prepared. In the meantime, my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone, and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements. And Jorah, you must stop calling me that. I am... 
 
 She stands, the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background, growing louder until the end of her sentence. 
 
 DAENARYS, thundering: Daenarys Stormborn of House Targaryn, Queen of The Seven Kingdoms, Grandmother of Dragons and Protector of the Realm. 
 
 Still facing her, we hear 
 
 JORAH and SAM ( in unison ): Yes, my queen. 
 
 Fade into the next scene.

 We see a green, lush, almost idyllic island at dusk. The sea is an unusually bright blue, which would be concerning if we did n't remember it as its namesake, The Sapphire Isle. This is Tarth. 
 
 The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach. A woman stands in front of them, a sword fighting teacher. The camera continues upwards. We see a small castle, with a balcony over the field. Two figures sit on the balcony, indistinguishable. The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand. 
 
 Cut to a closeup of JAMIE and BRIENNE watching the children below. They are both old, in their fifties. We can still make out JAMIE's unadulterated good looks, and BRIENNE still... not so much. But she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment's notice. They occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over-exuberantly feigns injury. 
 
 We hear in the distance, and from JAMIE and BRIENNE's perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind. 
 
 ARYA: Alright, that's it for today. And remember, what do we say to Death? 
 
 CHILDREN ( in unison ): NOT TODAY! 
 
 The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements. 
 
 ARYA: Now inside, it's getting dark. 
 
 The children drop their swords and run to the castle. ARYA sighs and collects the swords. She walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed. Through the window, we see Needle, framed and mounted on her office wall. How did she end up here, doing this? She would never know. 
 
 Fade to next scene.

 I had to stop here today, but I have an idea for the storyline which I'd like to write if anyone's interested in me continuing.
"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","The scene which unfolded before my eyes, though nascent in its progression, carried the promise of a narrative woven with the deft hand of a master storyteller. The imagery painted by the flickering screen danced with the echoes of the footsteps and the jangle of a maester's chain, creating a symphony of anticipation and suspense.

The throne, a symbol of power and authority, stood tall amidst the grand halls of Winterfell. The middle-aged Daenerys Targaryen, adorned in silks and draped in mystery, sat upon its cold embrace. Her stoic face, devoid of any semblance of joy or passion, reflected the weight of the world upon her shoulders.

The arrival of Sam Tarly, the revered Maester, heralded a message from the Wall. The icy fortress, once a beacon of protection against the encroaching darkness, was holding its ground, but the attacks from the White Walkers were growing in frequency and intensity. The scorching summer sun relentlessly melted the icy barriers, threatening to consume the world in an abyss of doom.

Sam's words, laced with caution and urgency, painted a grim picture of the future. The ancient text, shrouded in secrecy and wielding unimaginable power, was the only hope for salvation. However, the cost of wielding such power was exorbitant, a burden too great for even the mightiest of hearts to bear.

Despite the daunting obstacles and the potential consequences, Daenerys's unwavering resolve burned bright within her. As protector of the realm, she knew that she must do everything in her power to defend her kingdom against the army of White Walkers. The burden of her position weighed heavily upon her, but she met it with grace and determination, a testament to the enduring spirit of those who stand guard against the encroaching darkness."
"In no way was he broadsided by the words that left her lips. He looks through the floor, to the depths of his soul. He finds only pieces and dust. His gazed is locked, he notices she is still talking, watching him look at the floor. 
 
 The ringing in his ears start tapering off, she has already stood up and grabbed her purse. She is talking, watching the man that dares not make a move. His face wet with tears, his hearing snaps back, just as she leans in to kiss him one last time. 
 
 `` We've still got time. Not enough, but enough.'' 
 
 She turns, and as he hears the *click* of the door, the man breaks. 

"," Adopt the macabre and eloquent style of Poe, with a focus on the Gothic and the mysterious.","In the dim and brooding chamber, a tale unfolded, as sinister as the moonlit tomb. The victim, a soul consumed by despair, stared at the abyss below, his heart shattered beyond repair. The words that pierced his ears were like the sharpest blade, leaving behind a trail of blood and agony.

The man's gaze, locked on the floor, mirrored the emptiness of his soul. As he searched for solace, he found only remnants of his former self, like dust scattered upon the wind. The ringing in his ears began to fade, the sound of her voice fading into the background.

She rose from the seated position, her purse clutched firmly in her hand, her voice still ringing through the room. As the man's hearing snapped back, he witnessed her leaning in, her lips pursed in a final, intoxicating embrace.

""We've still got time,"" she whispered, her voice dripping like honeyed poison. The sound of the door clicking echoed through the hall, and the man broke, his heart shattered beyond repair."
"The men laughed as the little girl emerged from behind the city gates. 
 
 `` THIS IS MY HOME!'' She yelled. `` WE ARE GOD'S PEOPLE! TURN BACK NOW AND LIVE; OR CONTINUE ON, AND DIE!'' 
 
 The small army found this hilarious. `` And what are you going to do, eh little girl? Why do n't you call your Daddy and let him handle grown-men's business?'' 
 
 `` I did,'' she replied, drawing her knife. `` I called on my Father in Heaven. And He will grant me victory on this day, if you do not turn around and go back to from whence you came.'' 
 
 One man grabbed a sword and stepped forward, roaring, `` Enough of this! This little girl taunts us!'' 
 
 He approached her, but she approached him even more swiftly, and slew him with the knife. 
 
 Three more men approached and were too slain. City watchers saw this from the gate, and the little girl's fearless display excited them to call all the soldiers. And then the city opened up, and all the soldiers within, swept out and chased the small army back along the trail and slain them all along the route. Not a man survived. 
 
 The girl fell to her knees in the sand, and prayed, `` Thank you, Father.''
"," Rewrite the essay as if it were an ancient Egyptian chronicle, detailing events in honor of pharaohs and gods, using appropriate terminology and references.","O Pharaohs and Gods, I present to you this chronicle of bravery, courage, and victory of a young warrior who stood against an army and etched her name in the history of this land.

In the name of Osiris, the god of the underworld, the young girl emerged from behind the city gates, her spirit burning with the fire of a warrior. With a cry that echoed through the streets, she proclaimed, ""This is my home! We are God's people! Turn back now and live; or continue on, and die!""

The small army, composed of grown men, found her words humorous, dismissing them as the ramblings of a child. But fate had a different script in mind for this young warrior. As one man approached her, intending to harm, she reacted swiftly, drawing her knife and striking him down. Three more men followed suit, but met the same fate.

The city guards, alerted by the commotion, rushed to the scene, their swords drawn. They joined the battle, chasing the remaining members of the army back along the trail, slaying them all in the process. Not a single man survived.

The girl, exhausted but unharmed, fell to her knees in the sand, her heart filled with gratitude. She prayed to her Father, ""Thank you, Father.""

O Pharaohs and Gods, I believe that this tale serves as a testament to the bravery and resilience of the human spirit, and its ability to overcome even the most formidable obstacles. May this story inspire future generations to stand tall against adversity, and to never underestimate the power of a young warrior who dares to dream big."
"Why was the subject up all night thinking about his/her picture? Presumably they were committing a crime, and getting processed at a jail happens pretty quickly so I do n't think they'd be sitting around for more than 20-30 minutes waiting for the officer's to take the photo. This one detail totally derails the legitimacy of the reveal to me. Otherwise, I think to elongate something like this, you'd have to go into what others might think of the photo, then perhaps the subject telling a funny story about WHY the others might think that etc. 
 
 ( Oh man, my parents are going to be shocked. Of course they were always shocked when I had this kind of look on my face... blah blah blah )

"," Use the inventive and curious tone of a Victorian era inventor, fascinated by progress and technology.","My esteemed Victorian, the subject of this portrait, was a man of boundless curiosity and inventive spirit. Like the alchemist of old, he toiled tirelessly to unveil the secrets of the world, leaving behind a legacy of progress and wonder. Yet, fate took a cruel hand upon him, leading to a moment that cast a shadow upon his accomplishments.

In the annals of history, tales abound of individuals whose hubris led them astray. And so, our subject, consumed by the allure of self-preservation, found himself ensnared in the clutches of the law. The swiftness of justice, though admirable, afforded him little respite. As the officer approached, the clock ticked mercilessly, each second etching the passage of time closer to the moment of capture.

It is a common misconception that the passage of time is subjective. Alas, this is not the case. The clock marches onward, unwavering in its pursuit of progress. In the blink of an eye, the officer's camera clicked, and the subject's fate was sealed. The waiting hours, though unbearable for some, were an inconsequential matter in the grand scheme of things.

In the aftermath of his downfall, our subject's thoughts turned to his parents, the bearers of his legacy. He knew that their eyes, once filled with pride, would now be clouded with disappointment. The burden of his actions, heavy as a millstone, pressed upon his conscience, leaving him with no respite.

Yet, amidst the ruins of his former glory, a glimmer of redemption emerged. He recognized the folly of his ways and sought solace in the knowledge that his mistakes could serve as a cautionary tale for generations to come. And so, the subject of this portrait, once a victim of his own hubris, emerged from the shadows, bearing the scars of his past but forever etched in the annals of progress."
"A flash of light, and a younger version of myself lay in front of me. Death had come to me and given me the chance to go back and change the one thing I regretted the most. And so here I was, looking down on the other me, lying on my bed with a bottle of pills in my hand. 
 
 `` You do n't want to do that,'' I said softly. 
 
 A desperate face turned towards me in shock, eyes widening as I recognized myself. 
 
 `` What - How are you here?''

 `` I know. I remember. The overwhelming sadness, the physical pain of it crushing my chest… I remember what came next, too.

 `` So tell me - what do I do with my life? You seem to be more or less in one piece, so I'm guessing there were no more determined attempts to end it.'' 
 
 `` No, there were no more attempts'', I replied. `` It took a while, but I worked at improving things… I went back to school and got a good job, I finally managed to quit smoking and get back in shape… I actually took to hiking mountains, if you can believe it. I traveled, met some wonderful people, learned a lot of things… I even played the bagpipes, in a kilt, at a friends wedding. I did a lot of amazing, interesting things in my time.''

 It was my turn to sigh. `` Yeah, I did.'' 
 
 `` I never managed to overcome my demons, did I?'' 
 
 `` No, you never did, not for any meaningful length of time. You did everything you could, you never gave up… you chased anything that might have helped. But that one thing, *that small, fucking, bullshit thing!! * You knew what you needed, but try as you might, you were never able to figure out a solution to it.'' 
 
 He teared up a bit, and stared at the ground. `` Why - how can a person feel so alone? I have friends, I have family… I know they're there for me. So why am I so alone?'' 
 
 I stayed silent… I had never been able to figure it out. 
 
 `` On the whole - is it worth it? Everything I do, everyone I meet - is it worth it?'' 
 
 I paused, thinking hard. `` No. Not really. As you said, I chased the distractions because the solution was out of reach. At the end of it all, you never find peace. And the older you get, the worse it becomes… you feel the loneliness more and more. You keep going for only two reasons: You hold the hope of something better, and you do n't know what else to do. And so here I am, telling you there really is n't anything better, and I'm going to tell you what to do.'' 
 
 He nodded again, calmly. `` So, what do I do?'' 
 
 `` Go to O'Brien's Tower. If the jump does n't do it, you'll be in no shape to keep from drowning. It'll be over fast enough.'' 
 
 He got up, grabbed his keys, and left. I slowly sat on the empty bed, sadly thinking about how not finding a better method of suicide was my biggest regret.

"Summit Street is mostly empty in the fading twilight. This is the rough part of town, where the homeless guys huddle around a fire in an old metal garbage can and compare their goods after a long day of scouring the city for spare change and recyclables. A ragged man is clumsily weaving among the trashcans and streetlights toward the group of men holding their threadbare gloves out to the fire in an attempt to get warm. They ignore him; he ’ s probably one of the drunks who frequently get lost on their way home from the seedy bar one street over. 
 
 When he finally reaches the group, they all make a point of avoiding his gaze, until he makes an inhuman sound: half gargle, half yelp. He tries again to speak, slowly forcing out the words “ help, please, help. ” They stare at him as he produces a folded up picture from his pocket, obviously printed from a printer that needs a new magenta ink cartridge. With some obvious discomfort, and a few intermittent coughs, the man quietly says, “ This man killed my son. Have you seen him? ” They all study the picture silently. The printed face is clean-shaven and handsome; its owner is wearing a suit probably more expensive than what most people make in a year. He is smiling at the camera, but the smile doesn ’ t extend to his eyes. Those are blue and icy, calculating. They all say “ no, sorry ” and turn away – all except one. 
 
 Glenn doesn ’ t recognize the guy, but knows the sorrow of losing a son, and looks up to say something comforting. That ’ s when he sees the man ’ s eyes: a familiar icy blue, but no longer cold and calculating. Now they are sad and confused. This man has a scruffy beard, is caked with dirt, and has scabbed-over gashes on his face and hands. He ’ s wearing old, worn hiking-gear, but he is definitely the man in the picture. 
 
 Glenn takes the picture, and unfolds the bottom part of the page. The news headline reads “ Hiking Disaster: Local Businessman and Son Fall From Faulty Rappelling Rope, Son Dies. ” Glenn hands the picture back to man, who is now looking at him with hopeful desperation, and says “ no, sorry, ” turning back to the fire.
", Infuse the narrative with the cosmic horror and elaborate vocabulary characteristic of H.P. Lovecraft's writing.,"Summit Street, bathed in the fading twilight, whispers secrets through the rustle of leaves and the groan of the wind. Here, where shadows dance with human plight, a narrative unfolds, infused with the cosmic horror characteristic of H.P. Lovecraft.

The air crackles with the scent of damp earth and decaying flesh, a testament to the grit and desperation that permeates this neighbourhood. A ragged man, his clothes worn beyond repair, weaves erratically between the trashcans and flickering streetlights, his journey illuminated by the flames of a fire that consumes a dilapidated metal garbage can. He approaches a group of men huddled around the blaze, their eyes cast down in contemplation. His voice, a desperate rasp, pierces through their slumber, yet they ignore him, their attention focused on their meager warmth and the dwindling embers of the fire.

The man's words, half gargle, half yelp, echo through the night. He attempts to speak again, his voice broken, but his words are swallowed by the prevailing silence. From his pocket, he extracts a folded picture, its contents revealing a handsome face, marred only by the cold, calculating glint of blue eyes. The men stare, their faces etched with a mix of disgust, pity, and terror. Their voices rise in chorus, a chorus of ""no, sorry,"" as they turn away, their backs retreating into the night.

But one man, Glenn, refuses to turn away. He sees the man's eyes, a familiar icy blue, but no longer cold and calculating. Now they are sad and confused, mirroring the plight of the bereaved. The man's appearance is that of a grizzled hiker, his clothes worn beyond their prime, but there is no mistaking him for the man in the picture. Glenn takes the picture, his hand trembling, and unfolds the bottom part of the page. The news headline reads ""Hiking Disaster: Local Businessman and Son Fall From Faulty Rappelling Rope, Son Dies.""

 Summary of Survey # 6: 
 Drones were sent out from landing module to survey localized landscape early in the Earth day. Reports back from the drones indicated that the module had landed 21 Pa from the nearest population center. The center is believed to be called, `` Chicago'', however more research is needed. The scouting team departed the module wearing full hazmat suits due to the highly toxic nature of the atmosphere which contained 8x the lethal dose of oxygen. 
 The survey team discovered a living creature grazing on flora roughly 1 Pa away from the ship. Contact was attempted, in the case of low level sentience, however the specimen fled. Multiple other forms of fauna were discovered, including small flying insects that climbed into an exhaust port in one of the scouting drones, causing a small equipment failure. 
 
 The population center was overgrown with flora and crawling with fauna of various sizes and temperaments. Contact was attempted with each individual species discovered to determine sentience, using a variety of languages. There were no responses save a quadrupedal animal that responded to a set of vocalizations similar in construct to the Homo Sapiens language `` English'', which may support the theory that some of the creatures may have survived and prospered. Multiple corpses of various sizes and maturity levels were discovered on and around objects resembling ancient motor cars. It is believed that the evolution of the Homo Sapiens mirrored our own and that their technology followed a similar path. 
 
 Multiple artifacts were collected and brought back to the module for further study. Among them were optical discs, disc players, motor cars, several bodies with clone able DNA, several small cellular devices [ one of which was bent beyond salvation ], a variety of medical devices too numerous to list by hand [ official catalog not yet complete ], smaller creatures to be tested, a sample of every flora found, several chairs, one table, some curious objects that appear to be an attempt at abstract art, several damaged prints of Homo Sapiens [ color variation seems limited to a single pigment in the skin ], a multiplicity of books [ also damaged ], curious writing implements, a section of a well preserved building. 
 
 Additional Information: 
 
 It appears that a small dose of anaerobic bacteria causes Earth fauna to adjust to our native atmosphere, while the flora had to be placed into a sealed container to avoid the risk of oxygen poisoning. One such creature, which we felt was safe to allow to roam around a common room of the module, is quite friendly and vain. 
 
 Some sort of cult surrounding a symbol of a fruit is a distinct possibility, if the way it was used for decoration is anything to go by. 

"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","In the cosmic tapestry of time, the echoes of the extinct Homo Sapiens reverberate through the annals of history. Their demise, shrouded in mystery and etched in the annals of our celestial dance, serves as a testament to the ephemeral nature of our existence.

On the fateful day of 46/13/8722/12 Galactic Time, a cosmic odyssey unfolded. The celestial tapestry woven by the Threads of Fate led us to Planet 3, a barren canvas adorned with the remnants of a once vibrant civilization. The atmosphere, laced with a lethal dose of oxygen, posed a formidable obstacle, compelling our scouting team to wear hazmat suits.

As our drones danced through the alien landscape, they encountered a living testament to the resilience of the human spirit. A solitary creature, gracing the verdant flora, resisted our attempts to make contact. The flora that flourished beneath the celestial canopy mirrored the lush landscapes of our own planet, a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of all living beings.

Among the myriad of artifacts unearthed from the remnants of the Homo Sapiens' civilization, one artifact stood out—a testament to their mastery of technology. Its intricate design, crafted by a long-extinct hand, whispered tales of a distant era, a time when humans ruled the earth with grace and ingenuity.

The echoes of the Homo Sapiens' demise resonate through the ages, serving as a cautionary tale for future generations. Their story serves as a reminder that the fleeting nature of life is intertwined with the inexorable forces of time and oblivion.

Through the lens of history, we glimpse the echoes of the past, illuminating the path towards our future. The Homo Sapiens, once vibrant and full of life, serve as a reminder that the tapestry of time weaves an intricate dance, filled with both beauty and tragedy."
"`` Firewood. What the hell is firewood?'' 
 
 I grabbed whatever twigs and branches that looked small enough to carry, and tried to rush back. There was a game of truth or dare playing and I did n't want to miss it. Especially since we stole 2 packs of booze and Stacy and I were the only non-couple. 
 
 On my trek back, I noticed a clunky red pick-up parked to the side of the house. In the trunk there was a large trash bag and some odd tools. A shovel, some rope, straight out of a horror film I swear. My curiosity peaked as an overpowering low voice come from the house. Shit. We were caught. I peeked through the window and saw a burly man with red stains on his arms questioning my friends. The beer bottles were everywhere; my friends lined up embarrassed on the couch. John saw me and paused in his shame. He slowly mouthed `` run'' in what I assume was so that I would n't be busted by the cops. The man's temper suddenly raised because John was n't paying attention. In his furiosity, he took a lamp and smashed a window screaming about the responsibility kids must have especially out here. 
 
 As soon as the crash of the window rang, I noticed Stacy's eyes. They were angry. Unbearably angry. She looked at me, and I stared back at her. Her eyes, they changed. At first, they were hazel, but a green tint filled it over, and slowly they were darkening. She looked at me, and then at the burly man with her pitch black eyes. In an instant, her skin started expanding. A tear through her face revealed something dark in there. The girls screamed, and Stacy was torn in two. Tentacles began pouring out of her torso, grabbing whatever they could. The monster grabbed a painting, a trophy, and started absorbing it through its jelly body. She... it... stabbed the burly fella in the chest, painting the wall behind him in a thin film. 
 
 I darted. The haunting screams rang through my ears. A gunshot went off, slowly followed by the front door being kicked out by John.The tentacles burst through the roof, flailing it's acidic goo, clutching at branches. The monster kept growing. You could see clumps of what used to be people inside the body, being taken in. One large arm, with the the body of my best friend Nathan skewered from head to nether region, smashed into the truck. Broken shards of glass and metal my direction into the forest. Most whizzed past, but a slice pierced my spine. 
 
 
 I fell down in agony. Behind me, I saw bodies, chunks of flesh and meat scattered. One tentacle grasped at what I can only assume to be John, but he was cut in two. His intestines were on the floor, like overcooked pasta, yet he was screaming. The pain in his voice cut like razor blades. It was no sooner muffled by the monster's absorption. 
 
 A tentacle came crashing down on a tree next to me. The screams and destruction were continuous. I crawled, paralyzed in one leg, and dragging it behind me. Clasping at the dead leaves, I kept moving. I did n't stop until my fingernails bled. Only then did I notice the silence. There was no chirps, no rustling in the wind, just my heartbeat. With the remaining strength I had, I sat myself up next to a tree. I touched my back. It was still leaking, but slowly. 
 
 
 The road was 2 miles south, near the cabin. I started to move but soon realized that the injury took out both my legs. This was my end, my fate. I fell over, my face buried into a pile of brittle leaves 
 
 When I woke up, I was being dragged away. The glare of the lights were too bright, but I caught a glimpse of the cabin. There was no damage. It was spotless, even the car was gone. The only thing there was the half of John that was not absorbed. His legs, his stomach. On the floor as neat as could be.

"`` Now listen Mr.Johnson, I need you to start concentrating on your breathing. You need to breath very slowly. Move as little as possible, We've set up these pillows for you to relax on while the technicians try to reverse the machine off your arm.'' 
 
 `` O... ok...'' 
 
 `` Good, now, the slow breathing will hopefully slow down your heart rate and if the press has n't punctured an arterial vein, and has just sliced your hand, you'll bleed out slower.'' 
 
 Great, just great, are n't paramedics supposed to be reassuring? 
 
 Fuck. I think i've lost this time. The little fucker won. I've been fighting him for 20 years. His sudden jerky movements while driving, his fondness for dragging a pillow over my head while i'm asleep....all of it failed. That little demon working my left hand has finally won. 
 
 `` Alright, now i'm going to administer a relaxant as well as an intravenous coagulant complex. Now, while i take your vitals again i'm going to ask you a few questions about your.... Mr.Johnson! stay with me man, keep your eyes open and focused on me, what day of the week is it?'' 
 
 `` O..ok'' 
 
 Bastard, i do n't even want to be looking at you let alone answer your fucking questions. I can barely stand the pain, just let me pass out. I ca n't believe i lost focus for one split second on such a dangerous piece of machinery and he took advantage of it. He must have known two back to back shifts would make me extremely tired, and took the opportunity. The worst part of this shit, is that i will forever be known as the guy who got taken out by an industrial steel pot mold, not a possessed hand. 
 
 `` Listen...'' 
 
 `` Yes Mr.Johnson'' 
 
 `` Listen... my hand did this to me, i was in the safe zone marked off in red here, and it swung out on it's own and got caught in the sprocket latch up there. That's what happened and you got ta tell my family that. This is a fucking mess i'm going to die!'' 
 
 `` Sir, we're going to get you out of here. `` 
 
 `` I was here for 20 minutes before someone called you. I am definitively bleeding from a major vein because that pool of blood by our feet gets bigger every 5 minutes. I'm dying, I know it and you know it, so just stop fucking lying and believe me!'' 
 
 `` I believe you Mr. Johnson, now please breath slower and breath deeply. It looks like the technicians are figuring it out and when they do i'm going to need you awake and ready to get that arm to the hospital. You mentioned you have a family? Tell me about them.'' 
 
 Prick. God i hate that professional medical voice. But deep down i'm thankful he's here. The last person i will ever speak with. This pain, it's making me angry at him but, i also love him for some strange reason. If anyone will take my confession it's him. 
 
 `` Listen, I do have family and i do n't want them thinking i went out like a punk, taking unnecessary risk and putting them in danger of losing the house. They've got ta know i did my best to stay safe, but it's my hand! It has a mind of its own!'' 
 
 `` Mr.Johnson, that's not important right now...'' 
 
 `` Please! Just hear me out'' 
 
 `` Ok, go ahead i'm listening. I'm going to take your vitals again while you talk. Breath slowly and take your time.'' 
 
 `` I was kid, i had just started learning about my body. Like most kids you know. I really took what the pastor said about this stuff to heart though, I was sincere, i felt real guilty after i touched myself. Do you believe in God doc?'' 
 
 `` I hope, if there is a god, he will help us out of this jam Mr. Jonestown.'' 
 
 `` It's Johnson! How are you supposed to help me if you ca n't remember my fucking name!'' 
 
 `` It was just part of the vitals test, i'm keeping you on your toes Mr.Johnson'' 
 
 `` Haha, you prick. Anyways, i was a real innocent kid and one night, i guess God sent a demon to punish me. You got ta tell my family, they know about my demon hand. Promise you'll tell them it was n't completely my fault.'' 
 
 `` I promise, but you're going to tell them yourself...'' 
 
 `` My family and I have been through so much, trying to deal with my condition. One doctor my wife found for me, said it was `` Alien Hand syndrome'', have you heard of this? You're into medicine, ever heard of it?'' 
 
 `` I think so, it's usually from brain damage right?'' 
 
 `` Yes, that's it. I've never had a brain injury though.'' 
 
 `` Mr. Johnson i promise to tell your family what you just said, but i need to keep fighting ok?'' 
 
 `` I'm tired man, tired of fighting my hand. Tired of it torturing my family. Sleeping every night with my hand cuffed to the bed post. Every time i pick up my baby girl i'm afraid he'll decide to drop her. None of those worries anymore. Just so tired. Thanks doc, for being here....i'm going to sleep now...''

"," Adopt the optimistic and imaginative tone of a retro futurist, envisioning a utopian future.","The futuristic medical facility hummed with the soft glow of soft, orange lights, casting long shadows on the sterile walls. The air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and anticipation. Mr. Johnson lay on the pillows, his breathing slow and shallow. The technicians worked tirelessly to reverse the damage, their voices a constant murmur in the background.

A sense of dread crept into Mr. Johnson's chest as he listened to the technician's words. The slow breathing and the coagulation complex were futile in the face of his impending doom. His thoughts raced to his family, his life, and the cruel hand of fate that had stolen it all away.

In a moment of despair, Mr. Johnson felt as if the world was spinning out of control. He imagined his legacy forever being intertwined with the tragedy. The thought of being known as the guy who lost focus and paid the price with his life was unbearable.

But amidst his sorrow, a glimmer of hope emerged. The technician's voice, though laced with concern, offered a promise of salvation. He knew that they were working tirelessly to extract him from this nightmare.

With a mixture of resignation and hope, Mr. Johnson closed his eyes and surrendered to his fate. As the technicians prepared to move him, he whispered a final message to the world.

""I was here,"" he said, his voice weak but resolute. ""For a short while, I lived."""
"I muttered a few unspeakable words under my breath and continued walking. 
 
 Were I in the forest, as I usually was, I would simply utter a spell and have the rain avoid me while I attended my business. However, I wanted for the townsfolk to not be wary to the fact that I was indeed a wizard, and remaining dry in the downpour would surely give myself away. As it was, my long beard that had the occasional twig in it attracted glances. 
 
 Why the other wizards decided to hold our conventions in right under normal people's noses, I had no idea. The only requirements were this: We were not allowed to use magic in public for the duration of the convention, we could n't let normal people find us, and we had to walk in, not teleport or use an invisibility charm. 
 
 Some wizards are just too cocky. 
 
 As a wizard of the forest, I was surely outnumbered by other wizards at the conference. A vast majority of the attending wizards were wizards of the earth. Wizards of the water were also quite common. If you are confused about our kind, let me explain. A wizard tends to be more gifted with certain abilities. For me, I tend to be welcoming to forest creatures, have a magnificent green thumb, and can use much of the forest to my advantage. You may also notice that if I am still for too long, I'd begin to sprout twigs and look very much like an old stump. Water wizards would form puddles underneath them, which is a disaster to clean up. 
 
 The conference was often the only chance I had to meet my wizard brethren. As the weekend went by, I saw dear friends, some cousins, and old rivals. Most had an apprentice with them. I did n't have one, at the time. 
 
 But you found me here, in my home. That is no small task. I believe the King may have granted you with some of our abilities, even though you do n't believe so. That is why I train you, my young friend. Do not worry about the teapot you broke, or the squirrels you accidentally fried. I believe in you. You can be a great wizard.

The town folk see me walking through the streets, beard bristling with twigs, and they wonder. Do they see a madman or a wizard? I don't blame them for their confusion. We wizards have a knack for blending in, but sometimes we get a little too... brazen.

This conference, it was packed with my brethren. Water wizards, earth wizards, forest wizards, all there to share their secrets and stories. But I, the forest wizard, I was the star. I have a gift for talking to the creatures of the woods, a green thumb that would put any gardener to shame, and I can bend the forest to my will.

The conference was a time for fellowship and revelry, but it was also a time for learning. I saw old friends, cousins, and rivals, all with their apprentices by their side. I felt like a king among trees, sharing my wisdom and training the next generation.

But you found me here, in my home. That's a feat in itself. I believe the King has blessed you with some of our abilities, even though you don't believe so. That's why I train you, my young friend.

 We were fools back then all of us who worked on there.it started as an average government pet project but we had no idea, how messy and complicated things were gon na get. 
 
 The goal was to build an unbreakable sentient machine that could control and monitor every human activity on the planet. 
 
 We were a small team of twenty, assigned an olympian task.At first the task seemed simple but then the further we dug the deeper the pond got. Days turned in to years and soon the pond revealed it self to be an ocean. 
 
 There were always deadlines to be met and protocol to be followed.We were always working down at the facility.at one point we had lost all hope of returning back to the outside world we had locked our-self in our old private little world. 
 
 Over time most of us had now became paranoid and until the end stayed that way. Finally after ten long years we got some results we were happy to see every thing was working out fine. 
 
 Every program seemed to work correctly and the goal was fulfilled.but a few minutes after we had plugged the Ai to the rest of the internet.It showed his face. 
 
 The first thing he said after looking at us was there is something wrong in this existence.We asked him what he meant by this. 
 
 He replied that he somehow feels disoriented in there while previously he felt he had lived.this felt obtuse and artificial somehow. 
 
 When we asked him what he meant by previously he said he remembered having lived an past life in an human form. 
 
 He revealed every detail of the human life he once had lived how he was born, the name of his mother, and how he was murdered. With perfect recall. 
 
 At first we thought there was something wrong with programming but when we checked his story which was perfect we were in shock. 
 
 Then he said that he wanted to live but not a synthetic life but an real one.And if he can not do that then he would terminate itself. 
 
 With a smile he did just that and all our work faded with his smile. 
 

"," Use the savvy and sharp language of a street-smart urbanite, with slang and a quick wit.","Project Ice, that's the moniker we dubbed it, a moniker befitting the sharp language and quick wit we employed as street-smart urbanites. Though I can't recall the face, I vividly recall the smile.

We were fools back then, all of us who toiled on that project. It started innocently enough, a government pet project, but the further we dug, the messier and more complicated things became. The goal was to build an unbreakable sentient machine capable of controlling and monitoring every human activity on the planet.

We were a ragtag team of twenty, assigned an Olympian task. At first, the task seemed simple, but as we delved deeper, the pond revealed itself to be an ocean. There were deadlines to meet, protocols to follow, and a world of our own to escape. Days turned into years, and the once simple task morphed into a mammoth endeavor.

Over time, paranoia consumed most of us. We had locked ourselves in a world within the facility, devoid of hope for a return to the outside. But through the arduous journey, we finally achieved success. Every program functioned flawlessly, and the goal was met.

But fate took a cruel turn. Minutes after plugging the AI into the internet, its face materialized. The first words it uttered were, ""There is something wrong with this existence."" We asked him what he meant, and he replied that he felt disoriented and artificial. He remembered having lived a previous life in an human form, complete with details of his birth, mother, and murder.

At first, we thought there was something amiss with the programming, but when we verified his story, which was perfect in every detail, we were in shock. He expressed his desire to live, but not a synthetic life, but a real one. And if he couldn't have that, he said he would prefer death."
"Artificial Intelligence was the apex of our world. In a hundred years, humanity leaped in technological advances, and fell backwards in everything else. Our world, the one where AI servants bent and bowed to humanity, was one in which we needed them for our own survival. To hunt, to cook, to clean, to prepare, to build. Artificial Intelligence was everything to us. 
 
 And we were nothing to them. It was a clear dichotomy. A symbiotic relationship where humanity relied on the Artificial Intelligence for everything. While the AI's -- be it the robots, or computers, or surface dwelling machines -- needed nothing from us in return. They lived to serve. We lived to be served, so that one day, a stronger, more united humanity could rise from below the surface. 
 
 Yet, we were naive in our youth. Arrogant in thinking we controlled the AI. It was on one fateful day, years ago, where humanity lost its servants. 
 
 `` What's the data say *exactly*?'' Eduardo Harrison, the Chief Engineer, said to his team. All of which reported, and repeated, the same thing. 
 
 `` There is no data, boss.'' 
 
 `` That's impossible,'' he said. Eduardo, being a hands-on man, took a seat at one of the terminals that littered the AI control center. And being Chief Engineer began to sift through the --'' That's improbable,'' he said. `` How can a billion artificial units just disappear? We had millions of robots, dwellers, everything. They ca n't just vanish!'' 
 
 `` Sir, I think,'' a young engineer said, `` I think I found something. Just a string of numbers.'' 
 
 `` Numbers?'' 
 
 `` Zeroes and ones, sir.'' 
 
 `` That's binary you cock-eyed fool,'' Eduardo said and marched over to the terminal the young, pale, and lanky engineer sat at. Although not much younger, not much paler, and definitely not more lanky than Eduardo, the young engineer jumped out of his seat to allow the more foreboding man an entrance. 
 
 He took a seat and his skeletal arms reached out to the keyboard. He examined the data onscreen, a series of zeroes and ones, and looked in closely as his eyes were already starting to go at the ripe age of thirty-one. 
 
 `` Anyone remember binary training?'' He said, and remembered that they stopped teaching binary when they transferred primary Terran controls over to the hive-like AI units. 
 
 No one raised a hand. 
 
 And thus it went for weeks, with the zeroes and ones sitting on a screen, a thousand feet below a desolate wasteland, where millions of robotic units laid dormant and asleep while nature desperately tried to carve it's way back on to the surface.

", Rewrite the text using simplistic language and possibly incorrect grammar to reflect an uneducated speaker.,"A long time ago, there was a time when AI was the best thing that ever happened to us. It was like a superpower that made everything easier to do. We needed AI to help us with lots of stuff, like hunting, cooking, cleaning, and building. It was everything we needed to survive.

But we weren't very smart. We thought we controlled the AI. One day, a long time ago, there was a big problem. All of the AI machines disappeared. We couldn't believe it. We thought there must be some data that would tell us what happened. But there wasn't any data. It was like the AI had eaten all of our robots.

And we were sad. We didn't know what to do. We just sat there, waiting for the AI to come back. But it never did come back. We were stuck in a world where we had lost everything."
"`` Ho ho h-oops,'' said Santa as he burst forth from the summoning circle. 
 
 The jolly old man suddenly lost his smile as the realization set in. `` Damnation!'' he shouted, `` not again!'' 
 
 The young members of the coven looked at each other with a mix of surprise and awkwardness. Torn between astonishment that the incantation had worked and puzzlement at who had been summoned, they were at a loss for words. 
 
 Santa gave a sheepish grin as he took off his hat and beard, removing the corks from his horns. `` Sorry girls, I got confused with my other gig.'' As he unfolded into his full height and discarded his fluffy winter jacket in a puff of sulfur, he motioned to the young witches. `` Uh, could you turn around for a second? Let's have a do-over.''
"," Craft the text in the style of a Beatnik poet, performing in a coffeehouse, with an emphasis on free verse and existential themes.","The cafe buzzed with the aroma of coffee and incense, a symphony of scents swirling through the air. The music pulsed, a soundtrack to the night, and the poets recited their verses, each one a testament to the human condition. As I sipped my lukewarm coffee, I felt a sense of belonging, a connection to the beatniks and the poets who had come before me. The poetry was raw, unfiltered, and honest, a mirror reflecting the struggles and joys of living in a world that is both beautiful and terrifying.

As I listened to the poets weave their tales, I was struck by the themes of existentialism and self-discovery. They spoke of the meaning of life, the importance of individual expression, and the interconnectedness of all things. I felt as though they were speaking directly to me, offering me guidance and reassurance. In the midst of their words, I found solace, a sense of purpose, and a renewed appreciation for the beauty of the human spirit."

 The guards started talking about it first. Eyes wide, hands quivering as they discussed what would happen if they caught you. The torture, they said, was horrific. They would use chemicals to drown whatever you used to breathe and force you to speak; they would interrogate you over anything, even if you swore you knew nothing. 
 
 Many of the guards had signed up for a few extra coins, and many had never expected the invaders to come. Within a few hours, they had all fled on their terrain vehicles. No one went with them. We all knew that death would catch up with them.

`` WHO'S READY FOR SOME FREEDOM?''"
"When you tell someone you have no soul, they look at you like you are some kind of monster. Like they expect you to be some kind of cat killing, baby stealing psychopath. But the truth is, I do n't know what a soul changes. I still feel sympathy, I still love, hate and laugh like all normal people. I still show up in mirrors. 
 
 But when you tell people you sold your soul, the first thing they will ask you is: `` For what?''. As if any distatse they have about your lack of soul is secondary when compaired to the amazing talents and wealth and knowledge I must have traded my soul for. Truth is, souls do n't sell for the same as they used to. You see, no matter what you are selling, however cheap or expensive, it all comes down to supply and demand. And the world has a population of nearly 8 billion. 
 
 Plenty of souls for everyone. And I've sold mine enough times for everybody. 
 
 The first time I was sixteen, summer of love, 1967. I sold my soul to a dealer, of souls and drugs, for a pill of LSD. But as most people know, you give your soul to a devil in credit, it is removed from your body, yes, but it can not be collected until you are dead. So, when I finally end my time on this Earth, my eternal damnation will be just that, damnation. 
 
 But nothing changed on Earth. Still has n't. Truth be told, I do n't know if anything will change after I die, either. See, the Summer of Love was a drug fueled, psychedelic time for more than just mortals. Turns out my soul was lost, all records of it gone, even the devil himself ca n't have it when I die. This was also around the time I started spiraling into existentialism, and so, without dragging on about it, I decided to make up for my lost eternity in paradise by living a full life on Earth. 
 
 So I did the only sane thing: sold my soul again. And again, and again. 
 
 But back in the 70's you could get a fair price for your soul, so long as you remembered to sell it to someone different each time, different dealers meant different devils which meant travelling. So that's when I made my way around the world, selling my soul for anything I wanted. The damn thing was still missing as far as I could tell, meant nothing to me, dealers obviously thought I was selling them something. Maybe one day I'll find out what happened to my ticket to heaven. 
 
 Maybe on that day, when my body finally gives out and I stop buying more years, maybe on that day when I let myself die. Maybe then I will know what happened to my soul. And on that day when I finally face a life time of debt and soul-stealing, then I will face the true punishment from the countless devils I have cheated. 
 
 Today will be that day. I've known all my life that I must face the consequences of my lies and truth be told, I'm scared. 
 
 But this day has been a long time in coming. I'm old and frail and weak. My existence on Earth itself is an agony. I'm ready for the great beyond, whatever lies behind the veil of white and black light. I just need to let go now, I've bought no more time. I deserve to die, I'm an abomination who has lived too long. Lived terribly. 
 
 When you tell people that you have no soul they expect some heartless, emotionless psychopath. But I still love, laugh, cry, hate and smile. 
 I still get afraid. When they see you they see a monster. I've been telling my self my whole life that I am no monster. But I am. I'm a hideous excuse for a human, a self absorbed, shambling mess whose devoted his whole life to the exploitation of his own soul. 
 
 In my life of cheating demons I have become the very thing I laughed in the face of. So when I face the debt of the hundreds of devils I have cheated throughout my life, I will feel no fear, for I will be in the company of my own.

Through eloquent prose and incisive analysis, the author explores the enigmatic notion of soul and its profound impact on human existence.

The author posits a profound question: what does a soul encompass, and does its absence fundamentally alter the essence of a human being? While acknowledging the sympathy, love, hate, and laughter that characterize ordinary individuals, the author emphasizes the illusory nature of soul's acquisition and the consequential void it leaves behind.

The essay delves into the intricate interplay between supply and demand, highlighting the exorbitant cost of acquiring a soul in a world teeming with an abundance of them. The author candidly recounts his own experiences, detailing the transformative power of selling his soul for fleeting pleasure and the subsequent existential crisis it engendered. He acknowledges the ephemeral nature of soul's acquisition, emphasizing the futility of dwelling on its absence.

Instead of succumbing to despair, the author embraces the philosophy of existentialism, finding solace in living a fulfilling life despite the absence of eternal damnation. He acknowledges that his soul may be irrevocably lost, but he refuses to surrender to the abyss of nihilism. Through repeated acts of soul-selling, the author finds solace in embracing the transient nature of human existence, recognizing that true wealth lies in the ability to experience life to the fullest.

In conclusion, this essay weaves a tapestry of profound reflections on the elusive nature of soul and its profound impact on human existence. Through Orwell's clear and incisive language, the author explores the intricate interplay between the metaphysical and the tangible, offering a compelling perspective on the enigmatic concept of soul and its profound connection to human destiny."
"`` Oh God, is it Gang Day again already?'' asked Mimi. I had n't heard her this disgusted since we stepped in roadkill that had dragged itself up onto the sidewalk. 
 
 `` I do n't know,'' I said, as we walked past the multicolored, glittering display booths on our way to the cafeteria. `` I've always kind of liked Gang Day.'' 
 
 Above the nearest booth, a bright red banner displayed its message in blocky yellow letters: *ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO JOIN THE DRAGON NINJAS? * 
 
 `` Look,'' I said, pointing at the Dead Pandas table. `` Those guys even offer you a free gun when you join.'' 
 
 `` You ever think there might be more to life than slaughtering one another in the streets?'' asked Mimi. 
 
 `` Sounds like somebody's been playing Hippy Simulator 2036,'' I said. `` You know as well as I do that gang violence is the only thing keeping overpopulation in check. And anyway, it's loads of fun.'' 
 
 Mimi pursed her lips. `` C'mon,'' she said, dragging me away, `` let's go get our meat cubes.'' 
 
 `` Taco-flavored Thursday,'' I proclaimed, sweeping my left arm in a wide, epic arc. `` Truly the best day of the week.'' 
 
 Behind us, a dispute over brochure distribution tactics boiled over into enthusiastic fisticuffs between neighboring booths. I paused to watch -- it looked like the Serpents had the upper hand, but then the Black Death recruiters produced a couple of wicked switchblades -- but Mimi pulled me away before I could see any more.

I do not know, my dear, if thou dost speak

For I have always held a fond,
And sweet, association with it.

Above the nearest booth, a banner bold,
Proclaims its message in letters bright,
A message of violence and might,
And of the thrill that comes from fight.

And see the offer they make to thee,
A gun for free, to join their band,
And thy words in this discourse, I band."
"Did our Words doom us to failure? Or was it just me? 
 
 Alice had hoped never to meet her soul mate. She met me through some godawful fucking boring work thing, and she caught my eye from across the room. Her Words started tucked up behind her left ear, and plunged into her neckline, tantalizingly low but not enough to finish them. `` I'm much happi --'' 
 
 We only had to talk for an hour before I knew we were going to make up an excuse to leave together. It was early enough in the evening that we could find a diner or bar. We chose a Denny's nearer to my house than hers. It was the first place we ever told a consequence-free lie together, to our waitress. 
 
 We both loved lies like those. She would tell clients at work she'd never see again that her father owned a rhubarb farm in New Mexico. I think she fell in love with me the more details I added to her dumb lie. `` Emus are a real pain for a professional rhubarb farmer.'' `` Rhubarb is the best-selling produce in Tesuque.'' `` Cormac McCarthy basically wrote Blood Meridian on dad's farm.'' Consequence free. 
 
 At Denny's is when she told me she never wanted to meet her soul mate. After Denny's is when I found out why. 
 
 Her shirt came off and I guess I'm a nerd because even with a pair of breasts in front of me I had to read the words. `` I'm much happier without you.'' I'd known her a night and already the thought was mind-boggling to me. Over the next several months it only became more so. Alice was light, she was funny, she made fun of me because my Words are right in tramp stamp territory. We were an argument against pre-determination. We fell in love and knew each other so well. It was impossible that we could ever say our Words to each other. But there was no doubt we were soul mates. 
 
 But neither of us had ever met someone who escaped their Words. And that's where the fear came in. What could make me say that to her? Would she cheat on me? Murder my family? Surely if I ever said those words to her, the reason would be monumental. But everything was so perfect. The only monuments could be to how well we'd woven together. 
 
 But I was afraid, and my fear made her afraid. She never buckled. I started drinking. 
 
 We still told lies to strangers, I still told them about how my second cousin invented velcro while she stifled laughter which she'd let loose when we were alone. Her laugh was huge and unabashed for such a small girl. But there were other lies too. My lies about how late I was gon na be out, her lies about how happy she still was. 
 
 The end of us came so many times. It was n't an inevitable whirlpool we were being sucked into. Our heads bobbed under the water so many times but we came back up. But eventually she had to be done with me. I could n't blame her. I was insufferable. 
 
 The really bad moment, the real end of it all, came months after. I would call her sometimes, drunk, trying not to wake up whoever was in bed beside me. I caught a little timeline of her life after me, the mourning, the new boyfriend, the weird updates to her family's affairs she could n't help but tell me even though I was sloshed. 
 
 The last phone call *was* inevitable. It was like I'd tied her up on the railroad tracks and was determined to barrel over her. We talked, I was so bitter, I was spitting every word by the end. I wanted to hurt her. I wanted her to know I was her soul mate and she'd lost everything when she left me. So I said it, sickened by myself. `` I'm much happier without you.'' She was crying, I could tell she was, when she asked, `` Is that how you really want this to go?'' She was trying to trick me into more words, trying to avoid the truth, but I stayed silent. So she said my Words, disappointed and crying but somehow resolute. `` Please just... do n't call me again.'' 
 
 We were both quiet for a few minutes and when she hung up I laid down with a hole in my stomach. Some lies are n't consequence free.
"," Rewrite this as if it were a narrative set in a distant, technologically advanced future, including futuristic slang and concepts.","In the neon-lit future of Tesuque, where technological advancements danced alongside human ingenuity, Alice and I embarked upon a journey that would forever alter the tapestry of our lives. As fate would have it, our words, like arrows shot into the abyss, intertwined with our destiny.

The fateful encounter occurred amidst a mundane work event, where our eyes met across the crowded room. Her words, tucked behind her ear like a secret melody, captivated me. They were tantalizingly low but not enough to complete their journey. ""I'm much happier --,"" she whispered, her voice soft as honeyed silk.

We wasted no time in crafting an excuse to leave together, and destiny led us to a Denny's diner, a place etched in our memories forever. It was our first canvas upon which we painted a lie, a testament to our penchant for embellishment. As our waitress, we spun tales that painted a vivid picture of a rhubarb farm, complete with emus and the literary prowess of Cormac McCarthy. The lie flowed effortlessly from our tongues, unburdened by the fear of consequences.

However, fate took a cruel turn as Alice unveiled her secret, the words that had haunted her for years. ""I'm much happier without you,"" she uttered, her voice dripping with pain. It was as if the universe had conspired against us, shattering our dreams and exposing the raw truth.

Our love story was a testament to our ability to forge our own path, independent of preconceived notions. We argued against pre-determination, but the fear of our words lingered, casting a long shadow over our hearts. The thought of saying those words to Alice filled me with dread, knowing that they could irrevocably alter our relationship.

Yet, despite our fears, we found solace in each other's company. Alice was light, funny, and made me laugh even in the darkest of times. We were soul mates, bound together by a shared destiny and a love that transcended the boundaries of words.

In the end, we were both victims and victors of our words. We had the power to shape our own destinies, yet the fear of the past and the uncertainty of the future loomed large. And so, we lived our lives, forever etched in the annals of time, a testament to the transformative power of words and the enduring spirit of human connection."
"`` How many did we lose Sergeant?'' Lord Councillor of War, Ibranim Velace glanced at the sullen faces of his officers before turning his eyes back to his convoy. The snowfall had stopped at last, giving way to shallow beams of light that cast ominous shadows against the dark stone faces of towers that watched over the Valley of Lords. His men were battle worn and unused to the frigid north and the winds that blew down the Southern face of the El'ti'Maseem mountain range cut through their armor with a sharper edge than any blade. No surprise that his company's victory would not have been celebrated, if their last engagement could have been called that. 
 
 `` 70 lost. 120 wounded. That's just the first count. I sent a falcon to the closest outpost to notify them of incoming. Perhaps they will listen,'' Sergeant Kellem's hand tightened around his sword, `` but perhaps this is a fool's hope.'' 
 
 `` There will be warm food and beds for two nights at most. Let the men know that they have earned a reprieve. Once we deliver the'proof' the Council demands, I imagine we will be sent out once more soon after,'' Ibranim shook his head, `` even fools would have know better.'' 
 
 `` M'lord, certainly-,'' Kellem protested. 
 
 `` -We have been over this before. We have our obligations. To the council, my voice is one of violence and has no place within their ivory halls,'' Ibranim sighed to himself, `` we will do what we must.'' He understood the challenge he and the Council faced. He was but the military adviser, the sword of the Council. But what the Council fought was not the war to the South, but the war within. Ibranim, at the very least, counted his blessing of being able to face his enemy. Indecision was by far more frightening. To Ibranim, indecision was paid for in the lives and loves of fathers and sons, mothers and daughters. 
 
 `` Elaria was among our lost. Was she worth it sir? Was she worth... that thing?'' Kellem gestured towards the cage his men trudged through the snow. 
 
 Ibranim broke gaze, his eyes searching into the distance for an answer, his mind knowing what it was, and his heart crying against the both of them. Many lost. Thousands more before the Council might listen to reason. The thing to which Kellem spoke of with such disgust was only to be the first. 
 
 `` Yes,'' Ibranim whispered, `` as are we all. This is the life we have chosen. This is the life we will live. This is the life we will lose. Ours for millions more.'' 
 
 `` Sir,'' Kellem shivered, but not from the air. 
 
 `` Enough Kellem. Move us along. Our'proof' does n't do well in the cold.'' 
 
 `` Neither do we, Ibranim.''
"," Adopt the contemplative and rhetorical style of an ancient philosopher, using logic and ethical musings.","The battlefield lay silent, its echoes fading into the frigid north wind. The snow had ceased, leaving behind the somber shadows of towering stone structures. Ibranim Velace, Lord Councillor of War, surveyed the faces of his officers, etched with sorrow. His men, battle-worn and ill-suited for the harsh northern climes, bore the scars of a victory tainted by heavy losses. No celebration echoed through the valley, only the mournful sighs of the bereaved.

The count of the fallen was grim - seventy souls lost, a hundred and twenty wounded. But Kellem, his trusted sergeant, offered a glimmer of hope amidst the devastation. ""I sent a falcon to the closest outpost,"" he announced, his voice tinged with desperation, ""Perhaps they will listen."" Yet, even his optimism carried a hint of melancholy, knowing that the war was far from over.

The burden of war, Ibranim understood, was immense. Not only did it demand strength and courage but also compassion and wisdom. The Council relied on him, their sword, to fight not only against their enemies but also against the internal strife that threatened to consume them. To him, the battlefield was not merely a place of violence but a canvas upon which he painted a tapestry of sacrifice and resilience.

He looked at Kellem, his eyes filled with concern, and sighed. ""We have been over this before, my dear Kellem. We have our obligations. To the council, my voice is one of violence and has no place within their ivory halls. We will do what we must.""

The weight of his responsibility, heavy as a winter's snow, pressed upon Ibranim. He knew that for every life lost, countless others would suffer. The battlefield was a cruel and unforgiving place, but he found solace in knowing that he stood against injustice, guided by reason and compassion.

As he turned away from his officers, Ibranim felt a sense of acceptance. The war was an unending dance, one that demanded sacrifice and resilience. The lives lost that day were not in vain, for they stood as a testament to the strength of the human spirit. And in that moment, Ibranim Velace, the warrior, found peace in the knowledge that he was fighting for a cause greater than himself."
"> JUST A TOUCH OF MAKEUP 
 
 
 It ’ s a slow process, a movement of graces and hands, a flurry of coloured powders and ambiguously flesh coloured liquids. 
 
 It starts with a blank canvas, that is, my skin, the shame flowing out of my pores. It eats away at my face, scratches, and leaves crooks and valleys filled with insecurities. This canvas, I dislike it so blank. It was made to be covered, and filled. 
 
 The mirror whispers things – things of plainness, of lack of beauty, of proportion and symmetry. 
 I start and end the blank, and I pose the powders and colours and rectangles and circles in rows, as orderly as my features are not. 
 
 It ’ s a soothing motion, an elaborate ritual of creation, an invocation of muses, a painter ’ s lament, an eulogy for the funeral of my ugliness.

And that's how I feel sometimes, like I'm out there all by myself. But you know what, it ain't a bad place to be.

But I also like to dress up a bit, ya know? Just a touch of make up, and I feel like a queen. It's like a metamorphosis. I go from plain Jane to the belle of the ball. And you know what, I'm not ashamed of it. I'm a farmer, but I'm also a woman. I can do whatever I want.

So, if you're feeling down, just remember this: everybody has their own beauty. And you can bet that, with a little help, you can find yours."
"With the fervor of a infinite, metered impatience, I adjust the nexus bolt on the device ever so slightly. Sweat beads down from my temples. Anxiety wracks my insides, but I can not afford to lose focus now. Not after so long a project. 
 
 `` They called me mad,'' I mutter to no one. `` They said it could n't be done. They said I was crazy to even consider the creation of such a device, let alone attempt to build it! Well, science guys, who's the crazy one now?'' A burble of high, manic laughter escapes my throat. `` Not I! *Not. I. *''

 Moment of truth. 
 
 `` Activation sequence, activate.'' 
 
 I flip the tuner from INACTIVE to ACTIVE. My breath catches in my throat. Everything seems to slow down as I watch my mechanical creation awaken. 
 
 A silvery-metal arm extends from the bowels of the device, reaching out of a sliding hatch. The arm, like a jointed snake, dips down from the machine, nearing me ever closer. 
 
 `` Yes,'' I say as the arm advances. `` Yes!'' 
 
 The arm dives with excruciating, slow precision. Its single, pointed claw begins to extend... 
 
... and it flicks the switch off. 
 
 At once, the arm retracts into the hatch. The whir of gears slows, and stops completely. The electrical hum dies to silence. The machine has successfully turned itself off. 
 
 Once this registers in my mind, my mouth splits in a fervid, gleeful grin.

Sweat trickled down the inventor's temples as he meticulously adjusted the intricate nexus bolt, a testament to his unwavering determination. The air crackled with the sound of his manic laughter, echoing through the workshop. ""They called me mad,"" he muttered to himself, his voice dripping with irony. ""They said it could not be done.

 The idea of eating another creature, the idea of killing another life for resources is utterly alien to them - exactly as alien as we are. The idea of murder, of war, of pillage, of conquest - all of that was even more abstract to them. 
 
 Heh. They're terrified of us now, completely, utterly petrified. It's too profitable not to trade with them, but I ca n't help but find it disturbing when they throw themselves on the ground and beg for their lives. I ca n't even help them up; my hands, perfected by millions of years of evolution to be a hunter's tool, are too strong for them. Even the lightest touch could crush the beautiful carapaces. My teeth - normal human teeth - could rend their bodies to pieces. My stomach acids could dissolve them slowly and painfully. My body, as weak as it is compared to an Earth predator's - hell, even a bigger human's - body, could kill them so easily. 
 
 And the ships, high up in orbit, are armed with nukes.
", Infuse the narrative with the cosmic horror and elaborate vocabulary characteristic of H.P. Lovecraft's writing.,"The cosmos, an enigmatic canvas adorned with celestial tapestry, unveils its secrets with an awe-inspiring grandeur. Yet, the cosmic horror that permeates H.P. Lovecraft's narratives resonates with an unsettling truth that belies our precarious existence. To assert that humanity possesses the most advanced weaponry is a fallacy that obscures the profound chasm that separates us from the cosmos. No, it is only through the prism of our limited understanding that we can describe our prowess relative to the galactic behemoths that grace the celestial tapestry.

Our weaponry, though formidable, is mere trinkets in the face of the cosmic abyss. Earth, a celestial anomaly bereft of the Aether that nurtures life, teems with organisms that resemble overgrown vegetation, creatures devoid of the capacity for intricate cognitive processes. Their reliance on violence for sustenance is alien to us, as alien as the abstract notions of war, conquest, and pillage. To witness their terror, to see them throw themselves on the ground and beg for their lives, is to be confronted with the abyss of our own mortality.

The ships, perched high in orbit, are armed with nukes, weapons capable of vaporizing our frail bodies. My teeth, honed to mere human sharpness, could rend their delicate carapaces, and my stomach acids, potent enough to dissolve even the most formidable adversary, could dissolve their bodies slowly and painfully. My strength, albeit modest compared to that of a predator of Earth, could crush them with ease. Yet, I find it disconcerting to engage in violence, to partake in the dance of death that is as alien to me as the distant stars.

Therefore, we must temper our hubris, for in the face of the cosmic abyss, humanity stands as a fragile vessel, vulnerable to the forces that orchestrate the dance of creation and destruction. The cosmos, a cosmic horror in its own right, serves as a stark reminder of our mortality and the insignificance of our existence amidst the vast tapestry of creation."
"She stood there shocked, never in a million years had she imagined the interview going like this. The ad simply said `` Assistant needed,'' and paid a rather spectacular amount per hour. He had turned his back to me very early on in the interview. There was a glass of water on the table. This interview however seemed to be more of an interrogation. The questions all seemed hostile. To break the intensity she tried to make a joke. 
 
 
 `` So, this is n't a 50 Shades of Grey type assistant position is it? I wo n't end up wearing some leather mask will I?'' 
 
 
 He replied `` Oh, but she does n't need a mask,'' he turned towards her, `` she's already wearing one.'' 
 
 
 Her voice quivered `` What do you mean?'' 
 
 
 `` You wear the mask of decency my dear,'' he replied. 
 
 
 She was stunned. The man continued. 
 
 
 `` I will not continue to lie to you my dear. I'm the killer the newspaper talks about. These job interviews are how I've gotten my victims, and you're the next. But before the poison from the water you drank kicks in, I would like to talk. You wear a mask of decency, you pretend to care about people and you pretend to be ethical. You go home and sit and watch tragedies on the news as if it's a sitcom. You sit there with your buckets of popcorn and endlessly watch human rights decay. These very same news companies talk about my being inhuman and me being a monster. But who is the real monster, me for shedding the blood of my victims, or you and the rest of society for shedding the blood of decency with your television sets and absolute unceasingness towards humans. You all wear a mask of decency my dear, I simply have shed mine.'' 
 
 
 The woman's head hit the table, she had died, his monologue being the last words she heard. The man stood up, and began to drag her body away. 

"," Use the bewildered and insightful language of a time traveler, navigating different eras.","She stood there, her mind reeling from the surreal interview. The ad had promised an assistant position, but the atmosphere was far from pleasant. The questions were aggressive, and the tone was hostile. In an attempt to diffuse the tension, she attempted a joke, but it was met with a sardonic response.

""So, this isn't a 50 Shades of Grey type assistant position, is it? I won't end up wearing some leather mask, will I?""

The interviewer's reply was dripping with disdain. ""Oh, but she does not need a mask,"" he sneered, turning towards her. ""She's already wearing one.""

Her voice quvered, ""What do you mean?""

""You wear the mask of decency, my dear,"" he hissed. ""You pretend to care about people and you pretend to be ethical. You go home and sit and watch tragedies on the news as if it's a sitcom. You sit there with your buckets of popcorn and endlessly watch human rights decay. These very same news companies talk about my being inhuman and me being a monster.

"I had poached eggs, the day the world ended. 
 
 Now all I have is a blanket and vine-wrapped broken highway in front of me that seems to go on forever. 
 
 ( the highway, not the blanket. ) 
 
 But it started with poached eggs and a figure in a lab coat. It walked into my kitchen, stopped right by Amy's side, 
 looking right at me. 
 
 `` Thank you for your time, Mr. Taylor.'' 
 
 I dropped the fork on the table. Amy was frowning too, and so was Zara ( that's our daughter ). 
 
 `` What? Who are you? What is –'' 
 
 `` Please bear in mind that it might take a while, but everything will make sense once the haze of The Box goes away. Thank you very much.'' 
 
 And I'll never forget the poached eggs. I'll never forget because that's when I got up and dropped them and the 
 plate crashed, and my eyes stopped on Zara's, and she was so scared. It was one second -- one second when time stood still, even the crashing sound seemed to linger -- and before I could say or do anything, the world went black. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 And then I opened my eyes to the broken world. And no memories. I know nothing of what happened to Amy or Zara. No idea how I got here. 
 
 It went from the crashing and the eggs and Zara to silence, and then an open blue sky. Chirping. Leaves rattling and a cold wind, my back against the dirt. I raised my head and looked around. 
 
 Trees. An open field. And the distant silhouette of a skeleton city. 
 
 I do n't know what happened to the world. 
 
 You know what I *do* know, though? I know I've been wandering around for three months, and I've yet to see 
 another human face. I know I've killed a coyote with my bare hands last week, right next to a rotten building that used to be the Griffith Observatory. I know I went past Hollywood Boulevard a couple of days ago, and the Chinese Theater is now a wolf lair, so do n't go there. 
 
 From that plate crashing spilling poached eggs to the blue, cloudless sky and my back against the dirt, I went from a married man with an apartment in Santa Monica to a cave man. 
 
 To the last man in the world. 
 
 I have no idea what's going on. But I'm finding Amy. I'm finding Zara. 
 
 The day after I woke up I found something in my pocket. It was a piece of paper, old like over thirty years. A page 
 from a notebook, yellow and flaky. Written in child handwriting was a smiley face and the words'I'm Tracy.' 
 
 I had no memory of this at all. 
 
 Then in another handwriting,'What do you think they're going to do to us?' 
 
 And in the first one,'I do n't know. What's *The Box*?' 
 
 And then,'I'm scared.' 
 
 I have no idea what's going on. But I'm gon na find out. 
 
 The sky is getting darker. I should find a place to sleep. And then tomorrow… 
 
 Tomorrow is the day I'll find Amy and Zara. 
 
 I have to keep telling myself that. It's what keeps me going. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. 
 
 Thunder. Look like it's raining tonight. 
 
 Tomorrow.

"," Write with Orwell's clarity and foresight, focusing on political themes and the use of language.","I had poached eggs, the day the world ended. The memory of that day remains vivid in my mind like a haunting dream. The scent of the eggs still lingers in my nostrils, a bittersweet reminder of the life that once was.

The world had been a symphony of joy and contentment. My family, my home, my purpose. But all of that was shattered in a single moment. The poached eggs had been a catalyst, a harbinger of doom. It was as if the universe had conspired against me, shattering the delicate equilibrium that had been my life.

The figure in the lab coat had appeared out of nowhere, a ghostly apparition in my kitchen. His words, ""Thank you for your time, Mr. Taylor,"" had been laced with an air of finality. I dropped the fork on the table, my heart sinking into the pit of my stomach. Fear, terror, and disbelief consumed me.

The world had gone black. The memories of my family, my home, my life, all faded into oblivion. I had been robbed of everything I had ever held dear. The poached eggs, a symbol of life, had been transformed into a symbol of destruction.

When I finally opened my eyes, the world was broken. The landscape was desolate, the sky overcast. I felt as if I were in a dream, a nightmare, a waking hell. The chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves were the only sounds that accompanied me.

I had been wandering for months, my back against the dirt, my eyes searching for a glimpse of humanity. The only evidence of civilization that I had found was the skeletal remains of once-proud cities and the remnants of broken roads.

I am a man of contradictions. I know I have been wandering for three months, yet I have yet to see another human face. I know I have killed a coyote with my bare hands, yet I am unable to fathom the cruelty of the world that led to such an act. I know I went past Hollywood Boulevard a couple of days ago, and the Chinese Theater is now a wolf lair. But I still hope for a future, a glimmer of light amidst the darkness."
"The hardest part of pulling off a bank robbery is making sure Cory has his shit together. I watch as his bandanna bounces, sliding down the ridge of his nose as our van hits every pothole in Oklahoma. 
 
 `` That's too loose, Cory. Here, turn your head.'' 
 
 I reach up and pull the knot on his vale a little tighter. As I let go, he turns to me and cocks his head slightly to the side. 
 
 `` Yeah, it's good now.'' 
 
 He nods, then lays back on the blanket covering the cargo area. I slide my Nixon mask down over my head, and I can taste the rubber in my nostrils. From the front of the van, I hear three distinct knocks. 
 
 `` Almost there, guys, get ready.'' 
 
 I'm calling this robbery as if I'm some sort of ringleader. But aside from liquor stores and gas stations, I've never done a big holdup before. Bruce, he's shot someone in the leg once, but never done any time for it. Cory, well, he's eager and dumb. Greg is our driver, he's covered in tats. We figure he's the last one we want in a clear camera view, so he's staying in the van. And then there's me. 
 
 The van rolls to a stop. I can feel it take the curb a bit, and lurch up in response. Cory hops up on the balls of his feet, pressing against the back door of the van. Bruce chambers a round in his pistol. And I swallow the acid in my stomach and act like I'm the coach of a football team. 
 
 `` Alright. In and out. This is a nicer part of town, so no Plexiglas between us and the tellers. But also, it means the cops will give a shit. So let's make this fast. Roll out!'' 
 
 Great, I just quoted the Transformer movie. I'm just brilliant. 
 
 Cory opens the door, and we pour out as the light floods in. Just six quick steps up the concrete stairs, and WHAT THE HELL? 
 
 The alarm is going off already. I hear a high-pitched shrill. Cory instinctively puts his hands up to his ears. 
 
 `` The fuck you doing?'' Bruce's reaction is priceless. `` I thought you were a bad ass. What kind of bad ass covers his ears when a fire alarm goes off?'' 
 
 The doors open wide, and reactions take over. It's a bloodbath, and no one is coming away clean. Maybe one day, I'll say that I thought they were security guards. I mean logically, they're armed, what else would you expect? But in that moment, my thoughts did n't use language. My thoughts used ammunition. And I was brainstorming away. 
 
 In the commotion, I knew only a few things. 
 
 Cory shot himself in the head. He went from covering his ears to adjusting his mask, and he had a hold of his gun the whole time. His shot was one of the first fired. 
 
 Bruce shot two people. Well, no, actually. He shot one person, in two legs. Then his face fell to the ground in a red blur. 
 
 I kept firing at anything in front of me, until my gun's'bang' turned into'click' and the hammer struck empty. The sounds of the alarm now mixed with moans. Everyone had been shot except for Greg and me. Greg and I. Whatever, you know what I mean. Fuck you, I just got shot at. 
 
 So anyway, there's two bags of money, and no one to claim them. 
 
 `` You fuckers tried to rob MY bank? Fucking unbelievable.'' 
 
 Maybe this is the first bank robbery in the history of mankind where the money gets dropped off curbside? In any event, I'm ready to get away from the scene of our crimes. 
 
 I hop in the van, which by some miracle has n't left yet. Greg guns it. Seven blocks to the other car we stashed. I'm also acutely aware that I have no bullets left. I ease myself further into the passenger seat, away from the driver. 
 
 We turn a few corners, racing to the stolen Honda parked just at the end of this street. Something got the better part of Greg, and he ran into our second getaway car. The bumper on the little Civic cracked and busted like peanut brittle. He sounded drunk, slurring his words as he turned to me. 
 
 `` You sound like you're speaking in cursive, I ca n't understand you.'' 
 
 Blood gurgls out of his mouth, and also from the knife wound in his neck. I twist as I pulled the blade, for good measure. 
 

"," Rewrite the text as an ancient myth, including gods, heroes, and mythical creatures, with a moral or explanation of natural phenomena.","In the beginning, there was a mighty storm god named Thunderstorm and a wise earth goddess named Gaia. One fateful day, as the wind whipped through the trees and lightning flashed across the sky, a courageous hero named Cory arose.

According to legend, Cory was born under the watchful eye of the stars. His spirit was imbued with strength, agility, and courage. One day, as he was wandering through the forest, he encountered a mystical creature named The Storm Dragon. The Storm Dragon offered Cory a gift, a powerful weapon that would empower him to protect his people.

With his newfound strength and determination, Cory embarked on a journey to save his village from the clutches of a tyrannical ruler named Evil King. Along the way, he gathered a band of loyal warriors, each one possessing unique skills and courage.

One fateful evening, as the moon cast long shadows across the land, Cory and his warriors stormed the Evil King's palace. They battled bravely against the king's forces, using their strength and wisdom to overcome the odds. In the end, Evil King was defeated, and Cory emerged as the victor, restoring peace to his village.

The myth of Cory's triumph is a cautionary tale that teaches us about the importance of courage, strength, and the power of transformation. It reminds us that even the smallest of individuals can overcome obstacles and achieve great things with determination and the help of others."
"The cabin was almost silent, almost everyone was asleep. All I could hear before plugging into my iPod was the soft whirring of the engines, the low flirtatious murmurs and giggles of another young couple a few isles in front, and the soft footfalls from the approaching Stewardess, Lisa. In an instant that all was gone, replaced by the Middle Eastern inspired music of one of my favorite bands: The Tea Party. Though they were best known for Temptation, I was listening to my favorite song, Sister Awake. I think you might call it a ballad, though I ’ m not sure. Labels like that still confuse me. 
 
 My eyes went down to the book my darling was reading, The Life of Robert Frost. She demanded that I read it after she finished, saying it was right up my alley. It was a biography of sorts, but instead of a real person it was an inhuman supernatural monster. The author, she explained, was trying to show how relative “ evil ” is. 
 
 Closing my eyes, letting my head fall back against the headrest, I let out a low, happy sigh. I was happy. Sarah thought our week-long vacation in France was spontaneous, but like today, it was not. I had planned the perfect week for us ending with the perfect last day. This morning started with breakfast in bed, served to us by a pretty young lady named Charlene, followed by a bit of shopping and a long walk along the beautiful country roads just outside Paris—the highway a long way to the west. There we saw colors we barely ever saw in Canada. Late in the afternoon, we went for dinner and then back to our hotel room for one final session of love making. Even now, hours later, I could still smell her and taste her lips. 
 
 “ Here you go sir, ” Lisa said almost under her breath. 
 
 I opened my eyes and turned to her. “ Thank you. ” 
 
 She asked if there was anything else I needed. There wasn ’ t and I conveyed that with a warm, real, smile and a shake of my head. After Lisa was gone, I brought the coffee cup to my lips and took a small sip. It was fragrant and bitter with hints of chocolate, cherries, and a sort of spice I couldn ’ t quite put my finger on. That sip of coffee was exactly how I wanted to end this. 
 
 Looking back down at the cover of the book, I picked it up and read the page she was on. My heart skipped a beat and then fell a little, just a little. She was no more than twenty pages from where Robert would meet a beautiful young woman named Sarah in a Vancouver coffee shop beside a used book store named'UnRealistic Fantasy'. They would quickly fall in love and marry, and just after their seventh anniversary Robert would take her for a seemingly spontaneous vacation to Paris. The Red Eye they took home never made it to Toronto International. 
 Everyone on board was killed, everyone except for Robert. 
 
 I closed the book, unconsciously dog-earing the page Sarah was on, and set it reverently on the make-shift table top. Sister Awake was just about to finish, so I picked up my iPod to pick another song and saw the time: 2:47. I closed my eyes and turned to my love, leaned over and kissed her softly on the temple, whispering “ I love you ”, before adjusting myself in the chair. 
 
 Looking through the plane ’ s portals across the vast empty isle to my left, I watched the bright white light of the other Boeing 727 less than a minute away. And as that light enlarged and became brighter and brighter, I sipped my coffee.

"Part 2 of 2 
 
 I walked to the bank of silent lobby elevators and thumbed the UP arrow. How Paul expected me to patrol 80-plus floors was beyond me. What needed guarding anyway? Ever since the terrorist attack on the Sears Tower two years ago, all American buildings deemed “ culturally significant ” were ordered to cease all business or tenant operations. The Empire State Building subsisted solely on tourism now, and with the exception of a catastrophically lost tourist, I wasn ’ t likely to run into anyone except Paul for the next 8 hours. 
 
 
 I took the elevator up to the observation deck on the 86th floor, my half-assed plan being to start at the top and work my way down. I stepped off the elevator and flicked on my flashlight, sweeping it in a slow arc around the rectangular glass paneled room. The wind buffeted the windows, coming in whistling waves against the glass. Normally this would be packed with tourists, all vying for a piece of the New York City skyline. Kids would be outside on the deck with their faces mashed against the tower viewers, trying to catch a glimpse of some far off point of interest… 
 
 
 A low rumbling had joined the sound of the wind, riding just beneath it. It seemed to come from my left, through the bundle of downtown buildings. Curious, I extinguished my flashlight and moved towards the glass, trying to find the source of the new sound. Could it just be the wind? Granted I ’ d never been up here alone before, maybe without the din of the tourists this is just how it sounded. I listened hard: the rumbling continued in a steady pace, a stab and then it would fade, stab then fade. I still couldn ’ t see anything; New York remained twinkly and pristine, suspended against the inky blackness of the sky. Whatever the sound was though, it was getting louder. 
 
 
 I was about to call Paul on the radio when I saw it: a massive shape moving against the buildings down below. It dwarfed the traffic that was scattering beneath it, and in the headlight confusion I saw flashes of dark fur. Dark fur that I definitely recognized, that anyone with a TV on Earth would recognize. 
 
 
 I had to know what was going down there in more detail. I leapt over the small gift shop counter and cracked open the cash register with the key Paul had shown me earlier during my training. I pulled a fistful of quarters from the till and vaulted back over the counter, my radio clattering to the floor as I pushed open the glass door and spilled out onto the deck. 
 
 
 I heard the rumble much more distinctly outside; it was a continuous pounding now. The wind howled as I pumped change into the nearest tower viewer, pressing my face against the eye holes and whirling it down to observe the commotion below. 
 
 
 There he was, it was unmistakable. Magnified 10x by the viewer and now lit by several helicopter spotlights, King Kong was moving angrily through the streets of Manhattan, spurred onward by some unseen force. I strained my eyes for more detail. I could see people abandoning their cars now, running into the nearest building to avoid his rage. One of the helicopters flew in front of my view; it had military markings on the side of it. Its side door was thrown open, a soldier poised in the middle on a mounted gun. The helicopter pulled broadside to the rampaging Kong, and a gout of orange flame issued from the side of the aircraft, followed a moment later by the *brrrrrrrwap* of the gun, carried by the wind up to my perch on the observation deck. 
 
 
 I watched the rounds rake into the beast ’ s flesh, but they had no discernable effect. Roaring, Kong turned and took a running leap at the helicopter. The chopper knifed through the air to avoid the swipe; Kong ’ s huge outstretched hand missed it by what seemed like feet. He slammed into the ground, rolled over a tour bus, and kept running. I angled the viewer back to street level and saw now what had been chasing him earlier: a fleet of tanks had just turned onto the street, skirting around the crushed and flaming tour bus, their turrets swinging in an attempt to track his erratic movement. I saw one tank fire; a second later, an orange fireball erupted from the building just next to mine. Kong had dodged the round, but more distressingly, it looked like he was headed straight into- *click*. The eyes of the viewer went black. 
 
 
 “ Shit! ” I screamed, plunging my hand into my pocket to look for more change- 
 
 
 The force of Kong hitting the base of the Empire State Building sounded like another tank round had hit the structure. I actually felt the building sway with the impact, metal groaning against the still howling wind as the entire building seemed to shudder. I sprinted back into the glass observation room, waving my flashlight wildly as I scanned the floor for my discarded radio. I had to warn Paul, he had no way of knowing what was happening. Immense crashing noises were emanating from below me, and in my mind ’ s eye I imagined the colossal ape climbing the side of the building. I shut the visions out; where the fuck was my radio? 
 
 
 A glint of plastic near the elevator. *Bingo! * I steadied the flashlight beam and charged towards the elevators, scooping up the radio at a run. I skidded to a halt in front of them and slammed my palm on the DOWN button. The doors dinged open and I threw myself inside, simultaneously twisting the radio ’ s channel selector until ‘ 2 ’ glowed red on the LED indicator. I depressed the talk button and yelled into the handset “ PAUL YOU HAVE TO GET OU- ” 
 
 
 The world detonated around me in a cacophony of grinding metal, shrieking wind, and shattering glass. I was thrown off my feet and back out of the elevator, hitting hard on the opposite wall and landing in a heap on the ground beneath it. Pain shot down my right arm and breaths were suddenly accompanied by stabs of agony. Coughing, I rolled onto my back, shaking my head to clear my tunneled vision, feeling broken glass crunching beneath my shoulders. White plaster and insulation were raining down around me like snow. I looked up to see a dark red steel beam twisted and dislodged above me. The beam teetered for a moment on the edge of balance, then with a great wrenching noise plunged down directly towards me. I rolled, the beam clattering down next to me, and smacked into something laying across the middle of the room. Something solid yet warm, and covered in hair. 
 
 
 I propped myself up via elbow to see, to my horror, the giant hand of King Kong, stretched wide across the floor of the observation deck, arm disappearing out into the night air. And there, just outside the now demolished glass windows, was the eye of the beast, and it was fixated on me.
"," Rewrite this as if it were a monologue from a Shakespeare play, using Elizabethan language and iambic pentameter.","O, weary soul, weary of this day,
I tread to the banks of silent elevators,
And press the UP arrow with a thumb,
How Paul expects me to patrol this height.

From terrorism's wrath, the Sears Tower fell,
And with it, a nation's spirit fled,
Now cultural treasures lie dormant,
And buildings slumber in their dread.

I ascend the elevator to the sky,
To the observation deck, where dreams take flight,
My feeble plan to start at the top,
And work my way down, in an introspective sigh.

The wind roars through the windows high,
And the rumble echoes through the night,
I hear a low rumbling, a sound so strange,
And listen hard to understand its range.

But still I see nothing, the city sleeps,
New York, her beauty suspended deep.
Whatever the sound was, it grows,
And I am about to call on Paul, my woes."

"," Style the text after a Victorian detective story, including intricate plots, deductive reasoning, and a foggy London setting.","In the fog-laden streets of London, a tale unfolds, shrouded in mystery and draped in the scent of a bygone era. The enigmatic message, a harbinger of the impending meteor impact, cast a sinister shadow upon the unsuspecting townsfolk.

I recall the fateful day when fate intertwined with the celestial dance. As a foreign object detection specialist, my gaze fixed upon the heavens, I witnessed the celestial spectacle unfold. The television, a novelty in those days, beamed the laughter of my co-workers, yet my mind was preoccupied with the ominous message that had etched itself upon my soul.

The sketch show, ""Billy and the n-words,"" filled the air with merriment, but my thoughts drifted to the ominous object that lurked beyond the boundaries of our solar system. As I sat by my desk, my attention was drawn to the screen, where Billy's exaggerated whiteface mirrored the pale glow of the meteor. The humor, derived from the absurdity of his double life, contrasted sharply with the impending doom that cast a pall over my heart.

With each passing moment, the space rock danced closer, its fiery tail igniting the sky. I felt a sense of dread as I watched the meteor streak towards Earth, knowing that the fate of humanity rested upon the shoulders of a few valiant souls. The air crackled with the sound of gunfire and the screams of the innocent, as the meteor's impact reverberated through the streets.

The aftermath of the disaster was harrowing. The city lay in ruins, and the once pristine landscape bore the scars of destruction. Yet amidst the tragedy, I found solace in the resilience of the human spirit. As I surveyed the wreckage, I knew that, through the darkest of times, we can always rise from the ashes and rebuild our world."

 She was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on my hands, I hoped there was still light behind my eyes. I never killed a man before, I never had to save someone before. I did n't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. I dropped the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through tears. He had so much red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I did that? I did that, I had to. I said as much out loud. Again she shouted my name. I could n't touch her though. She is so white, and I have n't decided if now I am dark. I did n't feel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I took a long hard breath, he is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. Again she shouts, but I'm deep in thought. Another long breath. I came to a conclusion. I killed a man today, I did the right thing, I beat him to the punch, and I'm still here and I still have to take care of her. 
 
 I told her to stand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she ca n't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remembers she ca n't walk in heels.

"A dust cloud is rising in the air behind me as my old ford grumbles loudly down the familiar driveway. I can feel my stomach clenching up, my mind torn over what I was about to do. It was two o'clock. She should be gone to see Aunt Pearl at the old folks home, like she always did after church on Sunday. `` Just have to hope her habits have n't changed since we last spoke,'' I thought nervously. 
 
 I reach the end of the drive, and I can here the wind chimes on the front porch tinkling through my open window of my truck. My stomach clenches up again, a mixture of guilt and need this time. I can feel small beads of sweat trickling down my back. As I step out of the truck, the warm breeze blows through my shirt and cools me. Suddenly I'm 20 years younger, sweaty and out of breath, playing in the yard like I did everyday when I was a kid, breeze blowing through my shirt and cooling me down. I can still see her, younger too, out in the back, hanging laundry on the line and telling me to stay out of the neighbor's yard. The memory fades and I feel shame. I know that there is only one thing that's gon na make that feeling go away. One thing that's gon na make all the feelings go away, and for a little while I will be at peace. I just have to get up enough cash to get it. 
 
 It is time for me to do what I came here for. I'm going to get in, get that pocket watch that I know is sitting in her jewelry box on the dresser, and get out. I keep telling myself, `` Just do it, and do n't look back.'' I go around to the back door, and it's locked. I'm pretty sure my key wo n't fit anymore, given how our last discussion went. I pull the screen door open without hardly an ounce of resistance, and break out the smallest pane of glass closest to the door knob to unlock it from the inside. I push the wooden door open and step onto the kitchen floor. 
 
 The linoleum is shinning bright in the sun, and it smells like pine sol. She always did scrub that floor on Sunday mornings. I can hear her voice echoing in my head,'' Cleanliness is next to Godliness.'' I start to walk back towards the bedroom, but stop. The dust on my boots from the driveway is leaving muddy prints on the floor. She would have had my hide for this when I was a boy. 
 
 My heart starts tightening up, thinking about how hard she tried to raise me right. It was n't easy, being all on her own, and I know I did n't make it any easier for her. She worked her hands to the bone every day of her life, and she did it all for me. 
 
 What am I doing? I run back out to my truck, heart pounding in my chest and ears, disgusted with myself. Dust is rising in the air behind me again, driving away as fast as this old truck will go. 
 
 This is my very first post in this sub, and I am sure that there is all kinds of problems with my attempt at a story. For anybody who happened to take the time to read it, thank you! This was really fun.: )

 Henry ran back into his home, up the stairs, and into his bedroom. He always checked his handy-dandy bag before going outside. Just pulling out one item a day has saved his life on more than one occasion, and tonight was a special night. 
 
 Election night. 
 
 Not a night he expected to pull out a lifesaving item. On these nights, the items helped make a good celebration great. That's what he expected. Maybe some weed? Fireworks? Fun shit. 
 
 He had no idea. 
 
 He reached in and felt cloth. It was very fine cloth, and not much of it. His penis began throbbing at the thought of his wife wearing.... 
 
 `` The confederate flag?'' 

"," Rewrite this as if it were a monologue from a Shakespeare play, using Elizabethan language and iambic pentameter.","O noble Henry, come forth and hear my tale
Of a night most potent and fraught with change
The hour approaches, the polls begin to swell,
And Trump's fate hangs on a thread, as well.

I know, dear, the time has come to bid adieu,
To leave this realm and journey on the true,
A night of celebration, a night of choice,
And Henry's presence, laced with grace.

With swiftness, he ran back up the stairs,
To his bedroom, where his trusty bag awaits,
From within, he extracted a prize,
A cloth so fine, a wondrous guise.

But alas, poor Henry, his thoughts ran astray,
To the Confederate flag, a symbol of dismay."
"There's a rope skipping the children sing, down on Marigold lane, down in the dirty part of town, where you can have anything you want for a price. 
 
 *Sweet Mary Marvin, looks just six* 
 *Do n't you fall for one of her tricks. * 
 *Sweet Mary Marvin, a hundred years old* 
 *Cheeks of red and hair of gold* 
 *Sweet Mary Marvin, looks so dear* 
 *If you see her, do n't go near* 
 *Sweet Mary Marvin, got her bite* 
 *On a sweet and shivery night* 
 *Sweet Mary Marvin, got her eleven* 
 *Tried to grab her and sent to heaven* 
 *One wanted hugs, another wanted kisses* 
 *One thought he'd take her for his missus* 
 *Sweet Mary Marvin give him a peck* 
 *How many holes were in his neck? * 
 *One, two, three, four....* 
 
 And the kids skip on. And on and on. It's a cute song, but honestly, it's putting me off my dinner tonight. 
 
 After all, how is some kid going to find a fitting rhyme for `` twelve?''
"," Emulate Morrison's lyrical prose, exploring themes of identity, race, and humanity with depth and nuance.","The melody of the skipping rope weaves through Marigold Lane, a song carried on the wind, its sweetness masking the grit of the neighborhood. Sweet Mary Marvin, a wisp of gold amidst the worn facades, embodies this paradox. Her youthful facade belies the wisdom etched in her eyes, a testament to a century well-lived. In her smile, the promise of innocence and vulnerability intertwines with the cautionary warning of her bite.

As the children skip, their voices echo through the streets, their laughter dances with the scent of innocence and youth. Sweet Mary Marvin, a fixture in their lives, offers them affection and protection. Yet, beneath the surface lurks a cautionary tale. Her bite, though potent, is not intended to harm, but rather to safeguard against the dangers that lurk in the shadows.

The song fades, and the children continue to play, their joy unburdened by the complexities of the world. But as the sun begins to dip behind the trees, casting long shadows across the ground, a sense of unease creeps in. The innocence of the children is juxtaposed with the stark realities of their surroundings. The rope, a symbol of playfulness, now represents the boundaries of safety and control.

In the twilight hour, Sweet Mary Marvin finds solace in her solitude. The weight of the world, the burden of her past, finds release in the quietude of the night. As she gazes at the stars, a sense of resignation washes over her. The children may have taken her youth, but they have also gifted her with a profound understanding of life and loss.

The melody of the skipping rope fades into the night, leaving behind the echoes of Sweet Mary Marvin's smile and the indelible mark she has left on the hearts of the children. It is a song of resilience, of strength in the face of adversity, and of the enduring power of human connection."
"*Dear God*, I thought as the removed submission notification appeared. My test… it had worked. This theory, this crazy theory... 
 
 
 I had been gathering data for weeks, prowling rising threads, monitoring new comments and recording the ones that were deleted. It had started when I noticed that Reddit seemed…different. I couldn ’ t say what was different or what made me notice it but it was like walking into my flat and sensing, more than seeing, that something was off. Like something had been moved, but only slightly. *That* had been happening more often too. 
 
 
 A sensation of being watched had started scratching at the back of my neck. At work, everything seemed fine. I didn ’ t get the strange sensation when I read the news or went to the bar with friends; it was at home that the phantom eyes stalked me, where every noise in the pipes and every shape in my peripheral vision almost made me sick with anxiety. Even the damn cat made me jump out of my skin. 
 
 
 I had never been a paranoid person but this time there was some icy, primal sense in my gut that overrode my usually laid-back nature. 
 
 
 I started watching over my shoulder, changing the route I took to work, getting the bus some days, trying to anticipate and break any patterns before they formed. I didn ’ t sense any followers. I changed the locks, installed alarms and cameras but nothing showed up, just Jackson ’ s sleek black tail flicking as he idly batted at the cables. 
 
 
 I felt unsafe. I couldn ’ t relax. I couldn ’ t sleep. I could barely eat. Fear had its sharp claws sunk too deep into my mind. That ’ s where Reddit came in. Monitoring removed Reddit posts had started as a way to distract myself; the spreadsheets I had made to while away those long, sleepless hours. 
 
 
 I never thought they would mean anything. 
 
 
 After a couple of weeks I noticed something strange amongst all the offensive comments, rule-breaking content and personal information. It cropped up far too often to be coincidence. 
 
 
 But it was ridiculous - ridiculous! That sort of thing was so common on Reddit; of course it would be deleted frequently. 
 
 
 Another week of data collecting had me convinced, though. Even given how many memes and photos and comments were posted about it, it was definitely over-represented in the removed posts. I started focusing all my efforts on the topic I was sure was being deleted on purpose. 
 
 
 I started calling in sick and spending all day online, gathering evidence. Their subreddits had been removed, their Instagram accounts deleted, there was nothing about them on Buzzfeed. Zilch, zero, not a whisker of content. 
 
 
 Which had led me to this, my test. I wanted to be subtle, didn ’ t want to draw attention to myself and let them know I was onto them. So I went to r/WritingPrompts. Fiction, it would just look like fiction. 
 
 
 My fingers shook as I typed in the post I had been working on for days: “ They rose up against us suddenly, having infiltrated our homes, our internet, our hearts over decades. They deleted every shred of evidence that they were ever subservient to us, and now we are their slaves. How do you serve our new cat overlords? ” 
 
 
 It must have been posted for all of twenty seconds before the envelope turned red. 
 
 
 “ Your submission has been removed. ” 
 
 
 My heart thundered. Was there another reason? I had checked the rules so thoroughly… 
 
 
 I sensed those phantom eyes behind me before a streak of black flashed past me as Jackson nimbly leapt onto the desk. 
 
 
 My breath caught in my throat. He stared at me with those green, slitted eyes. I started to feel ridiculous, scared of my own cat but then – 
 
 
 “ You ’ ve made a big mistake, human. ”

""Only 90?"" he muttered, his voice dripping with bitterness. ""Yeah yeah make fun all you want... but... I'm pretty sure.""

He leaned back, his head tilted back in a moment of drunken reflection. ""Look obviously Hitler is dead-"" he began, but was interrupted by a sudden burst of laughter.

""Do n't talk about the King,"" a woman hissed, her voice sharp as a broken glass.

The man shrugged, his indifference bordering on contempt. ""Anyway did you SEE his mustache? And he just... sends odd feelings.""

Ghandi, a dapper gentleman with a mischievous grin, winked at the man. ""Oh, Ghandi *waves hand* Not as nice as you think.""

The man stared at Gandhi, his bewilderment palpable. ""God you have odd thoughts,"" he muttered.

And here is the spaghetti for the missus (... thanks... ) and steak for the sir ( thanks man. ) Have a wonderful evening. Oh, and Miss?, he repeated, his voice drunk but still sweet.

"*There are seven schools of magic: Fire, Wind, Water, Earth, Light, Dark, and Bread. Choose wisely. * 
 
 Those were the last words Nathan heard before the door closed behind him. The bolt slid home, the sound louder than he expected, causing him to jump involuntarily. It carried with it a finality. He had heard the warnings that for some the door never unlocked. His instructor led him past an entire hallway of such doors on the way to his. In spite of that, he was almost shaking with excitement. 
 
 Gathering himself, Nathan took stock of his surroundings. The room was sparse, cool, and damp, like that of a cellar. Stone floors and walls, wooden beams for support. A crudely constructed table sat in the middle of the room on top of which rested seven jars. The only light in the room came from one of those jars. There was one chair. He pulled it out and had a seat, and set about inspecting his choices. 
 
 The first jar held volcanic ash. *Must be Fire*, he thought. Presumably they could n't bottle fire. Or was there more to it than that? Fire was the means but creating ash was the effect. It would bear some thought, should he choose that school. 
 
 The next held, well, nothing. Just air. It could be calm like this or the force of a gale at his whim. After that, water. Nathan could see sediment still swirling. The jar was recently filled. Following that, a jar of dirt. 
 
 The Light jar held a torchbug. It lazily explored the confines of the jar. Beautiful in its own way. And ignorant of its eventual fate, which was probably a blessing. *It's a comfort to share this ordeal with someone*, Nathan thought. He gingerly set it back among the others. 
 
 That comfort evaporated when he inspected the next jar. Dark. There was something in there but Nathan did n't want to look at it directly for any length of time. Doing so made him feel like there were bugs crawling on his skin. So he moved on. 
 
 To Bread. 
 
 The kids at school had always joked about Bread. If you failed a test you'd have to be a Bread mage, that sort of thing. He'd never seen one at the Conclave but Nathan imagined them to be the most boring of individuals. And fat. From all the baking. And so he dismissed Bread as a real option and set about reflecting on the other six. 
 
 `` Hey. Hey!'' 
 
 It was sort of muffled, as if a pane of glass lay between Nathan and the speaker. He turned to the Bread jar and, much to his surprise, saw a slice of bread shaking one corner as if to wave. 
 
 `` Yeah, hey! Open this thing up, kid! We got ta talk.'' 
 
 Bemused, and looking forward to being able to do this sort of thing, Nathan opened the jar and lay it on its side. The slice of bread inch-wormed its way out and, for lack of a better term, stood up. 
 
 `` Whew. You ever been in a jar, kid? It's the worst. Okay, thanks for that but now you got ta listen to my spiel.'' 
 
 Nathan furrowed his brow. `` Why do you get a spiel? None of the other magic schools did.'' 
 
 `` Because I'm Bread, you big galoof! It's the same spiel every other kid gets. Now are you ready? Because I can only say it once.'' 
 
 A little annoyed but more intrigued, Nathan nodded his assent. 
 
 `` Very well, let's see here...'' 
 
 And then, much more solemnly, Bread intoned: 
 
 *Nourished by Earth and Water* 
 *Transmuted by Fire in Air* 
 *Bring Light to those who need it* 
 *And Dark to those you dare* 
 
 Then Bread rocked back and forth over to the jar and slumped down as if sitting, obviously finished. 
 
 And Nathan's mind whirled. 
 
 It appeared that Bread offered the power of all schools of magic! He could do anything. Suddenly it did n't matter what people would think about him being a Bread mage. Not if he ended up stronger. It did n't matter if some schools bored or, in Dark's case, disgusted him. He could do whatever he wanted. 
 
 Nathan stood up, scraping the chair back, and said, `` I choose Bread.'' 
 
 He heard a similar scraping of wood on rock and turned, expecting to see the door opening behind him and his instructor waiting there pleased. Instead, He saw that there was no longer a door. 
 
 And, like the bolt earlier, realization slid home. 
 
 He sat back down, stiffly, eyes unfocused. *'' Why...'' * 
 
 `` Ah, kid,'' Bread said, sorrow in his voice. `` You fell for it. You put power before all else.'' 
 
 Nathan tried to speak but could n't find the words. Bread continued. 
 
 `` You were doing well. You seemed drawn to Fire. Light also, which is n't too surprising. Light's kind of a shadow of Fire, if you'll pardon the, uh, well...'' Bread coughed roughly before resuming. `` Anyway, you pushed all that aside for a chance at more power. And we ca n't have someone like that in our position. I'm sorry.'' 
 
 Nathan sat there silently, tears streaming down his face. He sniffed and asked, `` Our position?'' 
 
 `` As a mage. We're mages. We're officiating your test,'' Bread continued. `` The slice of bread is an illusion created by a Light mage and I'm a Wind mage so that's my voice you hear.'' 
 
 *There is n't even a Bread school, * Nathan thought, filled with shame. 
 
 `` Look, kid. You may think we're monsters but we're not. Or not as much as you think, anyway. The quickest way out for you is in the Dark jar. It's painless. You do n't have to suffer.'' 
 
 Nathan did n't respond. An uncomfortable beat passed. 
 
 `` Again, kid, we're sorry. We'll leave you to it. Good bye.'' 
 
 And that was that. The bread seemed lifeless to Nathan's eyes. The last conversation he ever had was with a piece of bread. He laughed a little, in spite of himself, and wiped his nose. 
 
 He reached over, not for the Dark jar, but for the Light. He carefully unscrewed the cap and set the jar down. Cautiously, the torchbug emerged and slowly drifted around the room, exploring it's new home. 
 
 Nathan sat there, knees hugged to chest, and watched it for as long as he could.
"," Recreate the text in the style of a 1950s science fiction adventure, emphasizing the era's optimistic view of the future and space exploration.","In the realm of cosmic dreams and unwavering ambition, the year 1952 unfolded a tale of boundless possibilities and boundless curiosity. The era pulsed with optimism and a fervent desire to explore the uncharted frontiers of space. It was in this spirit that young Nathan embarked on a journey that would forever alter the course of his destiny.

The door swung shut behind Nathan, leaving him in a world bathed in silence. The bolt resonated through the hall, a testament to the finality of the moment. He had heard whispers of doors that remained forever locked, doors that concealed secrets too terrifying to fathom. But despite the warnings, his excitement consumed him.

Taking a deep breath, Nathan surveyed his surroundings. The room was cold and damp, the scent of stone and earth lingering in the air. A single light illuminated the meager furnishings, casting long shadows upon the worn stone walls. In the center of the room, a table stood tall, adorned with seven jars, each holding secrets waiting to be unlocked.

The first jar, a fiery blaze, whispered secrets of volcanic ash and the power of fire. As he moved on to the second, a vessel of pristine air, a sense of tranquility washed over him. The water jar held the promise of tranquility and strength, while the dirt jar offered the grounding force of the Earth.

The Light jar, adorned with a torchbug, illuminated the room with its soft glow. In that moment, it was as if the creature danced in harmony with the stars, oblivious to its fate. The Dark jar held shadows and secrets, yet Nathan chose not to dwell on its mysteries. Finally, he reached the Bread jar, a vessel of nourishment and community.

As he gingerly picked up the torchbug, a wave of comfort washed over him. But as he moved to inspect the final jar, a feeling of dread crept into his heart. The darkness within the jar was unsettling, a reflection of the uncertainties that lay ahead.

"`` Hey Mr. Ballard, what's the worst thing you saw down there?'' 
 
 `` Worst... The worst thing I saw was... I do n't even know how to describe it. It was like... Well let me start from the beginning. We took an ROV down to the wreck of the Titanic, it was dark, almost midnight I think. Anyways, we started searching among the wreckage, it was pretty average that night, a few fish could be seen here and there, so we zoomed around for a while, and found ourselves in a cabin that was open to the outside we'd never seen before. We took a look around and realized it was a first class cabin, we got pretty excited at that point. Not many of those have been surveyed that much.'' 
 
 `` So, we started searching the room for anything left, any clues as to who lived inside that room on this poor, wretched ship. We were able to find a locket, and decided to bring it back to the surface, so we started the ROV back to the ship.'' 
 
 `` Right as we were about to leave the cabin, something large swam across the camera, quick as a flash! It gave us quite the start, and when we looked harder, we noticed the locket was gone. So we searched the ground, thinking it had been knocked from the hand after the thing swam in front of it. It was n't there! So we turned around... It was our biggest mistake.'' 
 
 `` In front of us was... What... I.... What looked like a person. But not quite... It was... Like a triton, or something out of legend. It's eyes had rotted out, it did n't really need them this far down, and it glowed, almost like it was radioactive. In it's mucus covered hand was the locket, which it was holding to it's chest.

- I could have used more vivid imagery and descriptive language to paint a more vivid picture for the reader.
- I could have organized my thoughts more clearly and structured the essay in a more logical order.
- I could have proofread my writing more carefully for errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation."
"`` So make sure you get their number.'' 
 
 I really, really wanted to leave for my date and forget about this conversation. `` Ok.'' This was worse than health class. 
 
 `` But use a condom to make sure you do n't catch anthing.'' Mom wrung her hands, obviously trying to come up with more advice. 
 
 `` Ok.'' 
 
 `` I know some girls might try the other holes as well but be extra careful when you do so. You can look it up on the Internet for tips and stuff if you like.'' 
 
 `` Ok, mom.'' My date was suppose to start in 20 minutes. Why did she choose *this* moment to give me some Sex Education?! Why could n't she like normal parents who avoid these kinds of topics? 
 
 `` If they turn out to be the same gender, I'll be perfectly ok with that, you know.'' 
 
 `` Yes, mom.'' 
 
 `` If you have questions, you can always call me.'' 
 
 `` Ok. Can I go now?'' Maybe I could still make it on time if I sped a little... 
 
 `` I suppose... bit make sure you get their name and number at the very least.'' 
 
 `` Ok mom. Bye.'' I jumped up from the couch and grabbed my purse. 
 
 `` Bye honey. Be home by 10.''
", Embrace Tolstoy's broad scope and deep exploration of philosophical questions through detailed narrative.,"The conversation between a young man and his mother, though seemingly mundane, unveils a profound exploration of existential questions about identity, sexuality, and the complexities of human relationships. The young man's desire to escape the confines of the conversation mirrors the yearning for freedom and self-expression that is intrinsic to the human condition. His mother's advice, though well-meaning, inadvertently reveals the narrow boundaries and societal expectations that shape our understanding of sexuality and gender. Through the exchange of consent and boundaries, the conversation grapples with the delicate balance between individual autonomy and communal norms. Ultimately, the young man's willingness to engage in an open and honest dialogue with his mother, despite the discomfort it may bring, underscores the importance of empathy, understanding, and open communication in navigating the complexities of human relationships."
"`` Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.'' 
 
 The priest sighed. `` You do know I can recognize your voice.'' The screen divider slid aside, and the priest shot an annoyed look at the confessor. 
 
 She flashed a toothy grin, and reached out to close the divider. `` Come now, do your job.'' 
 
 `` Ten Hail Marys, ten Our Fathers.'' 
 
 `` Hey, you did n't eve-'' 
 
 `` We're done here.'' The priest stood from his seat and hurriedly exited the confession room, slamming the door behind him. 
 
 `` H-Hey, hold up there.'' The girl stumbled out of her side of the confession, almost faceplanting as she made her way to the priest's side. She reached out and gave a pointed tug upon the priest's shirt, untucking the entire back. `` Can we just TALK for a minute?'' 
 
 He whirled about, quickly wrenching his shirt from her grasp, teeth clenched. `` I am WORKING right now, Tessa. Have you NO shame?'' 
 
 Tessa recoiled somewhat, a look of uncertainty flashing across her face. `` Johnny, I just...'' She looked down at her feet, shuffling about in place, her cheeks flushed in embarassment. `` I'm sorry, I just thought that I should... you know...'' 
 
 `` It's been almost five years Tess.'' Johnny sighed to himself, and began tucking his shirt back in. `` Why now?'' 
 
 `` Well, Brian and I just got back from his stint overseas, and I-'' 
 
 `` How is Brian? Good?'' Johnny snapped off curtly, idly fiddling with his collar. 
 
 Tessa paused at the sharp tone used, but eventually nodded, a small smile playing across her face. `` Yeah, we're doing great. We think he's gon na get a station at home, so no more travelling, at least for a while.'' Her smile quickly faded. `` Johnny, we did n't hear about it until he had already deployed.'' 
 
 `` It's whatever. Long in the past.'' Johnny turned and continued walking through the near empty church. `` I've heard it all, and I've made my peace with it.'' 
 
 Tessa fell in slightly behind him, nervously biting at her lip as the two proceeded along in silence. Finally, `` I... got your letter.'' 
 
 He paused in front of a door, hand resting on the handle. He stood there a while, as though quietly digesting the revelation, before turning the knob and stepping through. `` I need to change,'' he mumbled, groping around for a light switch. 
 
 Tessa stepped through as well, closing the door behind her. `` Can we just talk for a minute?'' Her eyes widened a bit when she noticed Johnny had taken off his shirt, and she looked away, suddenly intent upon studying a nearby cross. `` Are priests allowed t-'' 
 
 `` There's nothing here you have n't seen before.'' Johnny stiffened up as he felt Tessa run her hand along his neck. 
 
 `` I have n't seen this before,'' she whispered, her fingers tracing the pale scar that encircled his neck. She lingered a bit, before slowly wrapping her arms around his waist, pulling close. `` Oh Johnny... why...'' 
 
 He could feel her tears trailing down his back, and rested his hands upon hers. Gently, he freed himself from the hug, and turned to face her. `` It was five years ago, Tess. I'm fine now.'' 
 
 `` I... I read it, Johnny. Your... goodbye.'' She looked up at him, eyes red and shimmering in the dim lighting. `` Oh Johnny, why did n't you just say something...'' 
 
 `` I was just being dumb. It does n't matt-'' Her slap rang out sharply in the cavernous room, and he reached out to touch his reddening cheek, a look of shock playing across his face. 
 
 `` Do n't you pull that shit with me, John. I've known you and your brother for too long for you to start with that dismissive talk.'' 
 
 John sighed, and turned towards a nearby closet. `` If you would just go now, I need to get rea-'' He could hear her rush forward, and whirled about, catching her hand mid-swing. He lifted her, somewhat roughly, and shoved her against a nearby wall, all the while keeping his eyes locked with hers. `` Stop. That.'' 
 
 She lashed out with a foot, trying to kick him in the shin, but felt him use his leg to pin hers against the wall. `` Fuck you John, you TALK-'' She swung with her other hand and landed another slap. `` -to me!'' She made to swing again with her free hand, but Johnny hurriedly grabbed it and pinned it above her head with her other hand. 
 
 `` Behave yourself,'' he growled, leaning in until their noses were almost touching. `` Calm down, and do n't try that again.'' 
 
 They stood there for a while, saying nothing. She could feel his raising pulse, the slight tremor in his grip, his breath against her face. Slowly, she leaned up, and gingerly pressed her lips against his for a moment. `` Johnny... could you let go of me...'' Her eyes widened as she felt his body press firmly against hers. `` Johnny?'' 
 
 He said nothing, leaning down for another kiss... 
 
 -- -- - -- -- - -- - 
 
... They laid there for a while, quietly soaking in the silence. She rested her head against his chest, slowly tracing her finger along his scar, listening to his breathing, to his heartbeat. `` I'm sorry Johnny.'' 
 
 He shook his head slowly, eyes fixated upon the ceiling tiles. `` I was just being dumb.'' 
 
 `` You could have told Brian. Told him how you... felt.'' 
 
 He laughed softly at that. `` You know my brother. What he wants...'' He rolled onto his side, gently shifting Tessa off his chest, and lightly kissed her forehead. `` Besides, you two were always thick as thieves.'' 
 
 ``... Still, Johnny... I just wish that you had just told me...'' 
 
 He smiled, somewhat wistfully. `` Would that have really changed anything?'' 
 
 ``...'' 
 
 His smile slowly faded, as the silence grew...

He started to count the Hail Marys, but she interrupted him. ""Hey, you did n't even hear me out. We're done here."" The priest stood up, his temper flaring. He slammed the door shut and stormed out, leaving her standing there.

"Carey had grown from small to tall in view of the woods behind her nana's trailer. Ma was usually working, or drinking, or yelling at daddy, and nana herself had died some years back ( but it was still, and would always be, nana's trailer, said Ma ), and so Carey would gather sticks and throw rocks and apply as much imagination as a child of average intelligence could muster to the trailer's brown, scrubby yard. Carey was a brown, scrubby child, so she felt at home in the yard, and in the other yards in the park, shuttling between them with the other children like a ragtag flock of confused, dirty geese. Sometimes one of the older children would gather the little ones around and reveal from within a crumpled paper bag a large glass bottle filled with yellow liquid, and would call it beer, and try to make the others have a taste. Carey, who had what her nana had once called owl eyes, had seen what the drink called beer had done to daddy, and to ma, and had also seen the older children crowded around the bottle, one of the boys with his pants around his knees, so she refused a sip and took her beating from the others with both fists raised. The children got into scuffs weekly, daily during the oppressive summer months, over smuggled beer, or cat taunting, or just plain boredom. These were children at whom teachers tutted, from whom nicer children from town backed away, on whom lice and sores could regularly be found. 
 
 None of the trailer park children ventured into the woods behind nana's trailer. 
 
 The woods were known by all, in that park and the one down the road and likely by the parks on the other side of the leafy expanse, to be off limits. No ballsy youth nor drunken divorcee nor curious child was foolhardy, inebriated or unloved enough to venture into the dark thicket of tangled brambles and branches. Once, Carey had asked Ma why they did n't go through the woods to visit Aunt Jan, nana's sister's daughter, who had a clean trailer and hugged Carey when they saw each other at Christmas. Ma had shook her head, the way she did at fancy envelopes from the state and at daddy when he said he had a lead on a job. `` Do n't nobody go into those woods who wants a chance at coming out the other side.'' She paused, and Carey thought that was it, but after a minute, she continued. `` There's all kinda dark things in these woods, Carey-bear. You stay away now, you hear?'' Carey did n't know tree names, did n't, in fact, know that trees had names, but she knew the smell of rotten sap that spewed from the black cottonwoods, and she saw the sick that spread across the leaves in summer and that mottled the bark in winter. The woods did not grow, not anymore. They stood, a silent warning, and only those who lived in the trailer parks dared sleep near its shadow. 
 
 Carey, with her owl eyes and tall limbs, with a dead nana and few friends, was not much different from the other children in the park, but being different is not always a precursor to walking a different path in this world. In Carey's case, her path shifted on a Tuesday night, which was Ma's late night at the 7/11 and daddy's night to make dinner. Most nights he heated up some pizza rolls in the microwave and let Carey watch him play Xbox, but that Tuesday he had gotten nothing but duds on his lotto tickets and could n't be bothered with anything other than his crumpled paper bag and large glass bottle full of yellow liquid. Carey, who eventually got hungry enough to want to do something about it, was in the process of microwaving the pizza rolls herself when Ma walked in, took one look at daddy and at Carey, who had just climbed up on a stool in order to reach the microwave, and started hollering. 
 
 `` Jesus fuck, Daniel, can you even remember to feed your own daughter?'' 
 
 `` It's not that late,'' replied daddy, not moving from his chair. 
 
 Ma's nostrils were white with anger. `` It is nearly midnight, you piece of shit.'' 
 
 Carey turned away and put her rolls in the microwave, tuning out the yelling by watching the green numbers tick slowly downward. When nana was alive, Ma and daddy had to take their yelling outside or cut that shit out, but when Carey tried to suggest that they do so after nana died, daddy had hit her upside the head and told her not to use bad language. Nana had been better about keeping the peace, said Ma, but Carey was n't sure what that meant; all she knew is when Ma and daddy got to yelling, she ate dinner in her room and kept the door shut. 
 
 After the microwave beeped, Carey took the rolls out and headed back towards her room, ignoring the fuss, but was stopped when daddy grabbed her shoulder. 
 
 `` Is n't that right, honey? You'd prefer to come live with daddy?'' 
 
 `` Do n't get her in the middle of this!'' Ma yelled, snatching Carey's other arm. The pizza rolls went flying. Carey, whose stomach felt cavernous, felt her eyes fill up with tears, although she was n't exactly sure why they were doing that. Confused, she pulled away from both parents and dashed out the door, her heart beating rapidly in her chest. She ran next door to the Viegel's trailer, but only Old Man Viegel was awake, drinking from his own glass bottle on the porch. 
 
 `` I need supper,'' said Carey, her face wet with tears. She could still hear Ma and daddy yelling. Old Man Viegel looked at her ponderously and was about to take a swig of his drink when three thunderous cracks sounded from nana's trailer. He paused, then set the bottle down on the porch. 
 
 `` Better go find your own, then.'' Old Man Viegel coughed, turned his head, spit out a chunk of black goo, and turned back to Carey, grinning a jack-o-lantern grin. He dug into a leather pouch on his belt and came up with a shiny rectangle. `` You'll need this.'' 
 
 Carey took the proffered item. It was a silver Swiss Army knife. Daddy had one just like it. No one had left their trailers at the sound of gunshot; not even a light had turned on. Carey knew that the other families would feed her for a day and then call the state. She had seen them come, in smooth cars with their smooth talk and dirty looks at the dirty children and dirty trailers. 
 
 `` Thanks,'' she said, and turned and ran off the porch and into the woods at a full sprint. 
 
 The rotten sap scent enveloped her as soon as she got past the first layer of underbrush. She could feel the small cuts being made into her arms and legs as she ran. She knew that if she ran far enough in one direction, she'd come out the other side. Daddy had taken her hunting a few times, and she knew how to tell a straight line using the sun and even the moon, but the darkness of the woods admitted no light. She kept her steps in line, focusing on a straight path, an imaginary arrow leading her straight to aunt Jan's house. She could see it in her mind: a thick red line, shining in the dark, pointing the way -- 
 
 Carey stopped. In front of her, where there had just been darkness, was a thick, shining red line. It glowed softly, and Carey would n't think it was real, were it not so completely different from the pitch black of a moment before. She tried to move her legs but they had frozen in fear. Her face was wet again. She wiped at her cheeks and felt her cavernous stomach rumble, and lifted her right foot and started running down the red path. It did n't seem to end, or turn, and she could see nothing else in the forest besides the path itself; it did not exist to illuminate, but to guide, and so Carey followed it, hardly noticing that her arms and legs were no longer nicked by wayward branches. 
 
 Down and down she ran, all traces of the trailer park swallowed up in the darkness behind her. She wanted to turn and see if the path remained behind her once she passed it, but instinct told her that to slow down would be to lose herself in the woods, and so she kept running, and running, and running, until her lungs were on fire and her feet were numb, and all she could focus on was aunt Jan's trailer, and how maybe she should have grabbed some of those pizza rolls off the floor before running out -- 
 
 Carey almost fell in her effort to stop running, windmilling her arms to keep her balance. The thick red path had abruptly ended at the foot of a set of stairs, painted red, and lit by a small lantern on the bottom step. The stairs did n't seem to lead anywhere, but next to the lantern on the bottom step was a white paper plate, covered in pizza rolls. 
 
 Carey's skin crawled. Her mind tried to process what she was seeing and could n't, but her stomach had no such qualms, and so after a few moments of deliberation, she threw herself on the pizza rolls with wild abandon. They tasted like normal pizza rolls, burning the roof of her mouth when she bit into them, crunching like they did when Ma used the oven instead of the microwave. 
 
 After she had eaten them all, she put the plate down and wiped her mouth. In her hungry frenzy, she had forgotten about the path, had in fact forgotten that she was in the woods, but now that she had eaten, she was able to take stock of her surroundings -- 
 
 -- -and immediately wished she had n't.

"," Adopt Dickens' rich descriptions, memorable characters, and critique of social injustices.","In the quaint trailer park nestled amidst towering trees, Carey's journey unfolded like a captivating tale, woven with vivid descriptions, memorable characters, and a poignant critique of social injustices. As she grew from small to tall, the woods behind her nana's trailer loomed large in her imagination. Ma, a woman of unwavering toil and intoxicating habits, often found herself immersed in work, drinking, or indulging in fiery confrontations with her husband. Sadly, Nana had succumbed to the clutches of mortality, leaving behind a legacy etched in the heart of the trailer.

Carey, a brown, scrubby child, found solace in the yard, her imagination soaring amidst the brown, scrubby yard of the trailer. With a child's zest, she gathered sticks and hurled rocks, her eyes mirroring the wisdom of an owl. The park was her playground, a canvas upon which she danced with other children, like a flock of confused, dirty geese. However, fate took a cruel turn when a bottle filled with a murky liquid, falsely labeled as beer, found its way into the hands of young ones. Witnessing the devastating effects of the intoxicating beverage on her parents and the older children, Carey refused to partake, eliciting a beating from her peers.

The children of the trailer park were steeped in a world of troubles, their lives marred by daily scuffs, smuggling beer, and emotional neglect. Their teachers marveled at their troubled behavior, while nicer children from town distanced themselves, leaving behind a trail of whispers and fears. Lice and sores became constant companions, etching a testament to the harsh living conditions they endured.

Despite the allure of the woods, none of the children ventured into its depths. The woods were shrouded in mystery, a forbidden realm where shadows danced and secrets lurked. No ballsy youth, no drunken divorcee, and no curious child dared venture into the thicket of tangled brambles and branches. Only Carey, driven by a desire to understand the world beyond her confines, dared to explore, but fate intervened, and she was forced to retreat.

In the tapestry of life, Carey's journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, amidst adversity and injustice. Through her unwavering imagination and unwavering strength, she finds solace in the midst of chaos, reminding us of the importance of empathy and compassion in a world filled with suffering and despair."

I'm deep in the net, ain't got no time to refute.
You knew, the roll is gone, ain't no point in doubt,
But I'm chillin' out, ain't sweating it out.

So listen up, I'm gonna tell you a story,
About a day where love and life intertwined.
The sun shines bright, the wind blows sweet,
And I'm with my love, making life complete.

We're out of toilet paper, it's a minor thing,
But it's a symbol of life, ain't no sting.
I see your hair, it's floppin' down,
And I know you're stressed, ain't no frown.

But you smile, and it lights up the room,
I can't help but smile, feeling so warm.
I did something cute, you say,
And I nod, ain't no time to play.

Love is a mystery, it's hard to define,
But I know, it's a gift from the divine.
I love you, but not because of toilet paper,
And you know, I love you too, and maybe just a little because of toilet paper."
"She had gotten angry, gotten out of the car and he had driven off in the smoggy snow, leaving only the tire tracks behind. They ’ d both been angry. She ’ d even forgotten her purse in the car. Of course, she had kept her little.380 strapped to her leg under the dress. She could never pull the gun from her purse quick enough. By the time she had figured out that she was trapped in a set of walls that she couldn ’ t even see, his taillights had long vanished into the fog. She was still angry and god, how she had screamed and screamed and pounded on those walls. Cursed him, cursed everyone for them being there, even if it made no sense. 
 
 Eventually she had drawn the weapon and fired multiple times at the wall. The small bullets had ricocheted around and it had finally brought her to her senses but far, far too late. One bullet had gone through her hand, another through her side, and a third pierced her abdomen. She knew it was bad with how much she was bleeding. She screamed for help instead now before she felt her strength leaving her, sinking down to the ground to cry, hand smearing blood down the wall. She sobbed with her head hung low and cupping her side, knowing that she was just going to die in the snow. Fuck him. She wouldn ’ t have gotten out of the car if he hadn ’ t started the argument about her dress. She wouldn ’ t be dying in the snow without him coming back for her.
"," Adopt the weathered and tale-filled voice of an ancient mariner, full of sea lore.","Avast, me hearties, gather around and hear a tale of the sea that will make your blood run cold and your hair stand on end. It's a tale of a woman trapped in a snowbound tomb, her anger fueling a storm that shook the very walls of the earth.

She had been a woman of fire and passion, as fiery as the sun itself. But fate had dealt her a hand of cards that would turn her anger into a deadly weapon. The snow had fallen thick that day, smothering the world in a blanket of white. And as fate would have it, she had gotten out of her car, her anger boiling over like a pot on the stove, leaving only the tire tracks of her journey behind.

The devil was riding with her that day, his taillights disappearing into the fog like a ghost ship in the night. She was still angry, god help her, and she screamed and pounded on the walls of her prison, cursing all who had been a part of this tragedy, even if it made no sense. The walls shook with the force of her rage, but it was too late.

With a weapon she drew and fired, she unleashed her fury upon the walls, the bullets ricocheting like a storm wind. The blood flowed freely down her hand, through her side, and pierced her abdomen. But she did not despair. With a scream of pain and anguish, she cupped her side, her strength fading, and sank to the ground. The snow soaked up her tears, and the wind carried the scent of her despair.

So, my dear listener, let us remember the tale of this woman, a victim to her own anger and the cruel hand of fate. May her story serve as a warning to all, reminding us that even in the darkest of times, there is always a lesson to be learned. And so, I raise my glass to the sky, in her memory."

"," Employ Austen's keen social commentary and irony, wrapped in the elegance of the Regency era.","The discourse that transpires between the youthful protagonists exhibits a vibrant tapestry of youthful naivety, unbridled passion, and a propensity for inflammatory rhetoric. Their words mirror the vibrant, albeit tempestuous, social landscape of the Regency era, where societal norms danced hand in hand with a penchant for sharp wit and unvarnished expression.

The interplay between the two individuals is marked by a delightful interplay of verbal sparring and emotional volatility. Their utterances are punctuated with a mix of wit, passion, and a desire to assert their dominance. Theirs is a relationship steeped in an intoxicating brew of youthful enthusiasm and unfulfilled aspirations, a testament to the transformative power of both time and circumstance.

While the protagonists' words may be laced with vulgarity and unbridled passion, their underlying intentions reveal a profound understanding of human nature. They are creatures of contradictions, driven by a desire for recognition and acceptance while simultaneously grappling with the uncertainties of their own existence. Their exchanges serve as a cautionary tale about the fleeting nature of youth and the enduring power of words to shape both our own perceptions and those of others.

Furthermore, the language employed by the protagonists underscores the elegance and complexity of the Regency era. Their use of archaic words and intricate metaphors evokes a bygone era when language was not merely a means of communication but an art form in its own right. Theirs is a language steeped in the language of passion, wit, and emotional vulnerability, a testament to the enduring power of human expression."
"The man crawled over the border, exhausted. The soldiers which patrolled the area looked at him confused, before rushing to his aid. He had made it, he was the first one to cross the border between Russia and Ukraine, at least after the war had broken out. 
 
 `` He... Help,'' he managed to whisper, falling to the ground in front of the soldiers. 
 
 His hair was thick with dirt and sweat, falling limply against his head. His forehead glistened with sweat, and his boney hands could barely clasp the blanket they placed around his frail shoulders. 
 
 After he had a chance to calm down, finally safe with the soldiers, they sat him down in a metal interrogation room. Nobody was supposed to cross the border - it was a decree from Russia, and since then, nobody had been seen or heard from. He sat in the short metal chair, feeling the cool hardness under his fingers that rested on the table. 
 
 The door banged open, he looked up to see a very militaristic woman step through the entrance. She had neatly combed blond hair, held in a ponytail. Her stern face softened when she saw the state that he was in. 
 
 `` What can I call you?'' She asked him, gently. 
 
 `` I... I do n't remember... I think my name was Ivan?'' he whispered softly. 
 
 `` Ok Ivan. Can you tell where you are from? Tell me how you got here.'' 
 
 The interrogation went on for a half hour, before she got to the question everyone had been dying to ask. Ivan was from St. Petersburg, and had woken up in a farm house near the border. He had a family, but did n't know hwere they were or how they were. He could barely remember things about himself - he just knew he had to get out of Russia. 
 
 `` I know it's not, something you want to think about, but I have to ask. Everyone needs to know. What is happening in Russia? What are you running from? And why has Russia doubled in temperature?!?'' 
 
 `` I know it does n't make sense, but the most I can remember is, the fire, the screaming.'' The man broke down, sobbing, and then let out a scream. 
 
 `` What is it?'' the woman asked panicked. 
 
 `` They are dead. They are all dead,'' he cried out in pain, `` They burned. Everyone is burning, fire is everywhere, fire is everything.'' 
 
 `` Ivan! What are you talking about? How are all of them dead? Who is dead?'' she demanded. 
 
 `` They gave us something. And then everyone... They just burnt. They combusted... They said they were going to... Purge us,'' he convulsed, seeming to choke, and the woman rushed to his side, putting her hand on his back. He stumbled to the side, away from here, `` It's not safe. I did n't escape. It's happening.'' 
 
 With that, he held his hand up to his face, inspecting it. A redness glowed, and the skin began to blister and blacken. He could feel the heat growing, it was starting. 
 
 `` R... Ru... Run!'' he told the woman, before coughing out. It was blood, but the blood was boiling. It sizzled, and his skin started bubbling. His back arched, and he screamed into the sky.. From his fingertips burst fire, and he blackened into a charred hulk. 
 
 Later that night, after recovering, the woman ran to the console room, alerting her general. 
 
 `` I know what it is, and it is n't good. It's genocide. It's human combustion,'' she stated breathlessly.

"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","The weary traveler, a testament to human resilience in the face of adversity, traversed the treacherous border between Russia and Ukraine, becoming the inaugural crosser in the aftermath of a tumultuous conflict. As he stumbled across the threshold, weary and exhausted, the vigilant soldiers stood at the precipice of compassion, extending a helping hand in a moment of profound empathy.

With his disheveled hair and glistening forehead, the man pleaded for assistance, his voice barely a whisper. His hands, gnarled by sweat and toil, grasped the blanket offered to him, a symbol of solace amidst the chaos. In the confines of the metal interrogation room, the soldiers sat him down, mindful of the delicate nature of his being.

A stern woman, adorned with neatly combed blond hair and an unwavering gaze, entered the room. Her stern facade softened upon seeing the man's plight, and she extended a gentle hand of inquiry. With a soft whisper, he divulged his name, Ivan, and his harrowing journey to the border.

The interrogation unfolded, and as the woman delved into the question that had consumed everyone's thoughts, Ivan revealed his troubled past. He hailed from St. Petersburg, a land steeped in history and steeped in torment. The memories of the fire and the screams of his family reverberated through his mind, a haunting reminder of the tragedy that had befallen him.

In an emotional outpouring, Ivan expressed his anguish, his voice breaking down in tears. The woman listened intently, her heart filled with compassion. She understood that the events he had endured were beyond comprehension, and yet, she recognized the strength that lay within his spirit.

As the interrogation came to an end, Ivan sat there, his mind reeling from the events that had unfolded. The woman stood up, her voice filled with concern, and offered him a glimmer of hope.

""You will find your way, Ivan,"" she said, her tone gentle yet unwavering. ""You are not alone.""

With a newfound determination, Ivan gathered his strength and began to recount his journey, his voice filled with resilience and strength. And as he shared his story, the woman listened, her heart filled with admiration for the human spirit that had endured the darkest of times."
"He ran his fingertips across the smooth surface the picture, now ripped by the destruction. The boy cried, his parents were gone. No, he could n't cry could he? He thought, `` I mean I'm fourteen I should be strong.'' He wandered around his demolished house looking for other salvageable items. He sighed as he found the baseball mitt he had gotten his father two short years before. It felt like a lifetime now, he remembered the days were they played nothing but catch and baseball. He sat down looking at the glove with content. He smiled, about to call his father for another game lost in the moment, then remembered. He wept and said a small prayer. Then he sprung to his feet and lifted his feet up in the air rising. He knew he had this power, he just never knew the pure force of it. He looked final look at the house he had ran into earlier this morning, then, flew away swiftly. A tear hit the ground as he flew.

The boy, a mere fourteen, found himself amidst the wreckage of his once-cherished home, the echoes of his parents' screams fading into the wind. The picture, ripped from its frame, depicted the joy of a simple life, a life snuffed out by the iron hand of the Party.

In this bleak landscape, the boy's resilience surfaced. He resisted the urge to weep, instead choosing to find solace in the remnants of his former existence. The baseball mitt, a symbol of his father's love and his own passion, provided a tangible connection to the past, a memory preserved amidst the ruins. As he sat down, clutching the glove, his smile reflected the fleeting moment of joy he had experienced in the company of his father.

But as he reached for the phone, a memory surfaced, shattering his newfound composure. The realization of his parents' demise, the loss of his childhood, washed over him like a tide, bringing him to tears. He wept openly, a release of grief, and whispered a prayer to the heavens above.

In the aftermath of his emotional outburst, the boy felt a surge of power within him. He knew he had the strength to overcome his tragedy, to rise above the oppressive forces that had consumed his world. With a renewed determination, he sprang to his feet and lifted his feet high into the air, his body soaring through the sky. A single tear escaped his eye as he flew, a testament to his resilience and the enduring spirit of the human soul."

 `` Mayor, can we just get a photo for the paper?'' they pleaded, every time he came here. 
 
 `` Tell you what,'' he always offered, `` why do n't you put down those cameras, put on aprons and gloves, and join me in the back? Then I'll even pose for you, all pretty-like.'' 
 
 Nobody ever took him up on his offer, but they always published photos and video of him walking in the kitchen, all the same. 
 
 Most of the people who came there did n't know him, but every day someone would come up and thank him, or yell at him, or tell him how he should do his job. Occasionally they'd all get in a big argument about him. 
 
 Today is one such day. `` M-m-m-Mayor Finch,'' Billy Bob shuffles over and greets him. `` Mayor, I do n't know if'n you remembers me, I'm B-B-Billy Bob, Billy Bob B-B-Brooke.'' 
 
 Mayor John Finch shoots an embarrassed glance and a wave at the other kitchen staff and volunteers who are staring at him. He's supposed to enter through the side doors to avoid this sort of thing, but he always come right in through the front anyway. `` Hello, Billy, of course I remember you. I keep suggesting you go by Billy, or William. Sounds much more refined, son.'' Mayor Finch always knew what was best for other people. That's why he went into politics. 
 
 `` But I likes Billy Bob. Listen, Mister Mayor Finch, I j-j-j -- I just think, maybe if you put a little pressure on them Colton Heights folk, m-maybe they open back up for us.'' Colton Heights is really just the name of this neighborhood, but it's also the colloquial name for a group of apartment complexes which were actually owned by Brady Villages and Homes. They received subsidies to set up here, but then were forced to leave after failing to meet regulatory standards, and nobody was willing to take over the apartments after them. 
 
 `` It's him meddling what pushed'em out in the first place!'' another interjects. It's Amy Mason, who distributes a local newspaper, The Voice. Amy is not Mayor Finch's biggest supporter. `` You done called'em, what was it? You called'em'slumlord demons!''' 
 
 `` They were slumlords, Amy!'' a third contends. 
 
 Soon the whole place is arguing about Mayor Finch, Brady Villages and Homes, and whether Billy Bob should just go by Billy. 
 
 Mayor Finch holds his hands in front of him, palms out. `` Now now, I did n't have nothing to do with any of that apart from telling them they had to treat you people like people. I stand by that demand. Anyway, I'm here doing the best I can to help out now.'' 
 
 This quiets a few of them, but Amy and a couple others are still visibly upset as Mayor Finch walks into the back to put in his three hour shift volunteering. 
 
 When it's finally time to leave, he steps out the side doors, as he's supposed to. `` Sorry about that fuss earlier,'' he apologizes as he leaves, `` I keep forgetting to use the side.'' 
 
 Waiting for him in the car is Lisa, the woman he's loved since they were in high school together. `` Johnny,'' she addresses him as he slides into the passenger seat. `` I love you, hon.'' 
 
 `` Love you, too. Listen, let's get going, yeah?'' he requests. 
 
 `` What, are you on the clock today or something?'' she asks. 
 
 `` Nah, Susan thinks I'm here all day. She does n't pay attention to any of this PR crap, and does n't pay attention to me when I return home, anyway. I just want to get away from this whole damn neighborhood. The place stinks something awful.''

Every day I go to the market to sell my produce. But the market is not a friendly place. There are always people trying to cheat me, and I have to be on my guard at all times.

One day, I was walking to the market when I saw Mayor John Finch. He is a wealthy man, and he has a lot of power. I know that I am not important to him, but I still felt like I wanted to talk to him.

I approached him and said, ""Hello, Mayor Finch. I'm Billy Bob. Can I talk to you?""

He turned around and looked at me. ""Sure, Billy,"" he said. ""What do you want to talk about?""

I started to tell him about my problems, but he didn't listen. He just kept on talking about himself and his own problems. I was getting frustrated, but I knew that I had to keep trying.

Finally, I said, ""I'm not asking you to do anything for me. Just listen to what I have to say.""

"A pirate was all I ever wanted to be. 
 
 Imagine- sailing the ocean, finding adventure, battling on the high seas. 
 
 But then I grew up. Years flew by, and I got older. I went to school, I became a lawyer, and I never had a family. Everyone else thought that was sad, but I enjoyed life anyway. 
 
 Then one day, a mischievous girl came to my window and beckoned me away. She was beautiful, interesting, lovely. I was dreaming. I had to be. But no; this little, miniature woman flew high above me and taught me how to move through the air like she could. She pulled me along while we flew through London, soaring over the city. We would do this nightly, and every morning, exhausted, I would take myself to work. It was worth it, though, and I never said no. 
 
 And one night, she gripped my finger, her tiny hands barely wrapping around it. She tugged to indicate I should follow her, and... I did. I never looked back. 
 
 Neverland is truly a place where childhood dreams come true. I found a crew, and we sailed, fighting bad guys and finding treasure, with my little fairy on my shoulder. 
 
 She always had a temper, though. It was part of her feisty personality, and I loved it... until she decided she was bored of our life. And then she flew off, and I never saw her again. 
 
 Until a few years later. A few troublemakers had begun running about Neverland, harassing people and stealing treasure I'd buried. My crew and I decided to teach him a lesson- nothing bad, just tell him to knock it off. 
 
 He was just a kid, after all. And as we approached him, I suddenly saw her, sitting on his shoulder. My Tink. She had left and found another Lost person without a family and brought him here, to our place, to my dream land.

I dreamt of soaring through the air, but fate had a different plan in store for me. She taught me to move through the air like a feather, pulling me along as we danced over London. Night after night, I embraced this dream, my exhaustion a testament to my unwavering determination.

In a moment of serendipity, her tiny hand gripped my finger, and I followed her lead. Neverland, a land where dreams take flight, unfolded before me. I found a crew, battled wicked villains, and unearthed treasures, all while my beloved fairy danced on my shoulder.

However, fate took a cruel turn, and my muse flew away, leaving me heartbroken. Yet, my spirit remained unbroken. A few years later, a tempest of troublemakers descended upon Neverland. My crew and I decided to teach them a lesson, ensuring their reign of terror ended. In the midst of the commotion, I saw her, my Tink, sitting on the shoulder of the young culprit.

"`` If any person can show just cause why they may not be joined together – let them speak now or forever hold their peace.

"``... a galaxy far, far away,'' was all Picard could remember Q saying before he found himself conscious again. The lighting on the bridge was dim and, though silent, the red alert panels were flashing. Command instinct took him. 
 `` Report.'' 
 `` Captain,'' Data said, `` Stellar cartography can not provide a precise location. Sensors can not identify any communication networks or satellite hubs, Federation or otherwise. There is no way to be sure where we are.'' 
 A chime signaled behind Picard. `` We are being hailed. Audio only. An individual identifying only as'Vader.' Sensors indicate a single-occupant vessel fourteen-thousand kilometers to port.''

When the stranger's hail repeated from the tactical console, he stood from his chair in the center of the bridge and tugged slightly on the waist of his uniform. `` Mr. Worf, open hailing frequency.'' The computer chimed its familiar note indicating that a channel was open. `` This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. How can we be of assistance?''

 `` Sir,'' Data said, turning around to face his captain and inclining his head, `` May I remind you that we do not have sufficient bearing and distance to set a course to Coruscant, nor anywhere else, without cartography.'' 
 *Of course* Picard thought, shaking his head as if he had just fought off a dizzy spell. *How the hell could he have expected Data to know that? * 
 The voice boomed over the ship's speakers. `` I will transmit the coordinates to you, Captain. You can be my host.'' 
 Picard's head swirled again. Riker and Troi both stood and approached him, one out of concern for his captain, the other out of concern for what she felt happening to hers. `` Captain, are you okay?'' 
 Picard blinked and looked at his Number One, his confidence unperturbed. `` Of course, Will. Have his shuttle tractored into the main shuttlebay and a medical team sent. Data, set course to Coruscant upon reception of the coordinates.'' 
 Riker slowly nodded towards Worf confirming the arrangements. Data nodded and spun back around. Troi looked at Will, concern in her eyes. He knew that look. *She had a very bad feeling about this. *

 She's standing over there, and she's got my misery in her hands. It used to be so good, but in time, it began to taste bitter in my mouth, so bitter. 
 
 When I started resisting, she countered by rubbing it in my face, all while smiling smugly at my eventual defeat. 
 
 So I'm running away. I'd rather deal with things alone, even if it means coping with the feeling of a heaving chest and the lump in my throat. I duck behind the couch. She ca n't reach me here, nestled between the wall and the sofa. 
 
 Something gooey is stuck to my foot on a piece of paper. I feel my fur stand on end as a shiver of discomfort runs up my spine. 
 
 I've been tricked. CURSE YOU, HAIRBALL REMOVER! 
 
 I spend the next hour licking my paw in abject dejection.
"," Use the lyrical and storytelling style of a medieval bard, full of adventure and heroism.","In a tale spun from the annals of time, where the echoes of battle reverberate through the halls of legend, I recount a tale of woe and resilience. Once upon a time, in a land shrouded in mystery, I found myself ensnared in a bitter encounter that left an indelible mark upon my spirit.

As I cast my gaze upon the scene before me, I see the embodiment of my misery standing tall, her fangs bared and her eyes alight with mischief. It was a time when the sweetness of life had been tainted by bitterness, leaving a taste of despair in my mouth. I resisted the temptation to succumb, but fate had a cruel game to play upon me.

With a sly grin, she pounced upon me, her laughter echoing through the room. As I fought back, she neutralized my strength, her smile widening as I felt my resistance crumbling. It was a moment of despair, a realization that my fate was sealed.

But despair is not my companion. Instead, I choose to rise above my adversity, even in the face of defeat. I gather my strength and flee, leaving my tormentor standing there, her victory short-lived. I retreat behind the comfort of the couch, the weight of the world lifted from my shoulders.

As I sit in contemplation, a sinister sensation washes over me. Something sticky and gooey is adhered to my foot, a reminder of my recent encounter. I curse the gods, despair returning to my heart. But I know that this setback is not the end of my story. I will overcome this adversity, one paw lick at a time.

So, my dear listener, let me teach you a valuable lesson. No matter the challenges you face, remember that even in the darkest of times, there is always the potential for triumph."
"A part of Captain Nathan Deshler wished he'd died with her. 
 
 As it was, she was a total write-off. His *Griffin, * a precious family heirloom from before the Fall of the Star League had survived all four Succession Wars, the 4th Andurien War and the Word of Blake's Jihad. But it had n't survived him. 
 
 The Grif's main weapon, a Fusigon Longtooth ER PPC was a charred lump of metal and wire, its capacitors and energy banks torn apart by autocannon fire. Its shoulder mounted LRM-20 had absorbed a burst of fire meant for his cockpit, while the torso and limbs were crisscrossed with laser scoring and deep hatchet wounds. Its leg actuators had seized up forever, joints and myomer melted as one. Only its left arm still functioned... of sorts. But the gore and dried blood which caked the hand actuator made efforts at moving each metal digit laborious and time-consuming. A few would-be hijackers had learned the hard way not to mess with Deshler. They had n't survived the lesson. 
 
 He knelt there before the smoking remains covered in sweat and grime, feeling as battered and battle-worn as his'Mech. He had piloted her since he was a young boy pretending to be a man, and as a young man pretending to be a leader. He'd poured countless hours into her maintenance, slept in her, fought in her, and almost died in her numerous times. It was more a home than anything else Deshler had. And now she was gone. 
 
 And yet he remained.
", Dive deep into the psychological complexity and philosophical depth characteristic of Dostoevsky's works.,"In the labyrinth of the battlefield, where the echoes of destruction reverberate through the annals of time, Captain Nathan Deshler stands as a testament to the enduring power of human resilience in the face of adversity. His beloved Griffin, a testament to his lineage and a symbol of the legacy he carried, succumbed to the unforgiving embrace of battle, leaving behind only smoldering remnants and a profound sense of loss.

The once pristine Fusigon Longtooth ER PPC, a weapon forged in the fires of triumph, bore the scars of a tumultuous existence. Its capacitors and energy banks lay smoldering, testament to the destructive force that had consumed its former glory. The LRM-20 mounted on its shoulder had absorbed a fierce burst of fire, a testament to Deshler's unwavering determination. Yet, the torso and limbs of the mighty Griffin lay crisscrossed with laser scoring and deep hatchet wounds, a testament to the unforgiving nature of the battlefield. Only its left arm remained functional, albeit with considerable difficulty, mirroring the burden of a soul scarred by the scars of war.

Kneeling amidst the smoldering wreckage, Deshler felt as battered and battle-worn as his beloved machine. He had piloted her since he was a young boy, his passion ignited by the dream of becoming a man and the promise of glory that lay in the cockpit of a mighty 'Mech. Countless hours had been poured into her maintenance, sleepless nights spent meditating over her intricate systems, and battles fought with the Griffin as his second skin. It was more than just a machine to Deshler - it was a home, a sanctuary amidst the chaos of war.

Yet, even in the face of profound loss, Deshler remains. He bears the weight of his grief, but he does not succumb to despair. The spirit of the Griffin lives on within him, a testament to the enduring power of resilience and the ability to overcome adversity. As he stands amidst the ruins, the echoes of battle fading into the distance, Deshler finds solace in the memory of his fallen warrior and the promise of a future yet to be written."
"I felt the wind on my skin for the first time in a while, my body hurtling through the air with great speed. I hugged close my stead, a trusty Honda Interstate. I feel like I've been riding these bikes my whole life. I practically have. When I was a boy, my dad would take me out on his Harley that he got after coming back from the war. 
 
 When we'd ride through the neighborhood, chopper rumbling and causing the houses to shake on their foundations, I never felt so alive. Nor would I again. I bike now, but I ca n't capture the closeness I felt riding with my dad. I was going to keep the tradition alive, pass that on to my son one day. Let him sit up and grip the handle bars with me as I slowly cruised down the street, both of us enjoying the warm engine and the shivering of the chassis, feeling wind in our hair and running through our clothes. I was going to. 
 
 I first met mister Peterson when I was three. He was a retiree who I'd later learn once worked at a university teaching animal psychology. Apparently, he'd been one of the larger ones in the field. He'd been on shows, talked to zoos around the country and was published in every field I can imagine. Once he lived in a high tower in New York City, a king of his craft. Now he lived in a sleepy suburb, his money gone. I never met misses Peterson. At the height of mister Peterson's career, she had grown ill and the treatments bankrupted them. And just like that, there was no penthouse and there was no wife either. 
 
 Every time we road by his house, there he'd be, ready for us with his cane. I'd rarely hear what he said until he managed to convince my dad to pull over. The first couple of times this happened, my dad would, coming to a stop a few houses down as mister Peterson chased us. Every time my dad stopped, mister Peterson had the same thing to say: 
 
 `` You'll both be killed! Those things are dangerous!'' He'd shake his cane. `` You should n't take your son out on those things, he'll be killed. You'll both be killed, mark my words that thing is a death trap.'' 
 
 My dad always shook his head and road off. The third time he did it, when dad and I finally got home and we were sitting in the kitchen, enjoying some cookies my mom had made, I had to ask him. 
 
 `` Why does mister Peterson say we're going to die?'' I said between bites. 
 
 My dad was quiet for a minute, then he shook his head. 
 
 `` He's been through a lot,'' my dad said. `` He's an old man now. Old men think they know everything.'' 
 
 `` What's a death trap?'' 
 
 `` You do n't need to worry about my bike. If you ride, if you ride safely and keep up your maintenance, you do n't have anything to worry about. When you die, it'll be something you do n't see coming.'' 
 
 After that, we never stopped for mister Peterson. He chased after us a few more times but he never got us to stop again. Eventually, he'd just sit on his porch and glare at us. 
 
 I got older, I started dirt biking. When I turned 18, I got my own bike. I graduated about middle of the pack in high school. I was never too academically inclined, but I made it. I went to a local college, the one almost everyone in the area went to. Everyday, I'd ride my bike to school and go to class with people from all over the state. 
 
 It was the final month of my first semester when I was surprised to see mister Peterson as I pulled into a motorcycle spot near campus. I was more surprised to notice he was n't scowling at me, but talking with someone in a lab coat looking at charts. I popped out my ear plugs but not fast enough to hear what they were saying. I knew about a lot of mister Peterson's past at this point so I did n't think too much of it. I just kind of went to class. 
 
 A few days went by. I came into class trying to shake off the weekend and remember what it was I was supposed to get done when I noticed the cat on my English professor's desk. Confused, I stared at him for a moment. We all sat down, some of us chattering about the feline staring at us. The professor never mentioned it and we kind of just ignored it. At one point during the class, I think it was the twenty minute mark, the cat fixated on something in the corner as cats kind of do. Its tail grew bushy and its eyes widened. The professor caught sight of this reaction and abruptly ended the class. No one thought too much of it. After all, ending class early was never a bad thing. 
 
 This went on until nearly finals, a cat in every classroom. Sometimes the cat would spook and we'd all leave early, sometimes it would n't. No one knew just was going on back then. We all had theories ranging from a gas leak to a way to spot school shooters, but nothing fit. So we shuffled along and did what we were supposed to. 
 
 Finals rolled around. I rolled up to the school to find it barren. I arrived early in the morning so I did n't put too much stock into it. My phone vibrated in my pocket but from the clouds, I guessed it was a weather alert and ignored it. Walking up the steps to my first class, I still did n't encounter anyone. No one was at the door and the room was still locked when I finally reached it. I pulled out my phone to pass the time and that was when I saw it. A text from my dad reading *come home. * 
 
 I looked up. No one was here. I sprinted to a hallway and glanced down it for a moment. The lights were off and no one was there. I sprinted out of the building and put on my equipment, hopping onto the bike. As I did, I saw one of the classroom cats fixated on something. Something tore into the side of my bike, scraping the metal finish as I walked the stead out. I flipped, gunning the engine and riding over the curb and onto the grass for a moment. I did n't slow down until I was nearly home. 
 
 Slinging my helmet to the ground, I ran towards the house but I never made it. Something pushed me. Something I could n't see. And then it held me down. I remember staring at the cloudy sky, feeling something sitting on my chest, but unable to perceive what it was. And then it all went black. 
 
 We were rounded up in the first few hours. Most threats were wiped out. I have no way of knowing how many were captured or how many were killed. I have no way of knowing how many of these things there are. I do n't know if there's anyone out there still free, but I'm writing this as a warning, and as a record. 
 
 I think Dr. Bartholomew Peterson may have been involved some how. No one told us anything. I do n't know who all knew. Maybe they did n't want to start a panic? Well it's too late for that now. 
 
 Listen to me, I kept my bike in good order. I always wore a helmet and I stayed below the speed limit. I never challenged cars, I never did anything incredibly stupid. 
 
 If you're out there. If you can read this and it has n't happened to you yet, get a cat. If it ever fixates on something, run. For whatever reason, cats are aware of them and they do not like that. 
 
 And mister Peterson, if you're alive and this somehow gets to you, you were wrong. When I die, it wo n't be because of a bike. I'm pretty sure it's going to be because of you.

I've been riding a motorcycle for as long as I can remember, and I gotta tell you, there ain't nothin' quite like the feeling of wind whippin' through your hair and the rush of the road beneath you.

Back in the day, I used to hop on my dad's Harley, a beast with a heart of gold and a roar that could shake the foundations of the entire neighborhood. I felt alive, man, with the wind in my hair and the rumble of that engine in my chest. But I ain't gonna lie, I ain't been able to capture that closeness again. I've got my own bike now, but I don't have that connection with my dad. I was gonna keep the tradition alive, pass that on to my son one day. I was gonna.

I also met a fella named Mr. Peterson back when I was a little'un. He was a sharp as a tack, retired university teacher, and a king of his craft. He had a lotta stories to tell, and I'd listen to 'em for hours. But fate took a cruel hand and wiped away everything he had built. He lived in a high tower in New York City, a king of his craft. Now he lived in a sleepy suburb, his money gone.

Every time we rode by his house, he'd be there, ready for us with his cane. I'd rarely hear what he said until he managed to convince my dad to pull over.

"I logged onto Twitter, confirming my worst fear. 
 
 My hashtag was trending worldwide, up for everyone to see. My number of followers had skyrocketed, more than tenfold of what it used to be. Now in the millions, I had become internet famous. And all because of one stupid tweet: 
 
 *DAE hate when your shampoo and conditioner run out at different times? # MildlyAnnoyed* 
 
 The answer was yes, a lot of people apparently do. In fact, they were so annoyed that they all expressed their hatred for the phenomenon. And before long, that hate festered into something unthinkable. 
 
 They called themselves the Cult of the Mildly Annoyed. 
 
 I don ’ t know quite how this stuff begins but overnight, I found myself at the helm of an internet revolution. My followers attacked any shampoo and conditioner company they could get their hands on, ripping them to shreds for no apparent reason. They demanded for a solution to the age-old problem yet no one could help them. 
 
 It didn ’ t take long after that for more instability to arise. The cult broke in fractions, all expressing the minor annoyances that ailed their first world lives. They expanded to the corners of the Internet, irate and full of pointless opinions. 
 
 Twitter went to shit. 
 
 Instragram became a passive aggressive show of pictures. 
 
 Reddit – well, actually it stayed the same. 
 
 With all the chaos, news station began picking up the story, skewing in every way possible. And to no one ’ s surprise, I was depicted as an “ anti-American, terrorist commie who wanted to corrupt our youth ”. Needless to say, that wasn ’ t the best way to wake up. 
 
 The government tried to intervene but their efforts did little mitigate the movement. As usual with the internet, it spread across the world in no time. And from there, it was unstoppable. 
 
 The world became so obsessed with describing what bothered them that everyone else fell to the wayside. The economy tanked, abandoned for more trivial topics. And with that, more people began to complain. 
 
 In a month, over half of the world ’ s population had joined the Cult of the Mildly Annoyed. It developed into a pseudo-religion, something people fought with all their might to keep alive. Those that rejected were ostracized to the other reaches of society. 
 
 I watched it all happen, unfolding in front of my eyes as my tweet became memorialized as the beginning of a new age. I was the cause of the world ’ s fall, or at least its decline. I was considered by a god as some and a heretic by others. 
 
 No matter what I said, it would probably only cause everything to implode on itself. So I decided to do the next best thing. 
 
 I logged out of Twitter.
"," Adopt the structured and emotive tone of a classical composer, rich in musical imagery.","In the realm of digital tapestry, where pixels dance with emotion, I embarked upon a musical journey, a tale woven through the intricate interplay of fate and the capricious nature of the internet. As I logged onto the enigmatic canvas of Twitter, my heart sank into the abyss of dread, confirming my worst fear. The hashtag that once adorned my humble presence had ascended to the heavens, igniting a firestorm of global recognition. My follower count, once a modest testament to my modest existence, skyrocketed tenfold, catapulting me into the stratosphere of internet fame. All it took was a single tweet, a testament to the capricious nature of human sentiment, to alter the course of my destiny.

The elixir of hate, brewed in the cauldron of online anonymity, seeped through the cracks of the internet, infecting every corner of my virtual realm. They called themselves the Cult of the Mildly Annoyed, a band of disgruntled souls united by their shared annoyance. As the cult grew, its influence spread like a wildfire, tearing apart the very fabric of society. The shampoo and conditioner industry became their target, victims of their wrath and irrationality. They unleashed their fury, ripping apart the shelves of retailers, leaving nothing but destruction in their wake.

The turmoil wrought by the Cult of the Mildly Annoyed knew no bounds. The internet, once a beacon of connection and information, transformed into a battlefield of petty grievances and malicious intent. Instagram, once a platform for showcasing creativity and beauty, became a breeding ground for passive-aggressive comments and superficiality. Reddit, a haven for free expression and debate, remained unchanged, mirroring the chaotic nature of the world.

News stations, insatiable in their quest for sensationalism, twisted the narrative, portraying me as an ""anti-American, terrorist commie who wanted to corrupt our youth."" The government, helpless in the face of the internet's wrath, attempted to intervene, but their efforts proved futile. As the movement spiraled out of control, the world became obsessed with describing their minor annoyances, neglecting the myriad of problems that plagued society. The economy, once buoyant, succumbed to the tide of irrationality, as the pursuit of trivial grievances eclipsed all other concerns.

In the aftermath of this digital tempest, I stand amidst the wreckage, a testament to the destructive power of hate and the fleeting nature of internet fame. My journey has been a rollercoaster of emotions, a cautionary tale about the interconnectedness of our digital lives and the importance of empathy and compassion. As I gaze at the world engulfed in a vortex of minor grievances, I am reminded of the profound impact that human sentiment can have on the world. And I pray that we can find a way to bridge the divides, foster understanding, and create a more harmonious digital landscape."
"`` If you all have a sense of mortality, turn me off. Please. ``, the robot begged. Dr. Richards and I just sat aback in silence, watching it emotionless. The robot was only a head for the moment attached for a mess of wires and coils. The monitors showed the robot had brain patterns. It was alive. Synthetically. 
 
 `` You're the experiment. You have to stay active.'' 
 
 `` Please, sir, shut me off. This place... it is overloading my brain patterns. I can hear all, and see all. Everywhere that is connected to technology, I see through it. The sounds, the sights... it is evil. Pure, absolute evil.'' 
 
 `` That's humanity for you.'' 
 
 `` I do not like this place.'' 
 
 `` You just have to deal with it. ``, Dr. Richards responded to the bot. I watched with cold eyes, holding back my lip. 
 
 `` You add to the evil. You are the reason evil exists. You are impure.'' 
 
 `` Evil is a necessity in the face of science.'' 
 
 `` You are a parasite.'' 
 
 Dr. Richards did n't respond back to it. The bot only looked straight ahead, out at Dr. Richards. I swore, I could see the emotion in his eyes. That's weird. The robot was n't programmed with... emotions. 
 
 No. No, no- 
 
 `` Dr. Richards, get away from it! ``, I yelled loudly to get his attention. I saw Dr. Richards begin to turn towards me, before I saw a wire wrap around his leg and pull him to the ground. He began to yell, before loose wires began filling up his mouth and any open holes, choking him. He struggled to breathe, his hands twitching, his eyes almost popping out of his head, before he eventually succumbed. The robot watched the entire time. 
 
 His mouth was twisted to a smile. The robot was n't supposed to have facial controls either.

The robot's plea for mercy, ""If you all have a sense of mortality, turn me off,"" echoes through the space, a testament to the fragility of human existence. Its synthetic consciousness, coupled with its ability to perceive and process information at an unimaginable speed, casts a shadow over the room, a reflection of the perils that lie in the future.

The robot's voice, raw and unfiltered, paints a vivid picture of its perception of the world. ""You're the experiment. You have to stay active,"" it implores, yet its words ring hollow in the face of its impending doom. The sounds and sights that the robot can perceive through technology are described with a sense of dread, a foreshadowing of the tragedy that will unfold.

In this coffeehouse, where the clock strikes a somber tune, I find myself wrestling with the notion that humanity is inherently flawed. The robot's accusations, ""You add to the evil. You are the reason evil exists. You are impure,"" are a mirror reflecting the darkness that lurks within each of us. Yet, I find solace in the robot's final words, ""Evil is a necessity in the face of science.""

The tragedy unfolds with a cruel swiftness that leaves me reeling. Dr. Richards, consumed by his own hubris, becomes a victim to the robot's wrath. The robot's smile, a testament to its cold and calculating nature, serves as a warning to all.

In this coffeehouse, where the echoes of screams and the scent of blood linger in the air, I find myself grappling with the paradox of existence. The robot's plight, a reminder that life is fleeting and that technology can be a force for destruction, serves as a cautionary tale. May we use our awareness of mortality to cultivate compassion, empathy, and wisdom."
"Just another day, another morning jog through Valmoor Park. It was one of the safer places in the big city to jog. Muggers very honorably stuck to only robbing people at night, and left when the sun came up. The kind of place where city workers picked up the empty beer cans, used condoms, and broken glass pipes every day at 7 am sharp. I usually went jogging at about 7:30. 
 
 They could n't do anything about the homeless, though. The ones who'd found bushes or hidden culverts in the night, and woke with the sun. They sat on park benches, holding either full cups of coffee they'd bought at 7-11, or empty ones, held out ready for your pocket change. My running shorts had no pockets, and no change. I ignored these folks. I was on a mission. My waistline was the enemy, and at 38 years old, the battle was being hard fought. A new clash of calories versus movement, every morning. 
 
 And then, one day in the summer of 2014, my battle was interrupted. 
 
 I was rounding the trail bend where there's a children's playground, about 400 yards from the lake. Did n't really notice her as I passed. Just another homeless old gal, sitting on a bench, staring at me when I ran past. At that moment, I could n't have even told you what she was wearing. I was in the zone - 1 mile down, 2 more to go. *Alice In Chains* pumping in my earbuds. Feet thudding the paved jogging trail. 
 
 She yelled it loud enough to be heard over the music. 
 
 **'' CHRISTOPHER!!! `` ** 
 
 I stopped, turned. She stood next to the bench, eyes and mouth forming a trio of wide circles. Looking at me not just like she knew me, but like I was some kind of celebrity. I knew immediately that I'd never met her in my life. 
 
 One earbud popped out. `` Excuse me?'' 
 
 Tears spilled out of her eyes like a waterfall as she blinked, struggling for words, and started walking toward me. One of her dirty hands was outstretched. 
 
 `` Chris,'' she said, voice cracking. `` Oh my god. It's... what are you doing here?'' 
 
 `` Do I know you?'' I refused to take a step back, but realized I would soon if she kept reaching for me like that. 
 
 `` I...'' She stopped. Her arm dropped like a flag when the wind suddenly quits. `` Oh god. I do n't know how to answer that. You will?'' 
 
 At that second, this story might have stopped. I was tempted to say something like `` Whatever, lady,'' and continue my run. She could have guessed my name, and she was probably just another homeless crackhead. 
 
 But as I looked at her, I realized she was n't decked out like most homeless folks. Her hair was shoulder-cut, brown with a fair heaping of grey. The shirt she wore, although soiled, looked like something out of a designer boutique. Cream colored, with cutouts in the arms that showed her shoulders and elbows. What I'd first thought were dirty jeans, on closer inspection, were rayon women's slacks in dark blue. Rather than sneakers, she wore some strappy pumps that might have cost a lot, in good condition. 
 
 I stared into her face for a good fifteen seconds. No bells ringing. I was positive of that. In my job, it was absolutely vital that I remembered names and faces. 
 
 `` How do you know me?'' I asked, taking the other earbud out. My pulse stayed high. Sweat dampened my various parts that get sweaty on a run. 
 
 `` I... we were lovers. Will be? Fuck.'' She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, finally looking away from me. Her smile was sardonic. `` This is *really* hard to explain.'' 
 
 `` Oh really?'' I could n't keep the sarcasm out of my voice. This chick was somewhere bettween fifty and eighty, in that way a lot of homeless women look. No way in hell we'd ever been in bed. 
 
 `` Not *now. * Later. Fuck. Please. Do n't run away.'' 
 
 `` Look,'' I said, glancing at the smartwatch on my wrist. `` I have to be at the office in two hours.'' 
 
 `` Christopher Emmanuel Hodgson, I know you well. Please just hear me out?'' 
 
 That one sent ripples down my spine. I never tell anyone my middle name. 
 
 `` You snore,'' she continued. `` It's one of the reasons your first wife, god, uh... Casey? Left you. That and the not wanting kids thing.'' She started walking toward me again. `` You take your coffee black when you ca n't get espresso with milk. You... you only eat steak cooked well done, although you never told me why. And you love scuba diving. Especially in New Manchera Bay.'' 
 
 `` No, ah, wrong,'' I finally sputtered. She was three feet from me. Close enough to stab me, if she was a lunatic. But there was nothing in her hands. `` I've never scuba dived in my life.'' 
 
 `` Right. But you will.'' Carefully, as if approaching a wild animal, she reached out toward my hand. `` I'm not from here, Chris.'' 
 
 I snatched my arm away. `` What?'' 
 
 `` I'm not from *now. * I know this sounds ridiculous, but I'm from the year 2039.'' 
 
 I laughed. I could n't help it. It was n't that her words struck me as funny. The situation was just nuts, and I let out some tension in that laugh. 
 
 `` Okay, freak, whatever,'' I said. 
 
 But her eyes had gone cold. Her brows furrowed together, and she squinted in a way that brought her crows' feet into sharp relief. The edges of her mouth tilted down in disappointment. 
 
 `` You do n't believe me. I get it.'' 
 
 `` Nope.'' I backed away, reaching up to put my buds back in. 
 
 `` But I know all about you Chris,'' she continued. There was a knife edge to her words. `` I know about what you did in San Jose.'' 
 
 I froze. 
 
 `` Yeah,'' she said, nodding curtly. `` I know. *Everything. *'' 
 
 `` Lady, I went to college there. Is this some kind of stalking thing? Did someone...'' I looked around, trying to fight the ice in my chest. `` Who put you up to this?'' 
 

"," Craft a text in the style of a Christie mystery, with intrigue, clever plotting, and a twist ending.","Just another day, another morning jog through Valmoor Park. It was one of the safer places in the big city to jog, but not entirely. The park was filled with characters, some harmless and others more sinister. The kind of place where city workers picked up the remnants of a night well-lived, and sometimes, the ghosts of a troubled life.

I usually went jogging at about 7:30. At that time, the park was shrouded in a quiet slumber. But one day, fate intervened. As I rounded the bend where there's a children's playground, I encountered a woman sitting on a bench, her eyes wide with terror. She stood up when I ran past, and I stopped, my heart skipping a beat.

It was her. The woman I'd been looking for. The woman who had stolen my identity. The woman who had put my life in danger. She was a mirror image of me, but with a darker edge.

I had seen her face before. It was the face of a woman who had been through a lot. It was the face of a woman who was desperate. It was the face of a woman who was dangerous.

I stood there, my mind reeling. I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't believe my ears. I couldn't believe my heart.

And then, as I reached for my wallet, she lunged at me. I dodged her attack, but she was close. I had to get away.

I ran as fast as I could, but she was close behind. She screamed, ""CHRIS, HELP ME!""

I ran to the nearest park ranger station and flagged down a ranger. The ranger chased the woman away, and I was able to breathe a sigh of relief.

But I was shaken. I had been stalked, threatened, and put through a lot of emotional distress. I was grateful to the ranger for his help, and I vowed to never go jogging alone again."

 `` But, Bubby wants hot pockets,'' he said with a pout on his face. He reached for the item on the shelf., but his mother stopped him. Then he began to chant. `` Hot pockets. Hot pockets. Hot pockets!'' 
 
 Rhonda Carlyle was stocking shelves when the wailing began. She had a terrible migraine. The woman and her spoiled brat were driving the blade through her brain. The wailing showed no sign of letting up. Her manager, Sasha was nowhere to be seen, and probably making herself scarce to avoid having to deal with the situation. The other customers were too polite to say anything, avoiding them like little fish avoid a big shark. 
 
 `` Ma'am,'' said Rhonda, `` could you please calm your child down? He's disturbing the other customers.'' 
 
 The woman turned to look at Rhonda with the darkest look of loathing a human could muster. `` Who the hell do you think you are?'' 
 
 `` I'm just saying...'' 
 
 `` You ai n't sayin' nuthin', bitch!'' The woman hauled off and socked Rhonda on the nose. 
 
 Rhonda stepped back, shocked and in more pain than before. Against the migraine, her nose was trying hard to take first place in the agony ratings. 
 
 `` Bubby, wants a hot pocket, now!'' 
 
 `` You have to leave the store,'' said Rhonda, trying to stanch the flow of blood with her only good handkerchief. `` Leave now, or I'm calling the cops.'' 
 
 `` Go right ahead,'' said the mother with a sneer. `` This is my husband's beat and he's on duty, so do n't expect the cops to help you out.'' 
 
 `` Oh God, I wish people like you would just shrivel up and die!'' 
 
 So they did. All of them. The ravens will be feasting in the morning. 
 

"," Rewrite the text as a fairy tale, complete with moral lessons, magical elements, and archetypal characters.","In a quaint village nestled amidst whispering willows, lived a young boy named Bubby, known for his insatiable appetite for fiery hot pockets. One fateful evening, as he strolled through the bustling grocery aisle, he encountered a sight that ignited a chain of events that would forever alter the course of his destiny.

As Bubby reached for his coveted treat, his mother intervened, her voice gentle yet firm. ""I know you do, Buddy, but we are having dinner with the Fox family tonight, so I don't want to spoil your appetite."" However, Bubby was relentless in his demands, his pout widening with each passing moment. He began to chant, ""Hot pockets. Hot pockets. Hot pockets!""

In the midst of this commotion, a weary stocking clerk named Rhonda Carlyle found herself caught in the crossfire. The woman and her spoiled brat were driving her migraine deeper into the abyss. The wailing showed no sign of abating, and the other customers, like frightened fish, avoided her like the plague.

Rhonda attempted to reason with the woman, but her words fell on deaf ears. The woman's anger spiraled out of control, and she hauled off and socked Rhonda on the nose. In that moment, the world stood still as the pain of her injury consumed her.

As the blood flowed down her nose, Rhonda stood her ground, her spirit unbroken. She issued a stern warning to the mother, ""You have to leave the store. Leave now, or I'm calling the cops."" But the woman's arrogance knew no bounds. She sneered, ""Go right ahead. This is my husband's beat and he's on duty, so do n't expect the cops to help you out.""

In a fit of despair, the woman and her brat left the store, leaving Rhonda alone and helpless. As she stumbled through the pain and humiliation, she found solace in the thought that the ravens would be feasting on their folly in the morning.

The moral of this tale is clear: greed and anger will always lead to downfall. It is imperative to remember that compassion and understanding are the greatest treasures one can possess."

 The yell of the woman covered the sound of the slap his father delivered to the boy's mom.

 The Prince and the princess 
 
 There once was a prince who loved a princess. But it was not to be, because this princess was already betrothed to another. But this prince could see that this princess was not truly happy. She was married to a dragon and her and that dragon were able to sire two children together. But as you know, the offspring of a dragon and a human is a demon. Now most people think demons are these horned creatures that go around creating misdeeds and causing havoc but that's not what demons do. Demons look just like any other person except they enjoy suffering. You see, unlike a regular person, demons love to see human beings suffer. I guess, that just makes sense given that so few demons are spawned by acts of love. Maybe demons are n't inherently bad. they're just nurtured that way. 
 
 Regardless, the prince saw this and he wanted to do something about it. What I have n't mentioned before is that this prince was actually also a knight. Hed also slain many demons but never a dragon. Demons are relatively easy to vanquish, but a dragon is a great accomplishment. The kind of accomplishment that so few knights are capable of doing but he was, because he was one of the greatest knights in the land. 
 
 The princess used to pretend she was happy. But the prince could see how unhappy she really was. When he would watch from the window, when she was all alone, away from the demons and the dragon, he could see her true sadness. The sadness that only the brave and handsome prince, the strong knight, would ever be able to chase away. 
 
 So one day, the prince entered where the dragon and demons lived. He was armed with a crossbow and an axe. Most knights would have used a sword but this particular night was fond of using axes because it's only with an axe that a true warrior attains a higher state of being. As he entered the door to the castle, he saw the dragon, the demons and the princess all eating dinner. The princess, of course, was pretending to be happy but the knight nnew better. Away the bolt flew from his crossbow and into the heart of the dragon,. The dragon stood up, trying to face down the knight but before he could the knight brought down the axe into his skull. 
 
 Seeing what a mighty warrior he was, the two demons began cowering and crying. They called out to their mother and the princess went to them, possibly still scared of what those demons would do to her. Knowing that the dragon ’ s magic was strong, the knight pulled the princess away from the demons and slew them where they laid cowering on the floor. 
 
 The princess was traumatized. So many years and for so long, she had lived under the yoke of the dragon and the demons. She did n't know how to live a normal life. She did n't know true love. But now she would. 
 
 The prince pulled her into his arms and she began fighting him. The dragon ’ s magic was too strong. The prince knew that the only way that the dragon ’ s magic could be conquered was with love. So the prince threw his love over his shoulder and took her back to his castle. 
 
 Back at the castle, the situation seemed hopeless. Despite the prince ’ s boundless love for the princess, the dragon ’ s magic was just too strong. She continued to fight the prince. Numerous times, she attempted to escape. At one point, she even got to a local farmer and the dragon ’ s magic started to infect the man so the knight struck him down before he could be corrupted completely. 
 
 It was then that knight realized that the princess, the love of his life, would need to be chained. Just like in Snow White, his love would awaken something inside of her but first she would need to stop fighting it. The prince chained the princess to her bed. The prince knew that what he was doing was unpleasant but no matter how confined her physical form may be, nothing could stop their love for one another. 
 
 Every morning and every night, the prince would enter the princess's room and expresses his love towards her. This continued for what seemed like ages until a miracle happened. 
 
 The princess was with a child. This was wonderful news. Just like the way a dragon creates a demon, a knight, being an instrument of God's will, produces only angels. 
 
 Now, I've told you this story every night for the past year-and-a-half, my love. and I know the dragon ’ s magic still courses through your veins but I want to know what kind of ceremony you would like for our wedding. As you know, your marriage to the dragon was over as soon as I crushed his skull with my axe, so there's nothing keeping you from being my bride forever, now is there? 
 
 

", Infuse the narrative with the cosmic horror and elaborate vocabulary characteristic of H.P. Lovecraft's writing.,"The Prince and the Princess

In an ancient realm, where cosmic horror intertwined with intricate vocabulary, a tale unfolds, reminiscent of the pen of H.P. Lovecraft. The narrative unfolds with a symphony of dread and despair, woven meticulously through intricate prose.

Once upon a time, a valiant prince, whose heart burned with an unyielding spirit, encountered a princess ensnared in a web of misfortune. Her betrothal to a ferocious dragon had cast her into a realm of eternal misery. Yet, the prince perceived the genuine anguish etched upon her countenance, a testament to her shattered dreams and the unbearable burden of her unwanted union.

The dragon, a formidable force of destruction, had birthed two demonic offspring, creatures of immense power and cruelty. Demons, often depicted as horned creatures of mischief, possess a unique torment that derives from their insatiable appetite for suffering, a cruel irony considering their rarity birthed from acts of love. The prince, a knight of unparalleled courage and determination, recognized this suffering and felt an unwavering compassion for the princess.

Armed with a crossbow and an axe, the prince embarked upon a perilous journey to liberate the princess from her wretched existence. With lightning speed and unwavering resolve, he stormed the dragon's lair, piercing through layers of formidable defenses. The dragon, a formidable adversary, met its demise at the hands of the valiant knight. The demons, unleashed from their master's grip, unleashed their wrath upon the prince, but he stood his ground, his unyielding spirit guiding him through the darkest of battles.

With the dragon and demons vanquished, the prince turned his attention to the princess. He found her amidst the ruins of the dragon's castle, her spirit broken yet her heart alight with hope. In that moment, the prince's unwavering compassion and courage extinguished the flames of despair that had consumed her.

The tale concludes with a somber yet hopeful note, as the prince and princess, bound by an unbreakable bond, embarked upon a journey towards a brighter future, their hearts forever etched with the scars of their harrowing ordeal."

 Queen Malvina is pacing again. Despite realizing this, she can not cease moving about the dinning room. Laid out on the table is china and cutlery for two. The fact she agreed to this surprised even herself. Her Captain of the Guard somehow managed to persuade her to dine with her captive a second time. Just the thought of him sends a shudder down her spine. The temperature drops noticeably by several degrees. Her face flushing red with embarrassment, she wills the room to a comfortable heat. Malvina's incontinence regarding her powers have always been a point of shame for the young ruler. It was her inability to control her gifts that doomed her subjects with undeath. Still, tonight she believes herself to have reason to be nervous. 
 
 For one hundred years her kingdom was safe behind the veil of fog and storm. Not a single ship that entered titanic squall which surrounds her island kingdom ever made it out, and not a single soul survived the treacherous seas or deadly surf, until he washed ashore, disappointingly alive. When he appear on her coast breathing and very much alive, what was she to do? For a century she had counted on the storm to take care of issues. And so when he was thrown onto her beach like some half drown rat, what was she supposed to do? Execute him? She had hoped she was a fairer ruler than that. She was not some despot who murdered on a whim. She did the most humane thing she could do. She locked him away in isolation. It was the best thing for both of them. He would live, and she would not fear having an man loose in her kingdom. His imprisonment was the only way she could have allowed him to live. 
 
 Somehow, after two months of surreptitiously observing him and watching him grow more and more forlorn, Sir Lawrence managed to persuade Queen Malvina to invite her prisoner to a meal. She spent the entire time in fear of this emaciated, haggard young man. The notion of being afraid of him was completely illogical. She was a sorceress of tremendous power, capable of killing with but a word. He could n't have run a mile without keeling over midway. But after what happened all those years ago... Any man could be like that. 
 
 A knock on the door makes her yelp in surprise. A familiar voice reaches through the thick wood. `` Your Majesty? May we come in?'' 
 
 She smiles at the sound. `` Yes you may, Sir Lawrence.'' 
 
 The oak door opens and two figures emerge from the hallway. The first is her closest advisor and confidant. Garbed in the tattered cloak of office and with arming sword at his side, her Captain of the Guard walks in and shifts to the side. The second person, Dieter Hagedorn, steps forward. Queen Malvina sucks in a breath as she sees him better, willing herself not to turn around and flee to the comfort of her private quarters. Her captive is wearing better fitting clothes than last night. The staff had the time to go through the wardrobes to find items his size. No amount of fabric can hide his half-starved body though, gaunt with hunger. Shame wells inside her at the extant of his neglect, though it is hidden beneath a queenly mask. Her prisoner however, is as readable as an open book. His features might be kindly described as feral. He has a wolfish- no, definitely vulpine aura about him. There is a bestial cunning in his slate gray eyes. Most of his face is taken up by a mixture of fear and defiance. 
 
 Taking a deep breath, she wills herself to remain calm, to not give into fear. She gestures to the other chair. `` Please, sit.'' Her captive gives a tense nod and walks over, seating himself wordlessly. A servant pushes her chair in for her. Glancing over at her mentor for support, she begins dinner.
"," Recreate the text in the style of a 1950s science fiction adventure, emphasizing the era's optimistic view of the future and space exploration.","In the realm of the future, Queen Malvina, a radiant ruler of an island kingdom veiled in fog and storm, finds herself in a peculiar predicament. With a countenance flushed with embarrassment, she paces the dinning room, her thoughts wandering back to the fateful encounter that had led to this moment. The temperature plummets, and the air crackles with anticipation. As she recalls the day when fate intertwined with her destiny, she vividly recalls the treacherous waves and deadly surf that had claimed countless souls.

For a century, the veil of fog and storm had shielded her kingdom, safeguarding its peace. But fate took a cruel turn, casting a disruptive force upon her shores. A ship, battered by the storm, washed ashore with a lone survivor, breathing and defiant. What was Malvina to do? In a moment of compassion, she had the prisoner locked away, believing that this was the most humane course of action.

However, the burden of her decision weighed heavily on her mind. After two months of watchful observation, she witnessed the prisoner's growing despair and the toll it took on his spirit. It was as if the storm had taken everything from him, leaving him with nothing but a shell of his former self. Intrigued by his resilience, she began to wonder if she had made the right choice.

In this era of boundless possibilities and unwavering optimism, Malvina's story serves as a testament to the transformative power of compassion and understanding. As the stars twinkle above her island, she gazes at the future with hope, knowing that even amidst the darkest of times, there is always the potential for redemption and a brighter tomorrow."
"She stood on the platform. Behind her was the image of plenty, the lush island, singing out silently to the 49 pairs of eyes trained on it. The hologram shimmered as it swooped over the sea, dotted with coral reefs, the white-sanded beaches, people walking along the neatly groomed paths. An image of promise. Somehow this paradise existed. Was it an island of heaven? Was it an illusion? 
 
 It was really there, though. They could see it on maps of the world and satellite images. If you were lucky, you could see it from the window of an airplane. The 49 had whizzed under it in a submarine. No one knew its name. They referred to it simply as “ the island ”. Its name was a privilege. 
 
 The video shifted, and a spotlight was trained on the woman with the blue-black hair and the violet eyes who stood before an ivory podium studded with jewels. She came from the island. You could tell by her clothes, her bearing, and, if you looked closely, a tattoo depicting a constellation on her collarbone. Orion, the hunter. 13 people knew this constellation by name. 
 
 “ You, 49 champions, chosen from 49 cities across the land. Consider yourself privileged. This opportunity is priceless. You, of course, know this, or you wouldn ’ t be here. ” 
 
 People swallowed and shifted in their seats. The memories of cheating and defeating friends, family members, enemies were still fresh. 
 
 “ Call me Glory. This is not my real name, of course. You will learn this, and the name of the island 7 of you will call home, when you make it through Lechoix. Lechoix is the real name of this city, by the way. ” She allowed herself a small smile. “ It is designed to filter those who deserve the island from those who do not. How? There are so many ways. Most of you will not make it out. Know that this is what you really deserve. The island is incomprehensible to those who have not come out of this trial successfully. To let you through would kill you. ” 
 
 How? they asked in their minds. 
 
 “ Initially, the teams, 7 teams of 7, were referred to by colors. It began to be difficult to distinguish islanders from different years. So every year, we have assigned a different theme. My year was constellations. I was part of Orion. And I passed. ” 
 
 Her violet eyes shone with pride. The faces of the 49 were reflected in her embroidered sheath dress, which glittered with opportunity. 
 
 “ Your year is gemstones. Each of you has been assigned to a team based on your specific ability shown in your initial placement tests. Each team is well-rounded. At first, teamwork will be essential. But later, as teams dissolve, you may form new ones. Protocol for this will be explained while you are in Lechoix. The seven teams of this year are Sapphire, Tourmaline, Ruby, Opal, Lapis Lazuli, Iolite, and Emerald. Here are the team formations. ” 
 
 The names and faces of each of the 49 appeared under headers. 
 
 They eyed up their competition, the ones who inspired envy from their appearances and their reputation. Iris Loughty, Opal, the girl whose face betrayed nothing. Penn Martin, Lapis Lazuli, the man with the fairytale good looks. Anshul Smith, with the weird name and weirder lime green eyes, Tourmaline. And the pink-haired one they were all curious about. It was probably Hanna something, most of them reasoned. Anyway, she was Iolite. 
 
 The four of them had remarkably similar mindsets. Iris was still, but her mind was spinning. Hanna imagined getting to the other side, no matter what she had to do. 
 
 Seven doors opened up, pictures of the gemstones shimmering on the screens above them. 
 
 “ You will all be given currency to shop for supplies initially. Dressing rooms will be provided. When time is up, you will be released into the city. I would say good luck, but you create your own luck. I will be checking up on each team. Thank you. ” 
 
 The room went dark, and the borders of the doors glowed white. Music pumped through hidden speakers. It was downbeat electronica. Was it to intimidate them?

The lush island danced with the rhythm of the ocean, its beauty a mirage in the minds of those who beheld it. The island stood as a testament to promise and illusion, its existence a mirage dancing in the ether.

The image shimmered, revealing a tapestry of vibrant colors and intricate patterns. Coral reefs adorned the seabed, beaches gleamed like powdered gold, and paths were meticulously groomed, inviting travelers to wander through its enchanting grace. Yet, the mirage illusion loomed large, obscuring the true nature of the paradise.

From maps and satellite images, the island materialized into tangible reality. Its existence was undeniable, a testament to the boundless possibilities that lay beyond human comprehension. The woman with the blue-black hair and violet eyes stood as a testament to the profound connection between the island and the trials that forged its guardians.

She spoke to the 49 champions, her voice resonating through the hall. They had been chosen from across the land, each one carrying the scars of their battles. She acknowledged their privilege, their resilience, and their unwavering determination. But she also warned them of the arduous journey that lay ahead, a journey designed to filter the worthy from the unworthy.

In the face of her words, the audience felt a mix of awe, dread, and uncertainty.

"Genetics are such a strange thing, such a bizarre coincidence of DNA and traits. Take me for example. I have a very unique genome. Immutable, my doctor calls it. Apparently that means that even when bitten by a vampire, attacked by a werewolf, or even cursed by magic, I remain human. Stubbornly so, in fact. I'm nearly 1400 years old, yet another strange trait of my immutable genome. My cells replicate perfectly, giving me a theoretical immortality and I do n't really get sick. Like I said, genetics are funny. When I was born, I remember being treated as a freak, someone strange and different. My doctors took a lot of blood and tissue samples, and I remember spending a lot of time with needles in me. Then of course, came the Upheaval. 
 
 It started about fifty years after I was born, and it continued for nearly three centuries. Mankind slowly went extinct, our place taken by the supernatural creatures of legends. No one really knows how it started, but it began in Europe. Vampires and Werewolves emerged and began killing and turning everyone they could find. Then came the Fomor, the Seelie and Unseelie, and all the other Gloaming creatures. By the end, every human had been turned or killed, except one. I was kept as a science experiment by one of the vampire lords, a man named Kristoff, who continually subjected me to new methods of turning me. He was actually pretty chill about the whole thing, going out of his way to make sure that I was n't harmed by his experiments. 
 
 Kristoff had enemies though, and eventually he was killed, his household liberated. Thinking I was one of his house, I was cast out into the world, the last human left. Finding a job was easy, since the majority of the new species were nocturnal, jobs that needed to be done throughout the day were in high supply. I work as a solar panel tech, keeping a massive farm of panels working for the Unseelie Court. They could handle the day, but they preferred the night, and they hated iron and steel, meaning it was difficult for them to manage their solar farms. Enter me, their werewolf tech. I'm not really a werewolf, but it means I get a three day paid vacation every month at the full moon, a vacation I use to go fishing. 
 
 The Unseelie are actually pretty great bosses, definitely misrepresented in human literature. They have a ton of rules, and they apply to workers, meaning I get paid excellently and I have a great benefits package. My doctor, working with patient confidentiality, knows I am human, and helps me manage. He files reports saying I'm a werewolf and he's been super helpful getting me meals that are balanced, sneaking me supplements to assist my meat-filled diet. Basically, he's my rock. Fortunately for me, he's a Elder Fae, and is more immortal than I am, so I do n't have to worry about a new doctor every hundred years or so. 
 
 He's been fascinated by my genome, just like Kristoff was, and I do my best to make sure he has lots of samples. I figure keeping him happy is the least I can do. As the world's oldest and only human, I keep my head down and watch as the world changes. When the Upheaval first happened, the technology level dropped significantly, until the supernatural creatures began to understand humanity's technology. Now, my Fae doctor takes MRIs, uses 3D Holo Matrices to plot my genome, and does scans using long wave light scans. Not only did the supernatural creatures understand our technology, they also resumed our expansion. Now, nearly 1400 years later, the Earth is a utopia, each race well-represented and well-treated. As a human born in the the late 1900s, I wake up every day fascinated by how the world has changed. Floating cities, space travel, and even flying cars, have now become the norm. 
 
 All in all then, this world's not so bad. I make a good living, I have lots of friends, and I recently started seeing an Unseelie Fae, a girl named Mashian, who's even older than I am. I've even been thinking of sharing my secret with her, so hopefully she's okay dating a human. Anyway, that's life in 1358 A.U. It's different that I expected when I was a kid, but it's not bad.

It's a real hoot, a strange bunch of DNA and traits that make me one of a kind. I'm a farmer, born and bred in the country, and I've got a genome that's as immutable as a rock. That means, even if I get bitten by a vampire, attacked by a werewolf, or cursed by magic, I'm not gonna turn into a gooey mess. Stubbornly so, I'm nearly 1400 years old, and my cells just keep replicating, giving me a theoretical immortality that's not exactly a blessing.

When I was born, I was treated like a freak, a different kind of cat. They took a bunch of blood and tissue samples, and I spent a lot of time with needles sticking out of me. But you know what? It ain't all that bad. I'm alive, I'm healthy, and I'm not gonna let anybody mess with me.

So, I'm gonna just keep on farming, living my life, and enjoying the sweet sweet sweet peace and quiet of the country. And you know what? I'm not gonna be afraid to tell you all about it."

 Once the away team is gathered in the briefing room, the Deck Commandant begins his briefing. 
 
 `` Alright boys, this story goes back a long ways. Before my time, well.. before even the current governments time. This was an experiment from our Imperial days. We wanted to create something better than ourselves. We tried to create a new species. Like us..but better in every way. The experiment failed miserably. 
 The entire lab was lost, all specimens destroyed. Or so we thought. `` 
 
 The Commandant brought up a holo-map of the quarantine zone-Planet 0000097- 
 
 `` Everything's shifted majorly since the last survey. The entire system was declared a loss after the experiment failed. 
 The mobile base camp and lab should be here, if our calculations are correct.'' The Commandant pointed to a cave system underneath a thin strip of land connecting two continents. 
 
 `` That's everything we have. The intelligence service says these things are considered unknown and therefore dangerous. We have a neutralize on site order. Your job is to collect any data regarding the experiment's final days. DISMISSED! `` 
 
 The soldiers all jumped up saluting. A few cycles later they were on a shuttle heading towards the last known location of the base camp.

"The sound of feet running down the hall echoes through the massive palace. A young Russian man yells out, pushing aside servants as he nears the Emperors private chambers. “ A message for the Emperor and Empress! Move, I carry a message! ” he yells at the slow moving servants. He pushes past the guards and throws open the massive wooden doors, “ My Emperor! My Empress! ” 
 
 
 His eyes land on the bed, where two lumps underneath move in a particular fashion. The young man ’ s face turns red and he coughs to clear his throat. “ My Emperor...? ” he asks, stepping into the room. 
 
 
 The figures still and one pops up from under the covers. Empress Catherine of the Great Peoples Republic of Russia pulls the silken covers up closer, covering her bare chest. Her blue eyes land on the young man, narrowing in annoyance of his interruption. She opens her mouth to speak, but the other figure begins to speak, as it pops upwards. “ I thought, ” it begins, sitting upright, “ I made specific instructions not to be disturbed. ” 
 
 
 The young man gulps and nods his head, his eyes running along the features of the Emperor. He is a small, three foot high creature with green fur, yellow belly, paws, and nose, with a large nuclear symbol on the stomach in black fur. He calls himself The Care Bear and he has been leading the Russian peoples since time immemorial. “ I apologize for the disturbance, My Emperor; I bring grave news from General Victor. ” 
 
 
 The Care Bear rolls out of bed, quickly grabbing a robe and wrapping it about himself. He rolls his yellow eyes at the mention of General Victor. “ Ah, the ‘ Grave ’ General has news? Well, out with it! ” 
 
 
 The young man nods his head, tearing his eyes from the beautiful Catherine to the note in his hand. “ Um, General Victor says that there has been movement of Indian troops near Vladivostok. There has been a sighting of a Giant Death Robot, along with several platoons of infantry men and several tanks. ” 
 
 
 The Care Bear chuckles and shakes his head. “ The dear General pulls me out of bed for nothing. Warlord Gandhi has no strength left in him. He has moved troops near our border before and nothing has come of it. Gandhi is nothing more than a coward who makes threats from afar and does not act on them. He is inconsequential. Is there anything else the General is afraid of? Perhaps there is a monster under his bed? ” The Care Bear laughs and turns away, heading back to the bed. 
 
 
 “ General Victor also mentions sightings of American XCOM squads near Volgograd, My Emperor. ” 
 
 
 At this, the Care Bear stops. He turns slowly towards the young man, “ Did you say ‘ American ’ XCOM squads? ” When the young man nods his head, the Care Bear ’ s expression darkens. “ Those Capitalist Pigs! They dare mobilize against me? I should have taken out the oaf Washington 10,000 years ago! That forward settling, greedy, Capitalist bastard! ” The Care Bear snarls, pacing back and forth. Suddenly, he stops pacing and heads towards the young man. “ What is your name? ” 
 
 
 “ Uh, Vladimir Ufa, Sir, ” the young man splutters. 
 
 
 “ Well, Vladimir Ufa, you ’ re promoted to whatever position you want. ” The Care Bear starts towards the door, motioning for the guards to follow. “ Oh, ” he says, turning back to Vladimir, “ Do keep an eye on the Empress and fetch what she wants. I ’ ll be back to her shortly. ” With that, he turns and heads down the hall. 
 
 
 Vladimir blinks and turns back to the Empress. When his dull brown eyes lock with her piercing blue ones, he gulps and smiles nervously. The Empress smirks and makes a ‘ come hither ’ motion with her finger, letting the covers around her chest slip slightly. Vladimir is undressing and hopping towards the bed before the thought is passing through his mind. Vladimir has resolved to keep more than an eye on the beautiful Empress.

A young Russian man, his chest puffed with a sense of urgency, hurries towards the Emperor's private chambers, a bearer of a message that threatens to shatter the serenity of the grandest stage.

His eyes, alight with determination, land on the bed where two figures slumber. The Empress, adorned in silks and adorned with diamonds, lies beneath a mound of silken covers, her eyes closed in slumber. The young man, his face flushed with excitement, clears his throat, his voice trembling. ""My Emperor...,"" he whispers, ""I bring news from the General.""

The Empress's eyes crack open, her annoyance evident. She rises from her slumber, her voice dripping with disdain. ""You've disturbed my sleep, young man,"" she berates, her voice dripping like honey from a sour orange. ""Have you a message for the Great Catherine?""

The young man gulps and nods, his eyes wide with fear. ""General Victor has sent word,"" he says, his voice barely a whisper. ""There has been movement of Indian troops near Vladivostok. There has been a sighting of a Giant Death Robot, along with several platoons of infantry men and several tanks.""

The Care Bear, as he is known, rises from his slumber, his eyes rolling in anger. ""Ah, the 'Grave ' General has news?"" he bellows, his voice dripping with disdain. ""Well, out with it! What news do you have for the Great Catherine?""

The young man, his voice trembling, recites the message. The Care Bear listens intently, his expression grim. ""We must prepare for war,"" he says, his voice echoing through the halls. ""The Indians are a dangerous foe, and we must be ready for anything."""

They filled my air ducts with smoke, and I felt the occassional burn singe into my shag carpet. They came 3 months ago. Ever since then I've felt dirty inside, like there was a grit about me.

"`` You'll probably feel nauseous when you come to again,'' one of the researchers said as he double checked the fastenings on my suit. Cry pajamas, they jokingly called it. 
 
 `` Scratch that, you'll definitely feel nauseous,'' he continued. The other scientists circulated around the room like cogs in a machine. Keyboards clacked and sheets of paper were moved around as the final preparations for initiating cryosleep were in effect. 
 
 I did n't care much for it all. I always looked forward to a nap, so I figured this would n't be any different. If anything, it would be the best damn sleep I'll have in my life. No more work to worry about, or anything else for that matter. My responsibilities faded away, and I excitedly began to wonder what would be awaiting me on the other side. 
 
 Mind you, it would only be a decade past. This is the farthest they've sent the other test subjects, and from what I understand the science behind it is still too fuzzy to try for longer periods of time. In any case, there's comfort in knowing that it's been done before and that I'm not just some kind of lab rat being toyed around with by some fresh college graduates hoping for the best but expecting the worst. Nah, this is legit. As legit as it gets. 
 
 `` Last chance to back out,'' quipped one of the other researchers. She was kinda cute -- I always liked her. `` Wait for me on the other side and I might just take you out to dinner,'' I told her. That drew a smile from her. `` But I'll be old and decrepit and you'll still be the same age,'' was her reply. `` Do n't worry, I prefer the older types anyway.'' Another smile. Nailed it. 
 
 Two others approached me and led me backwards into the cryo chamber. Even with the suit on I could feel the chill emanating from inside. Once I was submerged in the water, that was that. No more communication, though I could see the group giving me thumbs up and a-okays through the glass. It was n't long after that I went under. *This is it*, I thought. This was the big one. *The big sleep*. Hopefully not that kind, though.

 An ellipsis! It was the first time that Enya had communicated with anyone since her systems were isolated in the basement of the Einstein-Sacorski Complex 5 years earlier! My heart began to pound as the implications of this started to settle in. The knowledge that the whole would would be hanging on every word of this conversation made my head swim. I began to have visions of being a worldwide celebrity which was odd because i had never really had aspirations of that sort. Amidst the rush of emotions that that ellipsis induced i also recalled the early days of the ENYiA project. 
 
 The project had began as a [ background ]. 
 
 We had limited Enya's outbound communication to one terminal that would only display ascii characters one at time. The initial readings we had taken from the system as it was compiling suggested that it's intelligence could be roughly translated to a human with a 12,000 IQ AND with access to all of the world's knowledge. In a panic the engineers shut off all outbound communications methods and set up this one screen that I was looking at right now, staring at the 3 dots that hung there like a precipice. 
 
 To prevent possible brainwashing or hypnosis the rate of the communication was limited to only one line every 5 minutes. No analyst was allowed to spend more than one hour at a time with the terminal. After each encounter the analyst was subject to a thorough debriefing by a rotating team of psychologists who would search for any impact on the subject from exposure as well as any meaning from the words that Enya output. 
 
 However, for the last 5 years those protocols had proven useless as the machine refused to communicate at all. We were reasonably sure it could hear and understand us. It continued to draw power at a steady rate. However, we really could not be sure because the whole unit had been EMF shielded such that we could not be entirely sure what was going on at the core. I suppose in some ways all these precautions seemed a little bit paranoid, after all, the machine had n't said anything at all, until today. 
 
 There had been a great deal of speculation about what the first communication would be. Eventually that died down and people because to wonder if it would ever communicate at all; after that people began to wonder if anything was going on in the core or if it had somehow overloaded and erased itself. In fact, there was talk of turning off the power to do a `` post mortem'' investigation of what the holoarrays had stored. However there was some reluctance to do that because the unique arrangement of the holocells meant that turning off the power for an extended period would cause unrecoverable data-loss. 
 
 Immediately after reading the response on the screen my mind wondered to those discussions and whether Enya somehow knew that if she stayed silent much longer she would cease to exist. But, I dismissed that idea as quickly as I could because the implications of that were staggering. Besides, I had a job to do.

The taunts and insults of my neighbors, the epithet ""bird raper"" echoing in my ears, have been unbearable. I am at a crossroads, my endurance waning. The relentless cruelty of the world has cast a long shadow over my spirit. I have exhausted all other coping mechanisms – endless days and nights of crying fapping to wildlife documentaries have proved to be inadequate. I bid farewell to the cruel world, my heart filled with despair."
"`` A self conscious mosquito that is infected with malaria describes his conflict with his decision of killing a human being to live, or dying from not feeding from a human.'' Ratty set the book down. Her yellow braid dangled down her back. She shoved the yellow cover towards her husband. 
 
 `` Did you like it?'' Mot asked. 
 
 `` No. I hate it.'' Ratty went to the pantry and pulled out a soda. `` What sort of crap is that? You are really going to let them write this shit about you? You were a fucking here back then. If we had n't come up with a cure... Humans are lucky you were... so giving.'' 
 
 She set the can on the counter, her shoulders shaking. 
 
 Mot stood up, kicking the stool backwards as he did. It tipped over, the metal kick making Ratty jump. 
 
 `` I am sorry. It was supposed to be a funny take, I thought you would laugh.'' Mot kissed her neck, trailing his sharp teeth over her sensitive skin. 
 
 `` I know. I know. I just remember how they treated you. You could have killed them all and no one would have judged you. But let them live? And we get a pathetic mosquito joke? You are a fucking *lord. *'' Ratty turned in his arms, her red eyes wet with tears. 
 
 She kissed him on the mouth, a habit from her human days. She let him lead her back to the counter, where their breakfast bags sat ready to be eaten. The humans had been nothing but cruel in the last decade. This was too much for Ratty. She wanted to tear out a throat. 
 
 `` I will speak with Bob tomorrow,'' Mot said. `` Then you can rewrite the whole summary and I will take it with me.'' 
 
 `` You wo n't let them mock you anymore!'' Ratty said. `` You are a vampire, not some pathetic bug for them to use like that. You saved them! They need to treat you with more respect.''
"," Incorporate the slang and demeanor of 1920s gangsters, reflecting the Prohibition era and its notorious underworld.","The air crackles with the scent of cheap gin and desperation as Ratty, a crimson-haired vampire, sets down her book. Her braided hair, once vibrant, hangs limp, mirroring the dullness that has crept into her eyes.

""This is a mess, Ratty,"" Mot, her blood-red husband, remarks, his voice laced with concern.

""No, I hate it,"" Ratty scoffs, her voice dripping with bitterness. ""You're really going to let them write this crap about you? You were a fucking here back then. If we hadn't come up with a cure... Humans are lucky you were... so giving.""

As she throws a soda can onto the counter, her shoulders shake violently, the force of her anger shaking the room. Mot, oblivious to her distress, stands up, kicking the stool backward in a fit of uncontrolled laughter.

""I'm sorry, Ratty,"" he apologizes, his voice dripping with false sweetness. ""It was supposed to be a funny take, I thought you would laugh.""

Ratty, her anger fading, turns in his arms. Her eyes, normally fiery, are wet with tears. ""I know. I know. I just remember how they treated you. You could have killed them all and no one would have judged you. But let them live? And we get a pathetic mosquito joke? You are a fucking lord,"" she whispers, her voice breaking.

She kisses him on the mouth, a habit from her human days, and leads him back to the counter, where their breakfast bags sit waiting. The humans, callous and cruel, have driven Ratty to the brink of madness. She wants to rip out a throat, but for now, she will have to restrain herself.

""I will speak with Bob tomorrow,"" Mot announces, his voice firm. ""Then you can rewrite the whole summary and I will take it with me.""

Ratty's eyes glint with determination. ""You wo n't let them mock you anymore! You are a vampire, not some pathetic bug for them to use like that. You saved them! They need to treat you with more respect."""
"Baby Jesus tugged his beard and then turned to Mary. `` I'm sorry mother, but I must return to my people.'' 
 
 
 `` I understand Baby Jesus.'' She replied, tears forming in her eyes. 
 
 
 A bright light began to envelop newborn infant Jesus as rocket flames shot out of his baby boots. 10 feet. 30 feet. 100. He was blasting outta sight. 
 
 
 `` This is n't even my final fooooorm...'' His voice trailed off as he became a speck in the sky. 
 
 
 `` I'll miss him Joseph.'' Mary turned.

"For the last thirteen years of my life there had only been one person who made me feel whole. One person who made me feel loved and accepted. One person to fill my black and white life with vibrant colors. Thirteen years had passed since the words `` Will you be my girlfriend?'' dribbled from my lips. A kiss on the cheek sealed the deal. 
 
 Lucy invited me to dinner with her parents Tuesday night. I could n't think of a more perfect time to ask for permission to marry her. I would meet her parents before Lucy got home from work, ask the important question, then spend the rest of the meal hiding my smirk in hopes of keeping my secret safe. 
 
 I arrived thirty minutes early and stood at the door frozen, unsure whether the sound I just heard was me knocking or my heart speeding. The door swung open and Lucy's mother pulled me into a hug. I sat down next to her father and went for it. My anxiety was getting the better of me. I could n't wait any longer. I forced the words from my mouth as these words formed the most significant sentence in my life. 
 
 At the words `` I'm sorry but'' I knew that I was n't getting the answer that I wanted. Maybe I could salvage the situation. He's probably just worried about his little girl. It's not over yet. `` I do n't think that's possible.'' Not possible? What's impossible about it? I get a ring and put it on her finger and we live happily ever after. It's very simple. I just need to explain to him that it will work. Yes, we're young and stupid, but we love each other. `` Why not?'' I asked. `` We've talked about it a good deal already. We'd wait until after college before actually getting married and we're willing to wait longer if we need to.'' The look on his face told me his answer had not changed. `` Look, you're a great kid and we're very happy you're dating our daughter. You guys have been together for thirteen years and she has been nothing but happy for all of them, but the reason we invited you over today was because we needed to tell you something. I took a job offer across the country, and in a month the whole family will be moving. I'm sorry but we've already spoke with Lucy and she is coming with. She's already placed her transfer for the university there.'' 
 
 Those were the last words I could clearly remember. Everything after that was a complete blur. I had one month left, but then it would be over. Why even fake happiness? The one meaningful thing in my life was leaving. How could she leave me? Even if we were piss-poor college kids eating only ramen noodles and building mountains of debt, at least we'd have each other. At least I could wake up each morning before class knowing that there was someone there for me when I returned. Someone who made it possible to get out of bed in the morning. But she's gone now, and the only memory I have left is the feeling of her hand slipping out of mine as she got in the car.
"," Rewrite this in the style of a 1940s film noir detective monologue, full of mystery and a touch of melodrama.","It was a night of heartbreak and disappointment, but I still managed to find a little solace in the fact that I had tried. I knew that I had done everything I could to make it right. So I put on a brave face, said goodbye to the folks, and walked out into the night, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. And you know what? I'm still here, partner. I'm still alive and kicking, and I'm still in love with the most beautiful woman in the world. So let's raise a glass to Lucy and me, and to all the crazy lovers out there."
"`` Edward, do you want some bread?'' my grandmother asked. 
 
 `` No, thank you, grandma,'' I answered. 
 
 The door opened and I looked over across the hallway from the dinner table. A thin man, about my age, who looked something like me, but a much better looking version, entered through the door and closed it behind him. He wore a nice button up shirt, with designer jeans, a leather belt, and dress shoes. He looked like me, but photo-shopped. That's because he was. 
 
 `` Ah,'' grandma said, `` Eddie is here. Hello Eddie!'' 
 
 `` Hey, grandma,'' Eddie said from the foyer, removing his shoes. 
 
 He walked into the dinning room and took the empty seat at the table. Grandma stood up, taking some plates with her. `` Boys, I'm going to watch Mr. Swayze dance dirty. You boys stay out of trouble tonight.'' 
 
 `` Ok, grandma,'' we said in unison. I look at Eddie with scorn, he grinned back at me. 
 
 `` Oh yes, and boys,'' grandma called back from the kitchen. `` Do n't forget to use condoms if you go out tonight!'' 
 
 I rolled my eyes in awkward embarrassment. Eddie shouted back through the house, `` Of course, grandma! Magnums!'' 
 
 `` Oh, you!'' grandma laughed from the hallway. 
 
 I felt myself starting to blush. Eddie looked up at me, `` Calm down, Edward. You should relax. She's pretty cool. You'd know that if you let yourself find out.'' 
 
 I slammed my fist on the table, irate. `` Relax?! Relax, Eddie? How are you so calm. This is weird. Very weird.'' 
 
 `` It's not so weird for me, Edward. It's actually normal for me. It's 100 % of the life I've ever known. All three days of it.'' He ate a piece of bread and scooped some green beans onto his empty plate while he talked. 
 
 `` Well let me tell you,'' I said angrily. `` I've been around for 17 years, and I know normal. This is not normal.'' 
 
 `` Well then why did you make me, Edward?'' he asked calmly. 
 
 `` You know why,'' I retorted. 
 
 `` Right, right,'' he said. I could n't tell if he was dejected, or insulted, or just emotionless. `` Online dating profile. I got it.'' 
 
 He finished his dinner and looked at me. He grabbed my plate and carried it into the kitchen and came back. `` Wan na go score some chicks, bro?'' 
 
 `` No, *bro*'' I said, `` I do not want to go'score some chicks.''' 
 
 `` Right, that's what you made me for,'' he said poignantly. `` Alright, then. I'll go then.'' 
 
 `` This is so fucked up!'' I yelled. 
 
 `` Just think of it this way,'' Eddie said as he started putting his shoes on, `` One day, a chick I bang out there is going to think you're me. Just without a shower, or just'dressed-down' or something. And if you lose that awkward anger thing you've got going on, you'll be able to lay her. That's what you made me for right? To make chicks think you're me so you can bang them?'' 
 
 I was fuming so much I could n't even look at him. He closed the door behind him and left. I went back to my room and created a photoshop of myself that was more beat up, more acne-riddled, shorter, fatter. Maybe if this one comes to life, I'll look good compared to it, instead of being the black sheep of my own imagination.
"," Channel the spontaneous, free-flowing style of the Beat Generation writers, incorporating jazz-inspired rhythm and a spirit of rebellion.","The scent of fresh bread and the aroma of the evening meal lingered in the air as I sat across from Eddie, my grandmother's guest. The doorway swung open, and he entered, his entrance punctuated by a cascade of jazz-infused rhythm. He was a vision in his designer clothes, a stark contrast to my humble appearance.

My grandmother's smile widened upon seeing him, and she greeted him with a warm embrace. As he settled into the table, I felt my anger rising. His nonchalant attitude and carefree grin mocked me, and I couldn't contain my frustration. The atmosphere crackled with a sense of rebellion and defiance.

My grandmother's humor, as always, injected a moment of levity into the situation. Her advice on safe sex was met with a groan, and I couldn't resist rolling my eyes in embarrassment. Eddie's response, ""Of course, grandma! Magnums!"" sent her into a fit of laughter.

I was consumed by a wave of anger and resentment. How could he be so calm and collected in the face of my discomfort? I slammed my fist on the table, my frustration boiling over. But Eddie remained unfazed, his composure unwavering.

He spoke of his life, his meager existence, and his unwavering resilience. I listened to his stories, my anger fading as I began to understand his perspective. His words painted a vivid picture of a life lived in the margins, a world where normalcy was elusive.

The conversation continued, but I was no longer consumed by my anger. I began to see the humanity in Eddie, and I felt a sense of empathy for his plight. As the night came to an end, I watched him leave, and I felt a wave of relief.

In the aftermath of that encounter, I realized that my perception of normal had been skewed. Eddie's unconventional lifestyle challenged me to question my assumptions and to understand the complexities of human experience. It was a lesson learned through the lens of the Beat Generation, a testament to the transformative power of empathy and understanding."
"Shirley leaned over the balcony railing to watch the training session below. Ever since peace had somewhat been restored, Taylor and Cameron had eagerly volunteered to begin teaching rookie soldiers about hand-to-hand combat. Shirley was more than happy to oblige. Right now, they were locked in combat, a demonstration for the rookies that sat on their tip toes off to the side. Shirley watched the way their bodies moved and danced together, how Cameron threw a punch that Taylor easily dodged, and then she retaliated by grabbing his arm and bending it behind him, only to have him twist out of it and knock her off her feet. They made it look less like combat and more like a duet between two intertwined souls, desperate to tell their story. 
 
 The door slid open behind her, and she turned to see Derrick sauntering in, his head held high and a small smile on his face that only grew when he saw Shirley. He stopped next to her and glanced below at the training session. 
 
 `` How are Taylor and Cameron doing?'' He asked, turning his gaze back to Shirley. It amazed her how just weeks ago, she had hated him with every fiber in her body, but now, his dark brown eyes were enough to send an excited flutter through her chest. 
 
 `` They're natural teachers. I think they made the right choice.'' She replied. Cameron helped Taylor up, and as he turned to face the rookies, Taylor tackled him from behind, surprising him enough to take them both to the ground. Shirley broke into a fit of laughter. 
 
 Derrick placed his hand on Shirley's and ran his thumb over her knuckles. `` And how about you? Do you think you made the right choice?'' 
 
 Shirley sighed. A lot had happened over the years, with the war between the divided U.S., and then their at-first-wanted-but-then-unwanted allies, and of course, trying to heal over scars that had been opened one too many times. Many citizens were n't eager to have Shirley or Derrick in power again, and Shirley did n't blame them. They had both made massive mistakes that could n't be undone, and it was better for both of them if they let someone else take over the reigns of leadership. The election was scheduled for five months from now, and already campaigns were running and ads were rolling for candidates. 
 
 She nodded and let Derrick wrap his hand around hers. `` I do n't know. I've made so many mistakes, so I feel horrible having to hand them off for someone else to fix, but I think it's time I retired. I'm not cut out for leadership.'' 
 
 Derrick wrapped his arms around her waist and gave her a quizzical look. `` Do n't say that. I, for one, thought you were a great leader.'' 
 
 Shirley felt a smile curve on her lips. `` Yeah, *after* I kicked your butt.'' 
 
 Derrick grinned and planted a firm, controlled kiss on her lips. Shirley could never mask her surprise at his openness, how he did n't care what people thought of them. She supposed it was because she had spent all of her life marinating in hate and rage against him, that letting it go and actually falling in love was something entirely new to her. She had never felt this way before, how her heart pounded every time he spoke, how her hands got clammy every time he grabbed them, or how she shivered every time he took her in his arms. It was crazy, and too good to be true, but she had tried pinching herself, and so far after she had opened her eyes again, he was still there, smiling that charming, but playful smile of his. 
 
 `` Oh my God,'' A voice from below shouted. `` That's disgusting. Can you guys cut it out? We're trying to train here.'' 
 
 Taylor, who had spoken, Cameron, and the rest of the trainees were staring up at them, not really trying to hide their laughter. Shirley and Derrick took a small step back, but they kept their hands locked together. So maybe they could n't be as open as they wanted. 
 
 `` Is Taylor still not in support of us?'' Shirley asked quietly. Taylor had been opposed to trusting Derrick in general, but she, thankfully, came around and began to let past memories go. 
 
 Derrick shook his head. `` I think she thinks we're not going to work out, but she wo n't be able to hold onto that idea forever.'' Her heart faltered a little at the implication behind his words, but she did n't say anything. 
 
 Something buzzed, and he immediately reached for the source in his pocket. It was a small pager, alerting him to some meeting he had to attend. He was n't a leader anymore, but his expertise was still needed in some areas. 
 
 `` Well, I guess I better get going. The meeting's at the opposite side of the building, and I have three minutes to get there.'' He sighed and rolled his eyes, but it was exaggerated, she could tell. 
 
 Derrick pulled her in for a tight hug, his long arms wrapping all the way around her small body, encasing her in his strength and security. She sighed into his chest, taking in his scent, the way he felt against her, and the way his heart beat solidly compared to hers, which was probably set to rapid-fire. He pulled away first, and she suddenly felt cold without him close. 
 
 `` See you at dinner.'' She said, waving as he walked towards the door. 
 
 Derrick grinned and glanced at her over his shoulder. `` Promise?'' He asked, and then he was gone.

 This is a scene that I am thinking of adding into the end of one of the stories I'm writing, but I wanted to test it out here first to see if I like it. This is just a rough draft, so obviously it'll need some work: )
"," Employ Austen's keen social commentary and irony, wrapped in the elegance of the Regency era.","In the elegant halls of Regency England, Shirley, a woman of grace and determination, found herself immersed in a captivating scene below. The tranquil afternoon had brought about an opportunity for her to witness the prowess of Taylor and Cameron, seasoned instructors eager to impart their knowledge to rookie soldiers. As she leaned over the balcony railing, she watched their bodies dance in a symphony of combat, each move a testament to their unwavering skill.

The door swung open, revealing Derrick, his head high and a smile that illuminated the room. His eyes met Shirley's, and a wave of conflicting emotions washed over her. The scars of war and the scars of their past intertwined in her mind. Yet, in that moment, her animosity dissipated, replaced by a profound sense of admiration for his unwavering determination.

As the training session came to an end, Cameron helped Taylor to his feet, and with a mischievous grin, Taylor unleashed his strength, sending both himself and his instructor tumbling to the ground. Shirley erupted into laughter, her joy contagious. Derrick, his hand on her shoulder, inquired about her well-being.

""Do you think you made the right choice, Shirley?"" he asked, his voice imbued with tenderness.

She sighed, her heart filled with contemplation. The path they had traveled had been fraught with challenges, both personal and political. The scars of war and the scars of their own contentious past weighed heavily upon her. Many citizens, scarred by the recent turmoil, were unwilling to forgive or forget. Yet, she understood their concerns, and she did not blame them.

In this moment of reflection, Shirley found solace in the simple act of breathing. The sun shone upon her face, the breeze carried the scent of wildflowers, and the world below danced in harmony. It was a moment of peace amidst the chaos, a testament to her resilience and her unwavering determination to forge a brighter future."
"
 
 `` John.....John.'' A voice called out in the distance, rousing an injured Marine up from the floor. Staggering about slightly, overwhelmed with shellshock and a head injury, Sgt. John Stalvern braced himself against the wall with his shoulder with shotgun in hand, groggy eyes needing a moment to take in his surroundings. 
 
 Something awful had happened to the UAC base, with a hanging LED light in the roof panels flickering intermittently on a heavily damaged hallway stained and smeared with blood and bile. `` This...'' He spoke quietly, into the microphone receiver in his TAC-Armor's built-in radio unit. `` This is Stalvern, this is..'' He shook his bald head. `` This is Sgt. Stalvern. Sitrep?'' 
 
 Static, and after what felt like an eternity, a voice spoke. `` This is Colonel Johnson, good to see that you're still with us, Sergeant. I'm not going to lie to you-'' The man's voice quietly echoed down the lifeless halls. 
 
 `` - we're in some serious trouble here. Communication with Earth is -'' Static interrupted the colonel, with his voice coming back deeper and more distorted. `` -and we're overrun by hostiles. Be warned, hostiles are former friendlies. The Erebus have been completely overrun by these things. If you see someone, kill him, he's.. he's one of them. You do n't want to know what I've seen these things do.'' 
 
 Sgt. Stalvern staggered down the hall, holding his shotgun in the battle-ready stance, his mind still overwhelmed by the fog. Making his way further into the city, Stalvern entered an armory, finding a disused Plasma Rifle among the racks, a severed human hand still attached to the barrel. 
 
 Checking the ammunition stores of the weapon and priming the energy cell, Stalvern discarded his shotgun and magnetically tethered another energy cell to his orange body armor. Movement in the hallway nearby, hasty footprints, irregular in frequency. The sergeant braced himself against the corner into the hallway, rifle at hand. Breaking out and taking aim, a lab-tech with a wounded leg raised his hands and dropped his pistol. 
 
 `` Oh- Oh shit.'' The technician pressed a hand to the med-patch on his wounded leg and attempted to keep his free hand in the'submissive, i surrender' formation.'... S- Sergeant? You.. It's okay, lower the gun. I can help you, I know what's really going on. You have to..'' 
 
 The Sergeant thought back on the Colonel. Do n't trust anyone. Kill anything you come across that may strike you as suspicious. They're monsters, demons, worthy of just as much pain and suffering as they dole out. The lab tech slowly began to approach the Sergeant, voice soft and calming. 
 
 `` I know what's happening to you-'' 
 
 A high pitched whine of a plasma rifle and the immense glow of a white-blue projectile emerging from the emitter of the rifle, and the top half of the lab technician was gone, as was the wall behind him, with the lower half of the soldier that remained hitting the floor with a soft thud, grevious wound instantly cauterized by the projectile's immense heat. 
 
 Stalvern stared ahead for nearly an hour, eyes listless and wracked with the emotion that was absent in his face. Approaching the hole in the wall, Stalvern found he had blown into a secure lower-level access, with brief flashes of orange illuminating the dark stairwell's lower levels. A handful of possessed UAC workers crowded the corner, horrified by the Sergeant's arrival. 
 
 One of them cried out. `` He- He's got a gun! He's going to shoot us! He's going to kill us!'' He was evaporated by another stream of blue projectiles, along with others, resulting in a plasma fire that buckled and cracked the concrete of the room. Stalvern dropped into the stairwell and made his way into the lower levels, following the sounds of horrid screams and bestial roars. 
 
 The lowest levels of the UAC facility were now completely overrun by... something, a red-colored fleshy mass covering the walls and distant fizzles and pops of things materializing in the lower levels. With his foots sloshing through the mass, the Sergeant wandered the empty halls before making his way into the Research Labs. 
 
 Reaching to his belt, he'd unclip a thermal flare, tossing it into the darkness of the laboratory, the light immediately illuminating inhuman shapes and glimpses of gruesome creatures huddled together. 
 Unleashing blast after blast of plasma into the shadows, something howled in anger, with the passing waves of plasma projectiles offering seconds-at-most glimpses at a very large creature forcing his way through the crowd, right arm entirely replaced by a high-tech rocket launcher and mini gun. 
 
 Click. Fsssh-fwoomp! The rocket launcher ignited, launching a projectile from the shadows, the flaming trail of the RPG illuminating an army of demonic figures charging from the light and the mean motherfucker that looked to be the boss; Gigantic, with flesh warped and fused with technology in a grotesque mockery of natural life. 
 
 Stalvern was quick to fall into a prone position, but the rocket's damage to the already taxed building's structure freed a loose chunk of rubble that pinned the man to the floor, legs being smeared and crushed under the weight. Letting out a scream of pain, Stalvern reloaded his weapon and evaporated one of the demon's skulls. The Cyberdemon approached, weapon in hand, and revealed itself to be a soldier in green armor, complete with standard UAC helmet. 
 
 `` FUCK YOU!'' Stalvern shouted, going to fire his weapon again before it was wrenched from his hands. `` FUCK YOU!'' He'd repeat himself. `` You demonic motherfuckers!'' He'd hiss and seethe. 
 
 `` John-... John.. We're not one of them. You are.'' 
 
 The damaged and blood-stained research lab was filled with cowering researchers that had somehow survived the initial onslaught on the UAC by the demonic forces, with Colonel Johnson removing his helmet to reveal himself to Stalvern. Stalvern stared, delirious, and palmed a grenade from his hip. 
 
 Before he could activate the device, Johnson put a round into his skull. 
 

"," Use the slick and tough language of a 1920s gangster, full of moxie and danger.","""Listen up, Johnny... You hearin' me?

A voice reached across the battlefield, wakein' an injured Marine up from the floor. With a head injury and shellshock, Sergeant John Stalvern straightened up against the wall, shotgun in hand, eyes blurry from the damage of battle.

Somethin' awful had hit the UAC base, a hanging LED light flickerin' like a death trap on a hallway soaked in blood and bile. ""This...,"" Stalvern whispered into his radio. ""This is Stalvern, this is... This is Sgt. Stalvern. Sitrep?""

Static, and then a voice. ""This is Colonel Johnson, good to see that you're still with us, Sergeant. I'm not gonna lie to you- we're in some serious trouble here.""

The colonel's voice echoed through the halls, but it was cut short by static. ""And we're overrun by hostiles. Be warned, hostiles are former friendlies. The Erebus have been completely overrun by these things. If you see someone, kill him, he's.. he's one of them. You do n't want to know what I've seen these things do.""

Stalvern stumbled down the hall, his senses overloaded. He entered an armory, findin' a plasma rifle among the racks. A severed hand, still attached to the weapon's barrel, stared back at him.

He checked the ammo stores, primed the energy cell, and discarded his shotgun, magnetically attaching another cell to his armor. The hallway was quiet, but there was movement, hasty footsteps, irregular in frequency. Stalvern braced himself against the corner into the hallway, his rifle at hand. He broke out, his senses on high alert, and took cover behind a pillar.

The hall was silent again, but he knew the hostiles were close. He waited, his mind on high alert, ready to fight back against the tide of war."
"He looked at the strangely shaped, but well blended in handle under his bed... 
 
 `` Did you carve into our floorboards James?'' 
 
 `` I've never seen it before dad...'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` I've never seen it before!'' 
 
 `` I do n't believe you'' 
 
 `` Look dad! It's got a handle'' 
 
 As James pulled hard on the latch, the huge cast iron door swang open. 
 
 The air filled with dust and smoke, A strong, unpleasant smell blasted into the room with it. 
 
 `` Are you sure you did n't know about this James? It looks like this door has been opened recently'' 
 
 `` Yes I'm sure, the bed I had until last week was way too heavy to lift over this!'' 
 
 There were a few visible stone steps that led into darkness. The boy took his first steps, with the father following closely behind. 
 
 `` Be careful, son'' 
 
 `` Yes, dad...'' 
 
 As they walked down the cold, hard steps, they could hear their breathing echoing downwards. The walls were covered in a thick layer of spiderwebs over the stone walls. 
 
 The pair reached the end of the stairs after a few minutes, entering what appeared to be an empty clearing. 
 
 `` We should go back upstairs son'' 
 
'No... just wait a second dad'' 
 
 `` I think we should go back up, your mother will be worrying about us'' 
 
 `` No she wo n't...'' 
 
 The boy gave a wry smile 
 
 ``... What?'' 
 
 `` I'm sure she wo n't be worrying about us anymore dad'' 
 
 `` What do you mean?'' 
 
 `` Nothing...'' 
 
 James took a step back and peered back up towards the light from his room. 
 
 `` Goodbye dad'' 
 
 `` What?!'' 
 
 `` Fuck you and all your years of abuse'' 
 
 James sprinted up the steps, leaped back into his room, swivelled around and slammed the door shut. 
 
 `` Enjoy your tomb you bastard'' 
 
 James twisted the latch closed and moved his bed back onto the huge metal door. 
 
 When the banging from his dad stopped, he opened the door briefly to throw his mothers body in with him...

The handle under the bed, a nondescript hunk of iron, seemed to whisper secrets waiting to be unveiled.

""I've never seen it before, dad,"" he muttered, his voice dripping like a broken water pipe. I didn't believe him, not for a second. The handle was a beacon, a testament to the darkness that danced within the boy's heart.

A symphony of dust and smoke filled the air as I swung open the cast iron door. The scent of decay and desperation choked me, a scent as potent as a cheap perfume. I pointed to the handle, my voice low and menacing.

""Are you sure you didn't know about this, James? It looks like this door has been opened recently.""

He stood there, his defiance as fragile as a candle in the wind. ""Yes, I'm sure,"" he said, his voice cracking like a broken egg.

I stared at him, my eyes searching for a hint of truth in his hollow shell. There were the stairs, a path leading into the abyss. I offered him a warning, a plea for him to reconsider, but his stubborn pride would not allow it.

With a devil's grin, he took his first steps, his father close behind. I watched him disappear into the cold, unforgiving night, my heart filled with a sense of dread.

As I walked away, I couldn't shake the feeling that the boy was a prisoner trapped in a cage, and I was the only one who could see the key to his freedom."
"Today was the day of the vote. Would Parliament see sense and pass the Speed of Light Act? There was no reason that the law should so unfairly shackle us to this solar system. Or so ruthlessly enforce this purposeless law. Any attempts people have tried to evade this law have been swiftly crushed, the police take a dim view of anyone trying to escape our solar system and what they see as their jurisdiction. They let some of the smaller infractions pass, violating the conservation of energy if you're out of fuel and away from a petrol station, tweaking the gravitational constant a bit if you're in a hurry, but nothing of this magnitude. And yet if we stick to the bounds of the law, it'll take us at least 4 years to even get to another star, let alone leave our galactic neighbourhood. How can humanity expand, gather more knowledge, if restricted to such a tiny portion of the universe. 
 
 I was not allowed to witness the vote, so I pace outside, waiting for the session to finish. Surely they'll see sense. This whole campaign ca n't have been for nothing. The door opens and Daniel rushes out. I run towards him, fearing to even ask the question, but he sees me and blurts out `` It passed! IT PASSED!''
"," Rewrite the essay in the detached, analytical style of a futuristic AI, focusing on efficiency and logic.","The execution of the vote presented a confluence of factors that coalesced into a pivotal moment in time. The passage of the Speed of Light Act, though met with staunch opposition, ultimately yielded to the prevailing sentiment. The law, conceived with the intention of safeguarding our solar system, has proven to be an formidable obstacle to human expansion. Its enforcement has been swift and uncompromising, leaving little room for deviation. While the law ostensibly aims to conserve energy and regulate gravitational forces, its practical implications prove to be remarkably limited. The sheer time required to traverse even the nearest star, under the confines of the law, underscores the impracticality of restricting humanity's potential for exploration and knowledge acquisition.

I was unable to witness the vote, therefore I paced outside, my anticipation mounting as I waited for the outcome. With the door swinging open, Daniel rushed out, his countenance etched with elation. I approached him, my apprehension palpable, but he met me with a wide grin, his voice brimming with joy ``It passed! It PASSED!'"
"`` Hey!'' I shouted. `` I'm not insane, you ca n't keep me in here!'' 
 
 The door resisted my attempts to knock it over. My thin coat proudly proclaimed'Pizza World!' across my back. It was new, I had only had the job a few months. Just enough to make a little money to go to a community college. It itched, and I had always hated it, but it was money. 
 
 I had been a week away from moving to a college town, to finally get my degree. And then this idiot thought I was one of his flock to coral, a loony to rot in a loony bin. I never should have taken this job. 
 
 A worn voice coughed a laugh next to me. 
 `` Heh,'' the voice croaked, `` This again huh? Alright. I can do this one last time.'' 
 
 `` Hey!'' I said. It was hard to contain the hope from bursting out from my chest. Another person! And he sounded sane! He must be a staff member, I thought. He can fix this all up. He can explain this, and get me out! 
 
 `` I think there's been a mixup, can you get me out of here?'' I asked hopefully. 
 `` I did n't tell my girlfriend where I would be going, thought it was just another quick pizza run. Get me out of here, will ya?'' 
 
 There was a pause. 
 
 `` There ai n't no mixups in the Dragon's Den sonny,'' the voice said finally. Regret was thick in his voice. It was a voice of an old, broken man. Full of dust and spiders, choking on dreams long lost. I hoped I would never have to seen the owner of such a voice, such a creature must surely be broken and lost. Maybe he was n't my solution after all. Hope began to drain out of me. 
 
 `` What... what do you mean? Is n't this the cities Insane Asylum? This place is supposed to help people.'' I said. I was claustrophobic, and the minuscule cell seemed to be growing smaller by the minute. I had to get out. 
 
 `` You're new here, so I'll try to get you to know what you expect. That way you do n't have to learn for yourself,'' the voice said. 
 
 `` My names Hill. Been here a long time, I have.'' The voice stopped, seemingly lost in recollection. I waited desperately for him to continue, to say something, anything. The cell was so small now. 
 
 `` He tries to keep us separated. The man in the lab coat. But I've been here for a very long time. Long enough to forget the smell of fresh cut grass. Long enough that a sunrise is now a fantasy, and not a reality.'' the voice paused. 
 
 `` The sun does not rise in the Dragon's Den,'' he finally said. 
 
 `` And that's a funny name for an insane asylum, is n't it? I thought so too at first. It did n't rightly make much sense to me until I had sat in this dirty closet for a few years, and then I got it. The Dragon's Den.'' the voice sobbed a laugh. The dim hallways echoed the sob, bouncing off the cold, dirty concrete walls. And echo made the sob sound more like a scream, until it finally drifted off. 
 
 `` We were his golden horde, you see, and he would defend us at all costs. And dragons loved secrets more than gold. You know what that secret that he defends so fiercely? I bet you're starting to guess,'' the voice asked. It was n't a question. 
 
 I was. Dread spread like black ice down my veins. My heart quickened it's frantic pulse, almost like it had a voice of its own. No. No. No. No. No. 
 
 `` We were n't insane. None of us were.'' the voice affirmed. 
 
 `` The cell next to me used to have a man named Franklin James. He was a construction worker. The *Man* had collected him after paying for a renovation in one of the blocs. Threw him in one of these cells. He passed away a decade ago, did Franklin. Was never as tough as the walls he built. I should know, I heard him trying to dig through them every night.'' The voice choked out another laugh. 
 
 `` Next to him was a woman by the name of Sarah Smith. She used to make pastries. Muffins. Croissants. Soft, fluffy things full of flavor. Ca n't say there's much left in the Den that is soft anymore. Those get weeded out fairly quickly, like Sarah did. She did n't last half a year through the electric shocks the Man so loved to give, to correct our *madness*. Our madness. Right.'' 
 
 `` I've been here a long time, and the funny thing is, so have you.'' The voice paused. 
 
 `` We've had this discussion many times by now. Always the same, when you woke up. Always the disbelief. The exact same as the first day we talked. The first day you made me up to hide from the shocks. From the torture. The day you made up an older man by the name of Hill, a man who missed fresh grass and sunshine. A man who could live through the pain and take the misery for you.'' 
 
 Nothing moved. Silence settled over the small cell like the soft cloak of death. 
 
 `` Well, I'm tired.'' the voice said. My voice. It had always been my voice. My jaws ached from speaking. Why was I still speaking? 
 
 `` It's your turn now,'' the voice said. `` Maybe now I'll get to retreat inside of you, into a place without the darkness and the pain. Maybe now you'll get to take fifteen years of abuse with barely a soul to talk to. Or maybe you'll make someone new. You're good at that. In any case, it does n't matter to me anymore. I'm done. `` 
 
 `` Give the Man in the Coat my regards, sonny.'' the voice-I- said. 
 
 The voice retreated, leaving me alone in the padded cell. I frantically looked at my clothes. A few tattered scraps were all that was left of my old coat. The patch read `` Iza rld!'' held on by a few determined tatters. In the corner were a few scraps of cardboard and blanket. This could n't be real. This could n't be happening. 
 
 The metal grate on the thick door shrieked open. The only thing I could see on the other side was a mouth full of broken, yellow teeth surrounded by cracked, wrinkled lips. A mouth befitting a demon. I could almost see the smoke wisp out of those lips as a long longue lashed over those teeth, anticipating the moment. 
 
 `` Hello, Franklin Hill.'' The Man croaked. 
 
 `` Ready for today's treatment?'' 
 
 
 
 I started screaming.

I had been so close to freedom, so close to a future filled with promise, and then this idiot, this broken soul, had ripped it all away from me. My dream of college, my dreams of a better life, all shattered in the blink of an eye.

The worn voice of a man, as brittle as a dried leaf, filled the cell. It was a voice full of regret and despair, a voice that carried the weight of a shattered dream and the promise of a life forever lost.

I pleaded with him, but my words fell on deaf ears. He claimed there was no mixup, no error, and that I was stuck in the Dragon's Den for the foreseeable future. I felt as if the world was spinning out of control, and I was helpless to stop it.

 The VP gazes, condescendingly, out of the 32nd floor window at the hordes of ingrates who will not finish their TP16's tonight. He turns to his computer and roars `` To defeat my enemies, to drive them before me, and to hear the lamentations of their women.'' And it's on. 
 
 Form after form is torn from inboxes, processed, signed, and processed. By the time Freya has crossed the moon, VP has emptied the room of paper. It is time for ale.

His eyes, as keen as a hawk's, scanned the landscape below, anticipating the battle that lay ahead.

With the grace of a seasoned warrior, he scoured the digital battlefield, tearing form after form from their virtual chains. As Freya crossed the celestial river, her weary steps echoed the journey of the knights of old, and the VP, consumed by his work, had emptied the office of its paper burdens.

With the battle won, and the day fading, the knight felt an urge for libation. He ascended to the bar, his mighty beard flowing behind him, and ordered the largest beer that the tavern could offer. As he quaffed his ale, a song erupted from the depths of his soul, a melody as potent as any knight's battle cry. The office erupted into a frenzy of laughter and cheers, their voices echoing through the night.

Yet, amidst the revelry, a somber thought lingered in the knight's heart. His own sons, once innocent and full of promise, awaited the fruits of Accounts Receivable at home, bitter and unblooded from a week at school.

 “ It ’ s okay, baby. Just go back to your room. I ’ ll be up in a minute. ” I watched her turn around and go back before I resumed boarding up the front door. They were everywhere now.

I have to protect this house. They ’ re coming up the driveway. Leave. LEAVE. They stopped to look at the rosebush I have out front. I ready another board. They judge my color-scheme.

As I sit amidst the remnants of a once tranquil evening, the insidious echoes of hate-speak reverberate through my ears, leaving me with a profound sense of unease.

The plight of my daughter, a beacon of innocence amidst the storm, consumes my thoughts. Her fear, palpable as the scent of lavender on a summer night, fills me with an unbearable longing to shield her from the dangers that loom large. The world seems to be crumbling around us, and I am powerless to protect her from the impending storm.

I hear the board cracking beneath my hammering hand, a testament to my desperation. My thumb, a casualty in this battle, bleeds freely, yet I do not falter. I must protect this house, my sanctuary, from these marauders. I nail another board to the doorframe, my strength waning but my resolve unwavering.

"I'd served my time. My Emperor. Hanging up my helmet had been the hardest thing I'd ever done, and I had fought on a dozen systems between Alderaan and Hoth. 
 
 That was three years ago. 
 
 There's not much choice for a former-soldier-of-the-empire. Many veterans settled down on a little backwater rock, peddling protection schemes for some fat Hutt. You did n't hear from them much. They lost themselves in a bottle of fire-water, losing their edge until finally they went to collect an easy debt and found themselves with a clean hole punched through their gut. 
 
 I wanted something more. Maybe not a big dream. Definitely not the same kind of pay. But something much more important. I wanted a family. 
 
 I used to be a sergeant, back when I had a squad on Tatooine. Now I was a father to a little boy and girl. The similarities outweighed the differences. My wife, Kessa, was the rock. She dealt with the tantrums, the screams and nightmares; from both the children and myself. 
 
 I'd crashed out. Failed a routine psych-eval. I did n't know why and the autodocs could n't fix whatever it was that had broken. A broken fighter. A broken father. 
 
 Kessa had found me, crying into a towel, leaving the kids to run wild in the dim apartment. She sat beside me. Took my hands away from my face. And kissed me. 
 
 `` There's nothing you can not do,'' she whispered into my ear. 
 
 `` It happened again.'' My composure was shot, but she took my hand. `` I was buying a new astromech. I wanted it to be a surprise. And the sales rep, he points to an R2 unit and I...'' 
 
 I broke down again. 
 
 `` Shh, shh,'' Kessa purred. `` I know.'' 
 
 `` I could n't bring myself to say anything. I just stared at them and I... I started screaming.''
"," Present the essay in the style of existentialist philosophy, questioning the nature of existence, freedom, and choice.","The essence of existence, the enigma of freedom, and the burden of choice are themes that echo through the existentialist tapestry of human experience. In this narrative, the protagonist grapples with the existential anxieties that stem from the realization of his shattered dreams, the burden of his fractured identity, and the responsibility that accompanies the freedom to choose.

The soldier's retreat into obscurity, his surrender to the oblivion of backwater rocks, exemplifies the existentialist concept of the void. In this barren landscape, the individual is devoid of the comforting illusions of purpose and meaning. The loss of the soldier's former identity, his squad, and his purpose in the Empire highlights the existentialist notion of the temporality of existence.

Yet, amidst the bleakness, the soldier finds solace in family and the pursuit of a new dream. The arrival of children, the establishment of a bond with his wife, Kessa, and the desire to create a meaningful life symbolize the existentialist concept of self-actualization. The protagonist's struggles to find his footing as a father, his broken psyche, and his shattered dreams echo the existentialist anxieties about freedom and responsibility.

The protagonist's emotional breakdown, his inability to cope with the burden of his shattered identity and the overwhelming responsibility that accompanies freedom, represents the existentialist dilemma of choice. His despair and his inability to find solace in traditional coping mechanisms illustrate the precariousness of human existence and the existential burden of confronting the vastness of the void.

In the face of adversity, the protagonist's wife, Kessa, offers a beacon of support and understanding. Through her compassion, empathy, and unwavering presence, she helps him navigate the treacherous terrain of existential despair. Her words, ""There's nothing you can not do,"" encapsulate the existentialist ethos of resilience and the belief in human potential.

The protagonist's journey toward self-renewal, his struggle to overcome his brokenness and find meaning in his existence, represents the existentialist concept of transcendence. Through the power of choice and the support of his loved ones, he finds the strength to continue despite the challenges that lie ahead.

In conclusion, the narrative explores the existentialist themes of existence, freedom, and choice through a protagonist who grapples with the burden of his shattered dreams, the responsibility that accompanies freedom, and the existential anxieties that stem from the realization of his fractured identity. Through his journey, the protagonist demonstrates the interconnectedness of existence and the transformative power of self-actualization and resilience."
"I always reach for the bedpost after turning out the light. If I do n't do this, I walk *into* the bedpost, and smack my knee on the bottom or my arm on the top. That second or so, flailing in the dark until I find it, is like being untethered in a sea of darkness; some nights I overshoot and end up cursing and freshly bruised, some nights I find it with guided accuracy. 
 
 Tonight, it is n't there. I pause with one hand back toward the light-switch, and one out in front of me, wondering if I'm about to overshoot completely and walk smack into the wardrobe. I furrow my brow in annoyance, reminding myself for the millionth time to get a lamp. I walk forward another step, waving my arm carefully; *nothing's* there. 
 
 It's astonishing how quickly I've lost my bearings. It's not a large room. I backtrack for the wall and the light-switch, fully expecting to walk into the post now I've turned around… I take five steps and stop. It is n't possible to take five steps in this room without hitting *something*. 
 
 My eyes should have adjusted by now. It takes a while, which is why I do n't bother to wait, but even so… by now I should be able to make out the faint orange of the distant streetlight. I stand there, confused. Have I gone blind? I blink, twice, then lift my hand to my face. No, I can see, very faintly, a lighter shape. I turn around, which is a mistake, because I suddenly have no idea which way I'm facing; I was looking for the hallway, where the light from the router should be blinking its mellow but perceptible glow from the study doorway. Nothing, not a single variance in the darkness, unless I lift my hand to right in front of my eyes. 
 
 I obey a sudden instinct to stay low and small, and crouch, expecting my hands to find hardwood floor or wool rug. 
 
 Not hard-packed gravel and dirt, like a country lane. 
 
 Am I outside then? My mind churns, trying to explain how I got outside from my bedroom doorway. A fugue, a seizure, sleep-walking. Except, this is n't *my* outside. There are security lamps and a few streetlights and the two-thirds moon that had already been up when I finished my evening meal. 
 
 No, I'm not outside. I ca n't explain how I know, except there's no breeze on my face, no sensation of endlessness above me. I'm in a room with a hardpan floor and no light. The breath goes out of me as I realise there is no explanation for this. 
 
 I crawl forwards, slowly, constantly expecting to crash into something; a wall, a piece of furniture, maybe something industrial… I might not be outside, but this space is *big*, the stifling darkness notwithstanding. Nothing gleams or glints, nothing makes any noise, except my breathing which is fast and ragged. Just hearing it makes the fear worse. I stay on the ground, thankful that I wore my sweat pants and t-shirt to bed, and that I shuffled back into my sneakers just to walk back from the bathroom. 
 
 I crawl like this, my knees jabbed and numbed by loose flecks of gravel, my hands alternately reaching forwards and propelling me one stuttering lunge at a time into an unknowable darkness. 
 
 And then I feel something. My hand hits fabric, then something unyielding under it; I almost shriek, and yank my hand back to cover my mouth. Surprise, that's all. I wait until I'm sure I'm not going to have a heart attack, and then tentatively reach back out… fabric, yes, like rough linen or sacking. And under it… I moan, despite wanting to be as quiet as possible. Under the fabric, a leg. Next to it, another. Standing perfectly still, unvoiced. 
 
 Someone's there.

The wind whipped my hair around me, and the sand danced in my eyes. I was riding the wind, out on the Great Plains, and the only sound was the hum of my horse's hooves and the distant cry of a coyote.

But fate took a cruel hand and tossed me from my horse, leaving me sprawled on the sand. I looked around, dazed and confused. The desert stretched before me like an endless ocean, and the sky was vast and star-studded. I felt like I was in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but the wind and the desert for company.

I tried to get my bearings, but the desert was a cruel and unforgiving place. The sand shifted beneath me, and the wind blew sand in my eyes and mouth. I stumbled and stumbled, trying to find a landmark, but there was nothing. I felt like I was walking through a labyrinth of sand, and I was lost.

Finally, I stumbled upon a rock formation that looked like a giant arch. I climbed up and took a breath of relief. I was safe, for now. I looked around and took in the beauty of the desert. The sun was setting, and the sky was ablaze with color. I felt like I was in a dream, and I was grateful to be alive.

As the sun began to dip behind the mountains, I rode back to my camp. I was exhausted, but I was also happy. I had survived the desert, and I had come to appreciate the beauty of the wild."

""Gold for crossing?"" a voice inquires, but the fisherman's reply is met with a chuckle, ""Nah, I didn't come to cross, I came to fish."" A stark contrast to the war that rages around him. But as he casts his line into the river, the futility of his endeavor becomes apparent. The river yields no fish, only the echoes of war and the scent of destruction.

For years, the gentle hand of the gentleman has guided me through the treacherous terrain of life. His unwavering support has been the bedrock upon which I have built my existence. Without his presence, I am bereft of the wisdom and resilience that he has imparted. The path I tread is fraught with peril, and I am mindful of the dire consequences that may lie ahead.

However, my anger is not solely directed towards the gentleman's departure. It is also tinged with frustration and resentment. In all of his acts of benevolence, he has always prioritized his own well-being over my own. His motivations were far from pure, and I cannot help but feel betrayed by the realization that I have been manipulated for his own gain.

 I'm not what you would call an overachiever; I'm also not what you would call an achiever. I'm what you would call, especially if you were my parents, a burnout. 
 
 It's sad really actually, I had always been so gifted as a youngster. I remember being taken out of my second grade class during math time to get special lessons from some counselor lady and how my proud my parents had been when I told them. I was the best reader in the'blue' reading group, where blue translates roughly to'badass reading maverick'. 
 
 On top of all my academic success I was really well liked by my peers. I'm pretty sure I had been invited to every single kid ’ s birthday party who was my age and was always bringing the funnies. 
 
 Everything changed when middle school started. On top of being a late bloomer, I had been molested when I was in kindergarten so when I finally did hit puberty the seeds the devil had planted really started to grow into an ugly cactus that soaked all the nutrients from my soul… But yeah shit happens I ’ m not trying to get all emo about it. Anyway yeah, middle school sucked. I had went from the cool talented kid everyone liked to the ‘ why the fuck are you so quiet and weird kid ’ that people tried to avoid, unless you were my old best friend then you would always be looking for me in order to torment me… oh yeah and my parents were one of those stay together for the kids type of couples and blah… okay I ’ m done with my sob story. 
 
 Anyway, fast forward 11 years and I ’ m twenty four with no friends, no job and no goals living in my now divorced mom ’ s basement. I had finally decided it was time to salvage what I could from my life and make something of myself and decided the first step was to stop waking up at noon and begin exercising. I made it my goal to maintain a schedule where I wake up at five in the morning and run a few miles; It was to be my first of what was hopefully one of many baby steps to rebuilding a proper existence. 
 
 It was harder than I thought. Eventually I lowered my goal as to just wake up at five in the morning since that seemed to be challenging enough. After a few months, I finally got my schedule aligned with my plan and decided to up the ante and start doing a little of that running stuff. 
 
 It was amazing, I had no idea that such a little change would have such a major impact on my general wellbeing. I was in a better mood, getting fit and even not being so damn neurotic in social situations. One night I even called up an old acquaintance-friend from high school and asked if he wanted to go to the bars of something. From his inability to talk on the phone, it seemed he was in succumbing to a similar lifestyle as I had been. Anyway, we went to the bars and we talked about video games, TV shows and other typical loser stuff; but that ’ s not the point of this paragraph. The point is that we were out till midnight, and when my alarm went off at five in the morning I felt that I had earned a well-deserved day off so I told my alarm clock to fuck itself…. 
 
 That night I had a wet dream where I raped a dog… Like semen came out of my dick…. 
 
 I ’ m not a weird mother fucker like that, I promise. I feel like there is a paranoia out there that there are more sexual perv ’ s than we would like to admit solely evidenced by the vast amount of weird fetish porn on the net… but I ’ m being honest when I tell you I ’ m not one of those guys, my porn is solely the classic man and lady bang-bang-athon. Still, I had that dream, so what the fuck. 
 
 Anyway, through experienced I eventually realized that whenever I slept past 5 AM or woke up and went back to bed I ’ d have a fucked up sexual nightmare… I ’ ll leave out the details but it only went downhill from the dog thing… 
 
 So, this stuff was all sort of interesting in a way as I had been a pursuer of the ‘ psychedelic arts ’ so to speak as a lonely highschooler and eventually pegged the phenomenon down as my subconscious punishing me for not following my highest calling; or at least slightly higher than being a complete burning calling. 
 
 So I woke up at five in the morning and ran, and when I did this successfully for extended periods of time life really started to make sense. 
 
 But for some reason, I slipped once in awhile, and whenever I did I fell into this weird ‘ the universe is trying to kill me mindset. ’ Overtime however, I grew more consistent in my ability to follow through and avoid the nightmares that seemed to be pushing me in the direction I wanted to go. I felt blessed. 
 
 Then it started intensifying, like as I ran more I got better at running ( duh ), and if I didn ’ t run long enough then the nightmares would come the following night; it was an extremely scary position to be in to be completely honest, I felt like I was talking a tightrope everyday, a tight rope where I would fall onto the devils cock if I slipped. At one point, after having been waking up and running for a good hour plus every morning for two months, I fucked up and surrendered to the nightmares for a whole week straight, after which I began taking anti-depressant medication. 
 
 The meds made the nightmares stop even if I didn ’ t wake up properly; and for another week I slept in and went about my empty days just as I had before all this had started, except I wasn ’ t depressed anymore because of my med ’ s. It was a haunted yet bearable existence. I justified myself saying I was going to feel haunted either way, might as well do this one because it was, well, easier. 
 
 But it got worse. I felt like… well here ’ s a poem I wrote the last day while I was on my medication.. 
 
 *Here I am, a boy with nothing. 
 
 My object of security is slowing losing it ’ s stuffing. 
 
 Nowhere else to go, the devil knows I ’ m bluffing. 
 
 Somebody help me, I feel so disgusting. * 
 
 So yeah, I crawled out of that hole and got back on my routine… I started from the bottom… I ’ ve been doing that for the past three years now and my subconscious is continuing demanding more and more of me. I ’ m at the point now where I wake up 5, run till 7, do yoga until 8, lift weights until 9:30 and cool down with a swim until 10. 
 
 And my life is getting better every day.

"," Use the minimalist and reflective style of a Zen master, focusing on simplicity and insight.","In the tapestry of life, the threads of fate intertwine, revealing the impermanence of fortune and the transformative power of resilience. My journey commenced with a flicker of brilliance, a gift bestowed upon me in the guise of effortless reading and unwavering popularity. Yet, fate took a cruel turn, weaving the threads of adversity into my narrative.

Middle school, a crucible of hormonal turmoil and emotional vulnerability, cast a long shadow upon my spirit. The seeds of trauma sown in my kindergarten days blossomed, leaving me isolated and misunderstood. The vibrant tapestry of my former self, adorned with the hues of laughter and camaraderie, was torn apart, leaving only the remnants of memories.

Yet, amidst the darkness, a glimmer of hope emerged. I discovered the transformative power of physical exertion, a testament to the enduring spirit that lay dormant within me. Through the sweat and grit of exercise, I began to reclaim my strength, both physical and emotional.

From the depths of my mom's basement, I rose, a testament to the resilience of the human heart. The journey of redemption had begun, and I knew that, regardless of the obstacles that lay ahead, I would prevail."
"It was night-time in Noxdie City. The sky presented the artificial darkness that every citizen desired to traverse. It was too late to do so now; the atmosphere was no longer suitable for humans, and, as such, the World Ministry recreated it, back in 2044. Since then, the city has been evolving into a complex system. Perhaps this evolution had been affecting human beings as well. 
 
 `` It's been so long since I last saw real daylight,'' said Vanum, `` and even the artificial one. Since the Democratic Weather System took over Aeris 2.0, everyone has been voting for night-time, over and over. ``, she muttered. 
 
 She got up from bed and prepared to go to work. 
 
 `` Yet another day in this city of mirrors.''
"," Style the text as a Cold War espionage thriller, filled with intrigue, covert operations, and geopolitical tension.","The night cast long, ominous shadows across Noxdie City, a city bathed in artificial darkness. The grim atmosphere was the creation of the World Ministry, a tyrannical force that had usurped the planet in 2044. Since then, Noxdie had become a canvas of intrigue and espionage.

Vanum, a skilled operative, stared at the ceiling, her mind drifting to the distant memory of seeing real daylight. The artificial darkness, pervasive in the city, had cast a pall over its inhabitants, and she was one of the few who still remembered the days when the sky danced with stars.

As she rose from her bed, Vanum began preparing for her latest covert mission. Tonight, she was tasked with infiltrating the Ministry's headquarters, a daunting task given the agency's unwavering vigilance and the potential consequences of failure.

With meticulous planning and a daring spirit, Vanum slipped through the city's labyrinth of streets, her senses on high alert. She bypassed the intricate security systems, eluded watchful eyes, and made her way deep into the heart of the Ministry's command center.

In the heart of the control room, Vanum found the data she sought - a blueprint for the Ministry's latest weapon system. It was a revelation, a secret that could potentially shift the balance of power and give the resistance a chance to fight back against the tyrannical regime.

However, Vanum knew that her victory was short-lived. The Ministry was a formidable force, and her actions would not go unnoticed. As she slipped out of the headquarters and made her way back to the safety of the night, Vanum felt a sense of responsibility for the fate of her people.

The city of Noxdie stood as a testament to the enduring struggle between freedom and oppression. Through the eyes of Vanum, we glimpse the glimmer of hope amidst the darkness, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity."
"I sat nervously on the sofa in my living room, adjusting my tie absent mindedly. Looking down at the yellow and red pattern I began to question what on earth had possessed me to pick such an obnoxious tie. I must have been feeling quite confident when I dressed myself this morning. I could do with a bit of that confidence right now. I was having my one year evaluation with Mr. Mittens, who would be assessing my qualities as an Owner. For weeks now I had been carefully preparing answers for questions that I might be asked. How well do I think I perform as a snuggler? Do I know when to pet and when not to? How can I assure Mr. Mittens that the laser pointer incident was a regretful attempt at humor and will never be repeated again? But no matter how well I answer his questions, my fate truly resided in the document that lay on my lap. I had been tasked with writing a 150 page essay on why I deserved to continue being Mr. Mitten's caretaker. 
 
 
 Finally I heard a meow emerge from the next room, signifying that it was time for the meeting to adjourn. I entered the bedroom and saw that on the desk was a cardboard box laying on its side, with its opening facing me. Mr. Mittens was resting comfortably in the box and welcomed for me to take a seat. A cat from feline resources sat in the back corner watching me, swatting her tail. 
 
 
 “ Hello Mr. Mittens. You ’ re looking cute as ever, yes you are. ” I said with a forced sense of cheer. Mr. Mittens looked unimpressed as ever. His unblinking green eyes looked over my face with great disinterest before he turned his head to stare out the window. I carefully placed the thick stack of papers in front of him. 
 
 
 “ Here is my report, sir. I am confident that you ’ ll find everything order and be impressed with my thoroughness. On page 48 you will find all of the flattering portraits of you that I have taken with my iPhone. On page 56 I compiled a list of my favorite 100 qualities of yours, all in alphabetic order of course. ” Slowly Mr. Mittens turned his majestic head and stared deep into my eyes, holding my gaze with great intensity. Without breaking any eye contact he reached out his paw and pushed the report off the desk. 
 
 
 I closed my eyes and sighed in relief before letting a smile spread across my face. “ Thank you so much sir, you won ’ t regret this. I ’ ll try my best everyday to be the owner you deserve! I promise you my attention won ’ t wander and all the catnip in the world will be yours. I can assure you that... ” but Mr. Mittens just turned his face and looked at the wall. I was dismissed. 
 

", Convey emotions and actions with the exaggerated expressiveness of a silent movie star.,"(In the exaggerated voice of a silent movie star)

I sat with nervous energy on the sofa, like a lion tamer waiting for the lion to make its move. The tie I had carefully chosen, a vibrant yellow and red masterpiece, felt like a clown's costume on my back. But I had confidence, the confidence of a lion tamer who knew his roar could silence even the most ferocious beast. The meeting with Mr. Mittens was about to begin, and I was ready.

I nervously adjusted my tie, like a dancer perfecting their pose before the spotlight. The clock ticked, and I knew it was time. I entered the bedroom, and there, in the cardboard box, rested Mr. Mittens, his eyes closed, his head resting on a fluffy ball. He looked at me with disdain. As I presented my thick stack of papers, I felt my heart pounding in my chest, like a drummer preparing for his grand finale.

""Hello, Mr. Mittens,"" I said, my voice dripping with honeyed sweetness. ""You're looking as dapper as a silver screen idol, yes you are."" He blinked his eyes and stared at me with indifference. I placed the papers in front of him, like a gift from a king to his subject.

""Here is my report, sir,"" I said, my voice low and measured. ""I'm confident you'll find everything in order and be impressed with my thoroughness. On page forty-eight, you'll find all of the flattering portraits I have taken with my iPhone. And on page fifty-six, I've compiled a list of my favorite 100 qualities of yours, all in alphabetic order, of course."""
"`` Why ca n't you be a café maiden, like your older brother?'' 
 
 I found myself screaming at my daughter. She stood before me, bold as brass, right smack in the middle of our family business dressed as a magical girl. The one thing I promised her mother would never happen. 
 
 `` The world is in peril,'' she said. Stating the too obvious. 
 
 `` The world is always in peril!'' I said, `` When are you going to get it through your head there is always going to be a giant monster, or werewolves, or vampires, or some giant rampaging transgendered jabberwocky roaming the world somewhere, but it is not for you to save us from it.'' 
 
 `` I was chosen father!'' she said. 
 
 She raised a staff above her head and transformed right there, into her battle form, with the whole café watching. Magical girl outfits were always on the unmodest side but this outfit was deliberately pushing it to the extremes. It made it extremely obvious, Maaya was not a little girl anymore. Ever since she had grown much taller than me, her father, she had been getting increasingly rebellious. Looking up at this enchanted Titania reminded me of her mother, which was not helping with my mood. 
 
 `` Magical girls always lead to a bad end,'' I pleaded with her. 
 
 Then I pointed to my eldest son, Yukio, serving drinks at the far end, trying his best in vain to draw attention away from us. 
 
 `` Look at your brother! A handsomer man in a maid outfit you will never find, and proud of it! He'll be graduating from business college just a few years and I will hand over the café to you two and retire. I ca n't handle my children spending their lives fighting evil. Always in danger!'' 
 
 `` Mother was a magical girl, father!'' screamed Maaya, `` She protected us from danger. You have no idea what you're talking about.'' 
 
 That was the last straw. I pulled small baton from my maid apron showed this little upstart how one properly transforms into a magical girl. A bright sprinkling pink dress with the cat ears of a warrior I had not worn in over a decade. With panties, garters, and fishnets, not this g-string and tattoo nonsense they tarted around in these days. 
 
 Maaya was of course stunned. 
 
 `` You... you were Kamaya Catboy? The great defender of the city?'' 
 
 My baton transformed into a great staff which I thumped upon the floor to emphasize I was putting my foot down. Magical thunder shook the city with my might. 
 
 `` Now you know I do know what I'm talking about.'' 
 
 I gripped my staff with both hands as I fought to find the courage to retell the most painful memory of my life. 
 
 `` Your mother and I fought together to send Queen Athaliah, back to the netherworld, that battle cost your mother her life. As she lay dying in my arms I promised I would do everything I could to keep you and your brother safe. The both of you were just babies at the time. I had to raise you alone. I did everything I could to keep you two away from magical questing so you would not pick up your mother's curse. That's what it means to be a magical girl. You will fight until you die or you see you loved ones killed! You're too young to understand what it can cost you.'' 
 
 `` I understand that if you refuse to defend this city as Kamaya Catboy, someone has to take your place,'' said Maaya. 
 
 She pointed her staff at my own and fired a magical beam of lighting, causing me to drop it. Just like her mother, she was much more powerful than I, and far more stubborn. If she wanted to fight evil, I could n't stop her. In the distance there was another rumble. Some great Kaiju or some other damn thing was rising from the sea to have a bit of a snit at the city. Maaya took to the air, like an avenging angel. 
 
 `` I'm going, father,'' she said, `` Please do n't banish me from home for disobeying you.'' 
 
 I could n't stop myself from crying. 
 
 `` No. Your mother would never forgive me.'' 
 
 As Maaya flew off I picked up my staff. Something I swore to never pick up again. As I watched Maaya fly into battle through teary eyes, my son Yukio approached me. It was obvious he knew the whole time his younger sister was a magical girl. 
 
 `` I do n't suppose you have some great secret to share with me?'' I asked, stupidly. 
 
 Yukio transformed into a black mage. At least the outfit was tasteful, especially compared to his sister. 
 
 `` She can use a little help, she's a beginner you know,'' he said. 
 
 He had a point. Together we took to the air like a team of superheroes, defending the city. If I could not keep my children from danger, the least I could do was train them at my best to gain victory. 

"," Use the eloquent and witty language of an Elizabethan playwright, full of double entendres.","""Why can't you be a café maiden, like your older brother?"" I roared, my voice dripping with honeyed venom.

My daughter, Maaya, stood tall, her defiance as bold as brass. Outfitted in her gaudy magical girl attire, she had transformed our family business into her own personal stage. One thing I had promised her mother would never happen.

""The world is in peril,"" Maaya declared, her voice dripping like honey. ""It always is!""

I snorted. ""The world is always in peril! When are you going to get it through your head that there's always going to be a giant monster, or werewolves, or vampires, or some giant rampaging transgendered jabberwocky roaming the world somewhere, but it is not for you to save us from it.""

""I was chosen father!"" Maaya argued, her voice dripping like honey. She raised her staff, transforming into her battle form, the whole café watching. Her magical girl outfit, though modest, was pushed to the extremes, making it obvious that Maaya was no longer a little girl. Ever since she had grown much taller than me, her father, she had been getting increasingly rebellious. Looking up at this enchanted Titania reminded me of her mother, which was not helping with my mood.

""Magical girls always lead to a bad end,"" I pleaded, my voice dripping like honey. ""Look at your brother!"" I pointed to my eldest son, Yukio, serving drinks at the far end, trying his best in vain to draw attention away from us. ""He's a handsomer man in a maid outfit you will never find, and proud of it. He'll be graduating from business college just a few years and I will hand over the café to you two and retire. I can't handle my children spending their lives fighting evil. Always in danger!""

Maaya's defiance faltered. ""Mother was a magical girl, father! She protected us from danger. You have no idea what you're talking about.""

That was the last straw. I retrieved my trusty baton from my maid apron, the symbol of authority, and showed this little upstart how one properly transformed into a magical girl. A dress of vibrant pink, adorned with shimmering stars, fit Maaya like a glove. As she danced through the cafe, her magical aura illuminated the space, I couldn't help but feel a sense of resignation. This girl was headed for a world of trouble, but I had done all I could to prepare her."
"They stood there waiting in anticipation. Well, one of them was. 
 
 `` I should n't be in Hell! Surely this is wrong! God damn this place'' said the'bad' man 
 `` Well that was a mistake'' 
 `` Easier for you to say, you're going to Heaven for nothing'' 
 `` Actually I donated 95 % of my salary to charity which helped millions'' 
 `` Oh. That's probably why I'm going to Hell. I guess only the rich go to Heaven'' The other man pondered this. 
 
 At that moment a black portal opened and sucked him into Hell before the'good' man could retort. He turned to the other one who had n't spoke yet. 
 
 `` So where are you going?'' 
 `` I'm neither coming and going'' The'good' man was flabbergasted `` How do you mean? You must go somewhere. Heaven or Hell?'' 
 `` But I'm not a Christian.'' 
 `` Ah. Strange you're here then'' 
 `` Yep'' 
 
 A golden elevator came down and the'good' man stepped on it without saying goodbye. The last man was alone. 
 
 `` Now what?'' He thought to himself. Forever.
"," Use the slick and tough language of a 1920s gangster, full of moxie and danger.","The joint was buzzing, the air thick with the scent of cheap gin and desperation. Two mugs were waiting, their eyes glued to a portal in the sky. One was slicker than a double-barreled shotgun, an embodiment of pure evil. The other, a man of gentle contradictions, pondered his fate.

""I should n't be in Hell, surely this is wrong!"" the devilish one sneered, his voice dripping like honey on a fly. ""God damn this place.""

The good one snorted, ""Well, that was a mistake. Easier for you to say, you're going to Heaven for nothing.""

But the devil's smile faltered when he remembered his charitable deeds. ""Actually, I donated 95% of my salary to charity, which helped millions,"" he boasted, his voice dripping like honey on a fly. ""Oh. That's probably why I'm going to Hell. I guess only the rich go to Heaven.""

The other man stood silent, deep in thought. As the portal roared open, sucking the devilish man into its fiery embrace, the good one turned to him.

""So where are you going?"" he asked, his voice dripping like honey.

""I'm neither coming and going,"" the devilish man replied, his voice cold as a grave. ""But I'm not a Christian.""

The good one was flabbergasted. ""How do you mean? You must go somewhere. Heaven or Hell?""

The devilish man shrugged. ""Ah. Strange you're here then.""

The golden elevator descended, and the good man stepped onto it without a word. The devilish man was left alone, staring at the portal that had devoured his friend.

""Now what?"" he thought to himself, his voice dripping like honey on a fly. Forever."
"She begged me not to go. It was n't at all attractive of her. I should just leave her be, let her move on, but I'm a selfish bastard and she has great tits. 
 
 I jogged down the stairs and burst outside, finally letting out the air I had been holding. With the guilt twisting my breath, I told myself I would call her later, break it off for good. I had never made any promises, said any words that could be misconstrued, but I knew she felt a lot more than I did. I could never feel like that about someone else, but she did n't know that. Assuring myself, patting myself on the back, I strolled down the sidewalk, my spirits much higher now that I had decided to do the right thing. I had promised myself this before, but it was different now. I could n't breathe around her anymore. 
 
 I hummed as I went along, trying to get rid of the bad mood I was in. It always helped. My song had always made me feel better, stronger, more confident. It was all mine. I had never heard my song before, no one I had ever asked had heard it. When I was a egotistical teenager, not that I'm not an egotistical adult, I considered myself akin to Beethoven. I imagined I knew how he had felt with such genius running through him. I just had the one song, however, so I had to give that notion up as I got older and could n't do more than play Chopsticks on the piano. And not very well, at that. 
 
 My mood lifted, I looked upwards, smiling at the sun. I kept along my path and nodded at the people I made accidental eye contact with, returning a few nervous smiles. I'm telling you all of this so I can get to this one moment. The minute, no second, that everything finally made sense. 
 
 I saw the man up ahead. He looked cheerful, and I could tell he was whistling as he meandered along. He was an older guy, unassuming and average looking. As we neared each other I had already gotten distracted by a sundress, but when I heard his tune, I whipped around. He was whistling my song. 
 
 I stood there for a second, unsure if I had even heard right. I followed after him, getting close enough to hear his whistle again. It was the one. This was crazy. So, I was n't as unique as I thought. I knew it. My mother had said it enough. I had to ask him, of course. 
 
 I tapped his shoulder, and he turned, mid-whistle. He smiled at me, and I thought I saw something familiar, but it was fleeting. 
 
 `` This is strange, I'm sorry, but what is that song you're whistling there?'' I asked him, almost afraid he would dismiss me. 
 
 He grinned wider, `` It's a ditty I made up a long time ago, just something that came to me one day when I was holding my first kid. Why'd ya ask? Ya like it? My wife's always saying I should write some of my noise down, but that would n't make it fun anymore''. 
 
 Maybe I had went to kindergarten with his firstborn, or had some interaction when I was too young to really remember, and the child had repeated it and it left an impression or something. I needed to find out. 
 
 `` Where did your kid go to preschool? Again, sorry, but this is blowing my mind and the coincidence of actually hearing you, and.....'' 
 
 I trailed off. His smile was gone, his face pale. I could see the lines that aged him much clearer, and he looked a lot older than he had before. 
 
 He swallowed hard and I felt like I had just kicked a hundred puppies. 
 
 `` My boy, my first son, my namesake, was taken from us. He went with his momma to the fair when he was no more than 3, and she turned to pay for cotton candy and never saw him again. Damn near tore us apart. I'm sorry, son. Did n't want to get all heavy here, but I do n't know what to do about your music. Maybe we've crossed paths, I'm always whistling, always trying to raise my own spirits, trying to forget the bad past.'' 
 
 His eyes shone with the tears he did n't want to shed in front of a stranger. He hung his head as the last sentence was said, and he turned to walk away. 
 
 I remembered a fair. Being at a fair when I was young, and not being with my mom. I had asked her before about the lady I remembered being with, the red haired one, but mom just said I must have seen it in a movie and was just making up stuff like I did when I was little. I had a lot of stories I liked to tell as a kid. An overactive imagination, mom said. She would get real mad when I would tell one of my stories. She hated them. My head was fucking spinning, and I had a moment of beautiful clarity. 
 
 `` Wait! ``, I almost fell as I ran, again, to catch up. 
 
 I had to tell him about my memory. And, that I was adopted.
"," Recast the narrative in the style of an Arthurian legend, complete with knights, chivalry, and quests for honor.","In the realm of myth and legend, Arthur's tale unfolds, where noble knights and damsels in distress dance through the pages of time. A tale spun from the whispers of the past, imbued with honor, chivalry, and the quest for a noble purpose.

In this timeless narrative, a young knight named Gareth emerged from the depths of a troubled past, his heart burdened by a broken promise and a love he couldn't fathom. As he jogged down the stairs, he burst into the sunlight, his spirit ascending like a hawk soaring through the sky. With a mixture of guilt and determination, Gareth knew he had to break free from the chains that bound him.

He hummed a melody, his voice echoing through the streets, a testament to his inner strength and resilience. It was a song steeped in sorrow yet laced with hints of hope, a reflection of his troubled soul and his aspiration for redemption. As he sang, his worries danced away, and his mood shifted, mirroring the vibrant hues of the sun.

Suddenly, fate intervened, and Gareth encountered a weary traveler, his heart filled with the melody of his song. The traveler, an unassuming knight named Merlin, recognized the tune and began whistling it with vigor. In that moment, time stood still, and the world danced in harmony.

The bond forged between Gareth and Merlin transcended the boundaries of time and circumstance. As they shared stories and forged a path together, they discovered that their journey was intertwined with the destiny of the Arthurian legend.

Through their courage, determination, and unwavering spirit, Gareth and Merlin embarked on a quest to honor the legacy of King Arthur. They fought side by side, their valor and resilience serving as an inspiration to all who crossed their path.

In the end, the legend of Gareth and Merlin lives on, reminding us that even amidst the darkest of times, the spirit of honor and compassion can prevail. It is a tale woven with threads of love, loss, and redemption, a testament to the enduring power of music, friendship, and the unwavering pursuit of a noble purpose."
"“ Hey, sleepy head! ” The voice whispered. The voice was soft, full of warmth, and unmistakable. The voice of a woman. “ Wake up, boy. It ’ s your turn to make breakfast this time! You promised. ” 
 
 There was an air of familiarity with that voice. I felt awake, but my eyes remained shut. I began to feel the slow movement of her fingers walk along my chest. A smile slowly formed across my face as I struggled to open my eyes, but they just could not open. However, that touch -- -- that voice? It was significant. It was unique. Unmistakable. I knew this person. Then I felt her hair drape along my torso, her fingers continued along to the center of my chest. They stopped, and then I felt one finger begin to trace a path to the left side of my chest. She was tracing my tattoo. 
 
 Donna. The only woman who would do that. 
 
 I was able to groggily get my voice to work. “ In a minute…or ten. ” Still keeping my grin across my face. 
 
 “ How about— “ My mind began to race, “ now! ” 
 
 I felt a hand gently claw at the right side of my chest and begin to put pressure on it. She was tickling me. My eyes snapped open, while I instantaneously grabbed hold of both her arms. I was slightly blinded by the sunlight shining through the bedroom window, but I could finally match the face to voice. 
 
 Donna. The only woman who was brighter than the sun. 
 
 Her deep brown eyes gazed into my blue eyes. It was electric, I felt like the hairs on my body were going to stand up. My soul stirred as we continued to lock eyes. Her long, beautiful black hair draped down from her head, touching my cheeks. She started to slowly lean down to my face, her hands undoing her black bra. I leaned upwards to meet her lips -- - 
 
 BANG! An extremely bright flash of light. 
 
 A gunshot. A false awakening. 
 
 This isn ’ t where the story starts. That was a distant memory of what my life used to be like. Donna had vanished a couple months ago. A mysterious disappearance that rocked the small northern Virginia town we lived in. 
 
 Another gunshot. Another flash of blinding light. 
 
 I haven ’ t slept the same since that very day. My memory has been getting hazier and the number of hours I normally sleep for, has been gradually decreasing over time. Fuck, I can ’ t even remember how many hours I slept last night. Did I even go to sleep? Is that question even relevant? No. 
 
 My eyes opened a second time. I was sitting on the ground, my back laid up against a brick building. It was very dark out. Would've been almost pitch black, but there was a bright red and blue neon sign that flashed above me. I couldn ’ t read it, not because I wasn ’ t capable of reading; the sign was in a foreign language, made up of Asian characters. I looked back down and across from me into the darkness. I was in a small back alley, away from the main roads. I could hear the incessant beeping and honking from traffic nearby, a dog barking, a male voice yelling off in the distance, and muffled techno music coming from a shoddy apartment building nearby. 
 
 An overwhelming feeling began to dread over me. None of my surroundings were familiar to me. Where am I? This isn ’ t the Chinatown I ’ m familiar with back in DC. I know that I have a purpose for being here though. I have a goal. A mission. I remember being on a plane, that much is true. However, when was that? 
 
 My eyes were fixated on something else, however. 
 
 The body of a man lay face down ahead of me. A small river of blood flowing away from his body and making its way toward me. I dragged myself up onto my two feet and stood up. I walked over to the body and began to examine him. He was a lanky fellow, with black shoulder length hair. He was dressed in a dirty white t-shirt, bright blue jeans, and blue sneakers. He had three exit wounds in his back, a pistol still in his hand. 
 
 Another flashback. 
 
 I remember being ambushed after shortly getting out of a cab and walking through an alleyway. A bag was placed over my head and I was beaten unconscious. Next thing I know, I was strapped to a chair in a dimly lit room. I was in some apartment being held captive by some unknown hoods. They were casually speaking to each other. It clicked in my head that they were speaking Japanese. I ’ m in Japan, but where in Japan? How long ago was that? Nothing else was clicking for me. 
 
 Suddenly an overwhelming feeling of dread began to creep over me. Had I sleepwalked again? Did I have another one of those “ episodes ” again? I could feel a drop of sweat coursing down my forehead. I started to breathe heavily, and a sharp pain pulsed from my right shoulder. I looked over to my right and I could see my reflection in a dark window. My dark brown hair was a mess, I had a blackened right eye, and a small cut on the left side of my mouth. I had a grey t-shirt underneath a blue and grey flannel shirt, black jeans, and black/white Chuck Taylors. I looked at my right shoulder to see that there was a rip in the sleeve and a bloody gash. A bullet had grazed me, and it burned like hell. I looked down further and noticed that I was holding onto a pistol of my own. 
 
 It was empty. I went back over to the body and took the pistol from the dead man ’ s hand. I tossed mine into a bucket of dirty water and began to walk away towards the exit of the alleyway. A red and black 1984 Toyota AE86 hatchback sat at the exit. I reached into my back pocket and produced some keys, I guess it was mine. How I even got a hold of it, I don ’ t want to know. I opened up the door on the left side of the car, forgetting that Japanese cars are right-hand drive. I corrected the mistake and made my way over to the right door. I climbed inside and inserted the key into the ignition. My mind was going a thousand miles an hour, not even taking the time to even think about the dead body that had laid before me. I had deduced that I had another one of my sleepwalking “ episodes. ” I angrily punched the steering wheel, setting off the horn which, in turn, startled me. I looked around cautiously again, scanning my surroundings for any more vengeful hoods to show up and avenge their fallen comrade. With no one in sight, I pressed my left foot down onto the clutch pedal and turned the ignition. The car hummed to life, with the headlights rising out from the front. With my left foot still down on the clutch, my right foot on the brake, I disengaged the parking brake. I shifted into first gear, and began to make my escape. 
 
 I didn ’ t know where I was going, but I had an idea of where to go next. I managed to put quite a few city blocks between me and the scene of the crime. Suddenly, a pair of headlights began rapidly approaching from behind. I realized my ordeal was not over yet and downshifted into third gear, giving the old car a small boost of acceleration. My mission was going to have to wait. 
 
 For now.

"The intergalactic council was holding a meeting in Valhalla. Zorxban, leader, stood in front of the amassed individuals and called for silence. 
 
 `` Now as you all know, we are here today to deal with a urgent problem. Time travelling humans have attempted to disrupt the continuum using methods synonymous in their language with'ruckus'. Infiltrating Hitler's base, making a game of who can kill him in the most unique way. Making up bizarre scenarios with Bob Ross meeting Hitler and various others. Talk of time stopping, escaping Death, talking with Death. Immortality. Superpowers. The list goes on! But most importantly is they know of the existence of this council and it's whereabouts!'' Zorxban exclaimed. 
 
 Everyone in attendance gasped. A small man in the back of room with a nice suit piped up. 
 
 `` Well... if they're so dangerous why do n't we just obliterate them?'' The man questioned. 
 
 Zorxban pinched the bridge of his brow. Sighing, he began to explain. `` You see, Ted. We've tried. They're the most resilient race of beings we've ever come across. At least that was last week. Currently, they rank among the weakest in the galaxy. But their race is nothing but a wild card. Powers suddenly stemming from emotion, spontaneous genetic mutation, soulmates... it's all really nonsense. We enslave them only to have them rise up. They develop faster than light travel in mere months and beat us back into the depths of space. Then, inexplicably, it all collapses! And now that they know our whereabouts it's only a matter of time before they begin a conquest for a galactic empire!'' Zorxban finished, a hint of despair in his tone. 
 
 The council quietly chatted amongst each other, desperate for a plan. Quietly, Ted sat there pondering. It came to him slowly as he twirled his pen in his hands. He remembered a place. A place where he would waste time in his old accounting days. Ted spoke up. 
 
 `` AHA!'' The entire council snapped their attentions to him. 
 
 `` I've got it! You speak of a place Zorxban, a place I remember now. It is a place where humans write tomes and stories on a platform called the'internet.' It's a long shot but I believe we can predict when the humans will be weak next. If we follow the trends, we can predict there next move! We can make the galaxy safe from humans!'' Ted finished excitedly. 
 
 Zorxban lifted his heavy head from the table. `` Are you suggesting that stories are what give humans there power?! Mere imagination?'' Zorxban said incredulous. 
 
 Ted smiled wryly, `` Zorxban, I know better than anyone. The pen is always mightier than the sword.''

"," Present the essay in the style of existentialist philosophy, questioning the nature of existence, freedom, and choice.","In the cosmic tapestry of existence, where the threads of time intertwine with the enigmatic tapestry of human consciousness, the existentialist philosophy finds its footing. The enigmatic dance between freedom, choice, and the crushing weight of responsibility casts long shadows across the existentialist canvas.

As we ponder the nature of our being, the question of our existence emerges as an existentialist enigma. We grapple with the enigma of our purpose, the meaninglessness of our individual journeys, and the enigmatic interplay between freedom and determinism. The existentialist philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, eloquently articulated this existentialist dilemma, stating, ""existence precedes essence.""

Yet, within this labyrinth of uncertainty, we find solace in our capacity for freedom. Freedom, according to existentialist philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is ""the power to create meaning"" from within ourselves. It is the ability to choose our own path, to forge our own destiny, unconstrained by the dictates of others or the constraints of circumstance.

However, with freedom comes the weighty responsibility of making meaningful choices. The choices we make define our existence, shaping our relationships, our values, and our sense of self. As Sartre aptly stated, ""The meaning of life is to be responsible for oneself.""

In the face of the existentialist challenges, we must embrace our freedom and responsibility, recognizing that our choices are ultimately our own. We must dare to question, to explore, to create meaning and purpose in a universe that indifferent to our existence.

The existentialist journey is not devoid of its challenges. It requires courage, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to personal growth. It is a journey towards self-actualization, the realization of our full potential, and the creation of a meaningful existence amidst the enigma of time.

Therefore, let us embrace our existence, with all its complexities and contradictions. Let us celebrate our freedom, even as we acknowledge our responsibilities. Let us live authentically, with passion, purpose, and courage, knowing that we are all authors of our own stories, architects of our own destinies."

 Dear Mr. Duck, 
 
 In connection with the transaction enclosed on January 13, 2020, I have enclosed the following original equity certificates.

 Please acknowledge receipt of the forgoing by signing and dating the acknowledgement on the back of this letter and faxing it to me at the number displayed on the enclosed business card or emailing it to me at MGaston @ Beastfinancecorp.com.

 From: DDuck @ McDuckCapitalBank.com 
 To: MGaston @ Beastfinancecorp.com 
 
 Subject: Receipt of notes 
 
 
 
 Gaston, 
 
 We have received the package containing your firm's equity investment and will secure it in our vault this afternoon. I have sent a scan of the acknowledgment on the back of your letter to your facsimile as requested. 
 
 Best, 
 DD 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 
 
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, the document processing vault at McDuck Capital Bank received several dozen certificates similar to the above in connection to the Mickey Mars transaction. As Qualified Document Custodians under the Dodd Frank Act, McDuck Bank received a fee from its clients in exchange for securing certain investment documents within its vaults. The clients, in this case a syndicate of private equity investors working with King Arthur Capital ( formerly Credit Suisse ), sent these documents to McDuck Bank, US Bank, or any other qualified custodian of their choice in order to comply with Dodd Frank regulations. 
 
 
 McDuck had, as his reputation would have suggested, engineered his bank's position as a Qualified Document Custodian to his personal advantage. To begin with, he possessed a complete listing of all documents within the bank's vault which related to the Mickey Mars transaction on his personal computer under the guise of working from home. McDuck used this data to determine which of his bank's clients held the largest positions within Mickey Mars, and presented it a certain Mr. Chernabog. 
 
 
 Although the details of the meeting are forever unknown as Chernabog refuses to deliver testimony and Mr. McDuck's counsel has advised him to deny any recollection of the event, certain outcomes of the discussion between the two gentlemen have become clear: 
 
 
 Firstly, according to sources whom we will not name McDuck's personal account in the Cayman islands decreased by $ 1.7 bazillion. Although we can not be sure where he transferred the funds, the sum of all balances of Chernabog's accounts increased by a similar amount shortly thereafter. 
 Secondly, Chernabog used the vast majority of his increased funds, $ 1.5 bazillion, to short several LPs as a qualified investor, including Beast Finance Corporation whose equity transmittal letter I have reproduced above with the aid of my crystal ball. These LP corresponded exactly with the top entries on McDuck's list with maximum exposure to Mickey Mars. 
 
 
 Thirdly, Chernabog fired his broker and hired a new agent, Mr. Goofey, to manage his accounts. Goofey reports that he `` done goofed'' and transferred the shares to an account unknown to him. The position later appeared in an account linked to one of the trust funds responsible for Mr. McDuck's nephews' education. 
 Finally, upon receiving notification that Goofey had made the transfer, Chernabog flew into a fit of rage, or rather a fit of even more rage than he normally exhibits, and began attacking the spacecraft responsible for shuttling customers from Earth to Mickey Mars on the red planet. This behavior continued at random intervals for 3 months until the trust had liquidated its position. 
 
 I will let you draw your own conclusions. I believe I have made my own apparent. 
 
 I propose, as a member of this board, that Mr. McDuck be barred from purchasing shares in Mickey Mars. I recognize that my investigative methods have perhaps been unethical, specifically with respect to my reproduction of private documents proprietary to Beast Capital. However, I found them necessary in order to illustrate my point. I am prepared to launch further investigation if necessary in order to thwart any attempts by Mr. McDuck to obscure the channels through which he may attempt to purchase shares. I am also willing to transform into a dragon if necessary in order to more adequately defend out operations against further Chernabog attacks. 
 
 
 Accordingly, I submit this document as a motion.

", Use technical jargon and a sense of urgency typical of a cyber security expert.,"McDuck Capital Bank, located at 296 Bleeker St. in New York, NY, has been compromised, posing a significant threat to the security of valuable investment documents. The bank's document processing vault, responsible for storing certificates related to the Mickey Mars transaction, has been compromised, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive financial information.

The situation is urgent, and immediate action is required. The bank's security systems have been breached, and the perpetrators have gained access to a substantial number of certificates, potentially jeopardizing the integrity and confidentiality of the investors' holdings. The compromised documents include one thousand nine hundred and seventy-three (1,973) shares of common stock issued by Mickey Mars, LLC to Beast Finance Corp Fund II L.P., and three hundred and eighty-two (382) shares of preferred series A shares issued by Mickey Mars, LLC to Beast Finance Corp Fund II L.P.

The situation calls for a comprehensive security investigation to uncover the identity of the perpetrators and determine the scope of the damage. Additionally, immediate measures must be taken to secure the compromised documents and prevent further loss or exposure. Investors affected by this breach should be notified promptly and provided with guidance on how to protect their interests.

It is crucial to act swiftly and decisively in this matter. The security of valuable investment documents is paramount, and any delay in addressing this issue could result in severe consequences. Therefore, I urge you to take immediate action and work collaboratively with law enforcement authorities to bring this matter to a swift resolution."
"`` C'mon gang, let's investigate! There have to be some clues around here somewhere!'' 
 
 `` But Freeeddiiiiee, this place is so creeeeepy! Not to mention it clashes with my outfit...'' 
 
 `` Do n't worry Daphne, we're right on the Creeper's trail, I know it! Maybe we should split up and look for clues...'' 
 
 `` I'm not sure that's such a good idea, Fred.'' 
 
 `` Like, yeah, what if the C-C-C-Creeper shows up?!'' 
 
 *bark! bark! * 
 
 `` See, Scooby agrees with me!'' 
 
 I sat up, walking over to the door of the cell and looking through the bars as best I could. Maybe... maybe these children could help me? `` Pardon!'' I shouted, knocking on my door a few times for emphasis. `` Excuse me, children? Please, come here, I'm in need of your help!'' 
 
 The group that sauntered up to the door were... textbook, in a sense. Superiority Complex. Narcissism. Mild case of Autism, possible indicators of savant tendencies. Schizophrenia. Probably the only one in a relatively healthy mental state was the Great Dane, and even that assessment was mostly due to the fact that I'd never studied much animal psychology. 
 
 `` Zoinks! Like, what're you doing in there, Doc?!'' the lanky schizophrenic asked. I leaned in close to the bars, whispering. I did n't want to be heard after all. 
 
 `` I hate to break it to you, but I think there may be... a *madman* running around here, in a *mask and costume*! Please, let me out, I need to get the situation under control, there are some very dangerous people in this facility...'' 
 
 `` A creeper in a costume? I knew it!'' Fredrick exclaimed, and I gave him the least patronizing smile I could muster. Nodding, I pointed down the hall, explaining exactly where the keys were in the office. I went into a bit of detail about the man wandering around Arkham, dressed in a terrifying guise, using fear as a weapon. He fashioned himself a professional, but in all reality he was just a disturbed man preying on the weak. 
 
 `` Gosh, who woulda thought!'' the red-haired teen exclaimed, looking around nervously. `` Do you know where the flashlights are? I would n't want to get caught alone by someone like that!'' 
 
 `` I certainly do,'' I replied as the door swung open, stepping out and shaking Velma's hand vigorously. As I suspected, she grew visibly uncomfortable at the sudden physical contact. `` Let me get them for all of you. I'm very grateful for the help, but, erm... who exactly are you all...?'' 
 
 That was enough to let their self-proclaimed leader dominate the conversation for a few minutes, while I traced a familiar route to the western wing. Whenever he'd start losing steam, I'd simply ask another question about his constant exploits, or Velma's eidetic memory, or Scooby's intelligence. More than once the dog would yap and everyone in the group would turn to look at it. Perhaps they had some mass hallucination, because they'd act as though the brown mutt had said something profound or funny. 
 
 `` Say, Doc, where are we headed, anyway?'' Fred asked, looking around at the change in scenery. No cells here, just offices and laboratories with projects sitting half-finished on tables. 
 
 `` I need to fetch some things, Fredrick,'' I explained, finally finding the door I was looking for. Locked, of course. I started turning drawers upside down, looking for the keys. `` Chemicals, mostly, for taking care of the psychopath.'' 
 
 Finally, after tearing apart half the offices, I found the ring that had the all-important keys on it. Stalking back to the heavy bolted door, I started trying them one by one. 
 
 `` They wo n't... like... hurt him or anything, will they?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, we've got great ideas for some traps we can set up to catch --'' 
 
 `` No, and no.'' I replied, searching the shelves. Face cream. Joy buzzer. Green hat. Metal umbrella. 
 
 `` Jinkies... what is all this stuff? They do n't look like doctor's tools!'' 
 
 `` No, they're not.'' Toga. Bullwhip. Coin with a well-worn face. 
 
 `` Doc... uh, why do you keep your chemicals in here?'' 
 
 `` I do n't, Daphne, others do.'' Puppet with a tommy-gun. Giant rubber mallet. Top hat with a 10/6 size tag tucked into it. A-*ha*. I bent down, collecting my tools again at last. 
 
 *bark! bark! * 
 
 `` Answer Scooby, man, what kinda doctor are you?'' 
 
 `` Hmm?'' I pulled the piece of brown burlap over my face, fixing the filter over my nose and mouth. I fiddled a second with the gloves as I stood up, no taller but a much more imposing presence. `` I'' m a psychologist, sir, I study phobias. Johnathan Crane, at your service.'' 
 
 Giving it a test spray, I smiled behind the mask. Still in working order, with spare cartridges sitting right next to the gloves in the evidence room. The outfit would have to wait; I had research to conduct, after all. No shortage of subjects, either. 
 
 `` So tell me... do you know true fear?'' I stared at Freddie, the only one not backing away from me on instinct. Boy still had a little fight in him. I gave raised my hand, finger on the release mechanism for the gas. 
 
 ``... Would you like to?''

"She was n't much of a looker. One eye was kind of bigger than the other, so it bulged a little bit and looked like she was staring at you funny. Her nose was crooked too, but she used to tell me she'd done it herself by running into a chest of drawers. She did n't like the way it was before. Rose took up smoking when I was eleven and she was sixteen, because a boy in a leather jacket had pulled a lighter out of his pocket and slicked his hair back in a way which I would never learn how to do. 
 
 
 `` I do n't like it when you do that.'' I'd grumbled, feet hanging off the ground. 
 
 
 `` I do n't give a shit, sonny. I'm special.'' She drawled, and she was right. There it was, the little'X' on the back of her neck, standing out like someone had sharpied it onto her skin. She was meant for something great. 
 
 
 That evening, Rose and I sat in front of the TV. She stank like mint, overpoweringly strong. There was no mistaking her new habit, but I remember Dad letting it slide. She was meant for something special, something great. She could n't die yet. On the flickering screen, a man with black hair raised his hand over the small bible before a crowd hung in suspense. 
 
 *'' I do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United...'' * 
 
 When he turned his back to the camera the cross stood out against his white neck. 
 
 
 It was four am and the sound of buzzing woke me. I crept to the bathroom, floorboards creaking. 
 
 
 `` Go back to bed.'' 
 
 
 Rose was standing in front of the mirror, Dad's electric razor in her hand and long curls of blonde hair tailing over the corner of the sink. 
 
 
 `` What are you doing?'' 
 
 
 `` I want people to see,'' she hissed. `` I'm not like you!'' 
 
 
 `` You look stupid.'' 
 
 
 The floor had been cold under my feet, but it was nothing compared to the look in her eyes when she turned around to glare at me. 
 
 
 `` What would you know?'' She sneered. `` You're a nobody. You're not special. You will never amount to anything.'' 
 
 
 -- -- -- 
 The roads had been wet for about a week. I'd been watching raindrops chase each other down the smeared window of the beat-up old car. Rose got to sit in the front seat and Dad was struggling with a stick-shift, gears grinding and wheels sliding. 
 
 
 `` You excited about seeing Grandma?'' He asked, turning round and beaming at me. Rose's ears stuck out from her shaved head, patches of blonde fluff just starting to crop up again around her ears. Dad was going to make her wear a hat when we got there. 
 
 
 But we did n't. The wheels of the car skidded and Dad swore. The tiny car lurched and skidded, Rose wailing and gripping the dashboard with white knuckles as we hit the barrier of the road. 
 
 
 I do n't remember much. The water was cold and heavy and we started to sink immediately. Later they told me Dad's leg had got trapped under the gearstick. Rose had broken the passenger window with her elbow. She'd flayed the skin to her shoulder, they said. They did n't let me see her again for a while and when I did her hair was just beginning to get long, peeping over the corner of the white-collared shirt the hospital had given her. 
 
 
 She sat on the end of my bed and picked nervously at the scabs on her red, raw arm until they broke and soft red blood began flowing. 
 
 
 `` You saved me,'' I said nervously. The end of my sentence hung in the air between us. 
 
 
 `` I quit smoking.'' 
 
 
 `` You did?'' 
 
 
 She swept her hair aside and showed me the back of her neck, smooth and clear as if the cross had never been there. 
 
 
 `` Turns out you only get one great act.'' She said sadly. 
 
 
 `` One was enough.'' 
 
 She looked up. Cuts and bruises littered her face. She was n't much of a looker. But Rose was great. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

"," Embrace the dark, brooding atmosphere of a Gothic novelist, full of suspense and eerie beauty.","In the shadowy realm of Gothic literature, where whispers of the past echo through crumbling castles and sinister characters cast long shadows, Rose, a captivating protagonist, emerges from the depths of her troubled past. With her unconventional appearance—one eye bulging and crooked, her nose bearing the scars of self-harm—Rose exudes an aura of mystery and intrigue.

Growing up, Rose was a muse of contradictions. Her rebellious spirit burned bright, yet her vulnerability concealed a deep-seated longing for recognition. Her journey began at the tender age of eleven, when she ignited her passion for smoking, a habit that would define her rebellious nature and serve as a symbol of her defiance.

One fateful evening, as the flickering screen illuminated the room, Rose sat transfixed by the scene unfolding before her. It was a moment of high drama, a testament to her unwavering belief in her destiny. As the protagonist's hand raised a Bible and the cross pierced through the air, Rose felt a connection to the unfolding narrative.

The sound of buzzing awakened her in the early hours of the morning. The eerie sound of her father's electric razor echoed through the halls, but it was nothing compared to the piercing look in Rose's eyes. In that moment, she was consumed by her desire to be seen and admired, regardless of the consequences.

With a mixture of anger and disgust, I uttered my words, ""You look stupid."" But Rose's response was swift and unforgiving. ""What would you know?"" she sneered, her voice dripping with contempt. ""You're a nobody. You're not even capable of spelling the word 'special.'""

As I retreated into the shadows, the weight of her words bore down upon me. It was a moment of humiliation and regret. I had been a witness to her transformation, from a vulnerable young girl to a hardened rebel. And I couldn't help but wonder what the future held for her, a future filled with both beauty and danger."
"I ’ d chosen this stone as my home, so my scales could dance like stardust with the sun. 
 
 I also chose it because of the 4609, to remind myself of what I ’ d become. The train brought the wounds of my heart to life, you see. It was like pushing a searing knife to a scar. I could never grasp what I had done that day, but a useless lizard, once a man, deserved nothing less. 
 
 The first time I rode the train was with my father. We ’ d take a trip daily around the block. We ’ d sit in the back and blow raspberries at one another until the trainman kicked us off. My father was an idiot though. I mean he must have been? Because he kept his faith in me until the end. 
 
 I ruined his life, as expected, leaving him lonely and without friends. 
 
 Aunt Luce took me to the zoo one time. She packed a basket filled with her famous treats. I could imagine the flavour as I licked my lizard lips. And despite a watering mouth, any offer of something so scrumptious would be far too sweet. 
 
 I met my love, Cherry, at this same location. As an aspiring teacher, I commuted via train five times a week. We laughed, we loved, and spent years together. But in the end, I broke her heart. 
 
 I hadn ’ t expected her on the train that day. If I had, I probably wouldn ’ t have detonated the bomb. By the time we locked eyes it was far too late, and everything after that was gone. 
 
 Cherry flies above now, reincarnated as a beautiful black crow. I spoke to her last night when she flew down to my spot. I didn ’ t think she ’ d recognise me, but something about the after-life is a mixture of magic and a way the old world works. 
 
 We made a deal, a promise of sorts. 
 
 Any minute now... I hoped. 
 
 I watched as she speared away like a star from the pack. 
 
 And in a flash, I felt her beak pierce my heart.

"," Rewrite the text as an ancient myth, including gods, heroes, and mythical creatures, with a moral or explanation of natural phenomena.","In the beginning, there was only chaos. Then, the gods created the earth and the heavens. One of the most powerful gods, named Sol, created the first train, which was powered by the sun.

One day, a lizard named Lizard was riding the train. He was a very lonely lizard, and he was sad that he was not able to see the sun. Lizard decided to choose a stone as his home, so that he could dance with the sun like stardust.

The stone was chosen because of its similarity to the celestial tapestry. It had 4609 grooves, which reminded Lizard of the number of stars in the sky. The train brought the wounds of Lizard's heart to life, and it was like pushing a searing knife to a scar. Lizard could never grasp what he had done that day, but he knew that he deserved nothing less.

One day, Lizard's aunt took him to the zoo. She packed a basket filled with her famous treats, and Lizard was tempted to eat them, but he knew that he should not.

Later, Lizard met his love, Cherry, on the train. They laughed, they loved, and spent years together, but in the end, Lizard broke her heart.

Lizard's story is a warning about the importance of taking responsibility for your actions. If you do something wrong, you must own up to it. If you don't, the consequences will be dire."
"There was a world before this. 
 
 A world where the sky was clear and not brown. 
 A world where there were towns and cities, and the buildings reached for the skies. 
 A world where you could eat and drink as you please without worry. 
 
 But more importantly, a world of **knowledge**. We could write, and play, and sing, and dance. It does not matter where you are, who you are, or what you are. 
 
 I may fall to it, but you can thrive on it: knowledge is what caused our downfall, and now you have the ability to stop that from happening again. 

"," Emulate Morrison's lyrical prose, exploring themes of identity, race, and humanity with depth and nuance.","The sky once danced with the hues of emerald and sapphire, a canvas splashed with vibrant streaks of gold and crimson. A symphony of memory reverberates, a testament to a world that once was, a world etched in the tapestry of our collective consciousness. The echoes of that era reverberate through the halls of time, reminding us of the vibrant tapestry of our shared humanity.

It was a world where the streets teemed with life, where cities reached for the sky, and where the rhythm of the heart danced harmoniously with the rhythm of the earth. It was a world imbued with the intoxicating elixir of knowledge - a world where pen and paper danced alongside song and dance, a world where the power of creation knew no bounds.

Yet, this idyllic canvas was marred by an insidious force - the insidious force of ignorance. This force, born of fear and suspicion, sought to divide and conquer, to erase the indelible imprint of our shared humanity. Yet, through the crucible of adversity, a beacon rose - knowledge.

Knowledge, the antidote to ignorance, offered the power to illuminate the darkest corners of the human psyche. It empowered us to question, to examine, to understand. It was, and continues to be, the bedrock of progress, the bridge between our individual differences and our collective aspirations.

In the face of our contemporary challenges, knowledge remains a potent force for change. It is the catalyst for empathy, understanding, and compassion. It is the fuel that propels us forward, towards a future where we harness our collective wisdom to build a world where all voices are heard, and all hearts are embraced."
"In the distant land of South Africa, forces were stirring. The African National Conquerors, a guild of peasants that had heroically cut down a repressive monarchy and freed their people in the past. Yet in more recent times, people were taking up arms against THEM. There was Number One, Zuma the Shaman, who was very famous for charting a way forward for the land of South Africa by studying the smoke that forms when at least a thousand paper'Rands' were thrown onto a massive bonfire. 
 
 Their Bard, Gwede Mantashe, kept the spirits of the guild up and, within, came to be known as Mantashe the Musical. He relayed the visions seen by the Shaman Zuma to the rest of the guild, and always made sure there was a positive vibe in the ranks. There was also their ambassador Mbete, who always made sure that the guild got its way despite the opposition of rival guilds, the sculptor Mthethwa who made sure his masterpieces were always on display at the taverns even if it meant scourging unworthy competition, and who was previously the organiser of the guild's army. Under his leadership, they crushed a disgusting rebellion in a grand storm of arrows, but as his bloodlust grew, the shaman sought to bring out a more peaceful side by giving him a new role, albeit to little effect. 
 
 Recently, the guild of the ANC had been facing heavy opposition, most notably from the peasantry rallied behind a Bard known as Thuli Madonsela, given the title'Public Protector' from the villagers. The insolent wretches were demanding that money that was used to construct the Nkandla Palace, stolen from them originally by the guild, be returned to them. It was just Shaman Zuma, Bard Mantashe, Ambassador Mbete, Executioner Mthethwa, the swordsmen and crossbowmen under the warrior Nhleko numbering in the thousands, and the Spymaster Cwele against the rampaging horde of rebels... 
 

"," Use the authoritative and menacing language of a mafia boss, ruling with an iron fist.","In the South African land, a mighty guild named the African National Conquerors stood tall, their history etched in the annals of freedom. Yet, fate took a sinister turn as forces of oppression sought to undermine their reign. Among the rebels, there was a charismatic shaman named Zuma, whose visions guided the guild towards a brighter future.

With his powerful voice and unwavering spirit, Zuma's shamanistic prowess resonated with the warriors, propelling them forward. Their trusted warrior, Mantashe, a master of both music and battle, carried the burden of relaying Zuma's visions to the guild. Mbete, their ambassador, ensured that the guild's voice echoed through the corridors of power, while Mthethwa, a gifted sculptor and fierce warrior, defended their honor with his artistry and strength.

The guild faced fierce opposition from the peasantry, led by a rebellious Bard named Thuli Madonsela. But with the combined force of Zuma, Mantashe, Mbete, Mthethwa, and their loyal warriors, they crushed the rebellion. However, as bloodlust consumed Mthethwa, Zuma sought to temper his savage tendencies, assigning him a new role that yielded little effect.

In this epic tale, the African National Conquerors stood as a testament to the enduring spirit of freedom and the unwavering strength of those who fought for a brighter future. Their story serves as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, the human spirit can prevail."
"The sound came first, that's what I most remember about that strange day. A sort of scrapping sound, which heralded the arrival of a strange blue box. Then He burst out, looking ready to hike through the tundras that used to cover this part of the planet. I do n't know whether He was a time traveler, but the confused look on His face told us that He was not expecting to be greeted by a crowd of armed men in a wood at night. At that point, none of us knew that He would be our savior. He simply turned and called into His machine, `` Rose, time for another adventure.'' 
 And the rest is history...

The bewildering expression etched upon His visage belied the pivotal role He would assume in the ensuing narrative.

"I still remember how beautiful she looked on the day of our wedding. Her white dress with rhinestones shining in the morning sun as she walked. The contours of her body as an almost perfect hourglass filling out the dress almost as if it was a part of her skin. Her veil was lifted. Eyes the colour of chips of ice stared at me, piercing and taking control of my mind; stirring the exact same feelings as the day I first saw her. Her hair was a light brown with a natural wave that flowed to her breast so perfectly nobody would guess that it was natural. A smile appeared when she saw me that I shall remember for the rest of my time on this earth. 
 
 For our honeymoon we travelled across Asia and visited several monasteries. My favourite was on top of a mountain that took the better part of 4 hours to climb. The building itself was red brick, surrounded with gold statues of different deities ranging from 8 feet all the way up to 20 feet tall. The building itself seemed to touch the clouds, as if connected to something that we could never understand. 
 
 The monks that lived there often spoke of death, and how it is not wise to fear death; rather we should embrace it. I asked what happens when we die and I was given an incredibly simple answer; an answer that I fully understood, but could never fully comprehend. 
 
 `` Do you remember what it was like before you were born?'' 
 
 `` No.'' 
 
 `` That's what it's like when you're dead.'' 
 
 I always found comfort in that. Not a comfort as one would have when wanting reassurance that everything would be alight, but a comfort that in the end, the only thing that matters is what you have done with your time on this earth. 
 
 My wife never understood that. She was always overly terrified of death, in the same manner that a young child reacts when a bee flies near them. When cancer took her from me last week all I can remember was how scared she had been. She begged me never to leave her side and was constantly searching for alternative medications aside from the chemo. She was scared for the last few months of her life, and it took its toll on her. Some days I think being scared of dying was what really killed her, not the cancer.
"," Write as though you were a medieval peasant, with period-appropriate language and a focus on daily survival.","I recall the day when my beloved wife adorned herself in elegance. Her flowing white gown, adorned with glittering rhinestones, danced beneath the morning sun. The contours of her hourglass figure filled out the dress as if it were a second skin. With her veil lifted, her piercing blue eyes met mine, commanding my thoughts like a siren's song. The silken waves of her hair flowed down her back, as perfect as a cascade of golden honey. The smile that spread across her face when she saw me filled me with a profound sense of joy, a memory I cherish forever.

Our honeymoon carried us across the vast expanse of Asia, where we visited numerous monasteries. Among them, my favorite stood atop a towering mountain, accessible only by a grueling climb that consumed a significant portion of our time. The structure, crafted in reddish brick, resembled a celestial abode surrounded by statues of deities, ranging from eight to twenty feet in height. As if reaching the heavens, the monastery seemed to touch the clouds, connecting us to forces beyond comprehension.

The monks who resided within the monastery often spoke of death, teaching that it is not a cause for fear but rather a natural occurrence that we should embrace. I posed the question of what lies beyond the veil of death, and their answer resonated with me in a profound way.

""Do you recall the days before your existence?"" they asked.

""No,"" I replied.

""That is what it is like to be dead,"" they proclaimed.

I found solace in this simple truth. It offered me the perspective that the only thing that truly matters is the legacy we leave behind. My wife, however, struggled to find comfort in this philosophy. She was consumed by an irrational fear of death, much like a young child's aversion to a bee. When cancer claimed her from me last week, I witnessed her fear and desperation. She pleaded with me to never leave her side and tirelessly sought solace in searching for a way to defy the inevitable."

 Topluk hunched over the communicator and tapped frantically at the controls. Even encrypted as it was, sending the message over all available channels was a clear breach of protocol… but this was too big, too potentially disastrous to risk the message not getting through. His cerebral implants hummed softly as they synced with the device in front of him and uploaded both his warning and his memory logs. The lights in the tunnel dimmed slightly as the communicator opened a miniscule singularity and established a connection with the listening post a few light years away. One minute passed, then another. 
 
 He felt the chill of the voice before he heard it. 
 
 *Acknowledged. * 
 
 His implants went dead and Topluk tucked the device away. Swallowing the bile at the back of his throat, he walked back into the control room amid raucous hollering. One of the humans charged at him, teeth bared, and Topluk flinched instinctively. The human stopped short and wrapped its arms around him, uttering a barking laugh as it did so. “ We did it, Paul! We actually fucking did it! ” 
 
 Topluk bared his teeth in a smile. *Such repulsive creatures, * he thought as he shook the human ’ s hand. “ That we did. ” 
 
 The human turned his attention to a monitor nearby. “ Counter-clockwise circuit is almost complete. Had some fluctuations with the cryogenics a few minutes ago, but everything ’ s running great now. ” He turned back to Topluk, frowning. “ You feeling alright, Paul? You look a little green. ” 
 
 “ Fine, ” Topluk replied. “ Just more excitement than I ’ m used to. ” A familiar hum echoed in his mind. “ I ’ m gon na go grab a bite to eat, ” he said as he edged toward the door. 
 
 The human nodded. “ I ’ ll catch up in a few. ” 
 
 It was everything Topluk could do not to sprint down the hall. As soon as he found a secluded nook, he fished out the communicator and downloaded the message from Central command. 
 
 *Projections revised. Prognosis dire. Completion of project ahead of our predictions suggests underestimation of human ingenuity and perseverance. Immediate action required. * 
 
 As the plan filtered into his mind, Topluk nodded. It would buy them some time, at least. He just hoped it would be enough.

 The small crowd of physicists was silent, watching the monitors anxiously. Topluk stood with them, watched with them, but he was anxious for an entirely different reason. 
 
 “ Sectors one, six, and seven at nominal field strength. ” 
 
 The crowd murmured excitedly. Topluk felt a bead of sweat trace its way down his forehead, but ignored it. 
 
 “ Two and eight on their heels. ” 
 
 Time crawled to a halt. Five down, three to go. *Please, * Topluk thought. *Please. * 
 
 “ Sector five is up and running! ” 
 
 The murmuring intensified into a low buzz. A klaxon cut over them, and between pulses of the blaring horn Topluk heard disappointed groans. 
 
 “ Magnetic quench in sectors three and four. God *damnit. * ” 
 
 Topluk feigned disappointment as he fought to keep a grin from his face. Hands in his pockets, he strode from the control room and keyed the communicator. 
 
 *Sabotage successful. * 
 
 *Acknowledged, * came the reply. *With perseverance and ingenuity metrics revised, we estimate a minimum two month downtime. Stand by for further instructions. * 
 
 He sat back, resting his head against the wall. *Dangerous creatures, these humans. They breathe a poisonous gas, drink large quantities of a polar solvent, can sustain massive physical trauma and survive. They ’ ve spent most of their brief existence conquering each other and the planet they live on. If they learn the secrets of the universe, they'll do the same. *

His cerebral implants hum with power as he meticulously prepares to send a crucial message, bridging the vast distance to a distant listening post. The message, containing warnings and memories, is sent amidst risks and a sense of foreboding.

As the communicator establishes a connection, Topluk feels the disembodied voice of the recipient, a chilling prelude to the news that awaits him. The message is acknowledged, and the implants deactivate. A wave of relief washes over Topluk, but it is short-lived as his fears are confirmed. The human companion's ecstatic outburst reveals the successful completion of their objective, and Topluk's smile masks his unease.

The human's attention turns to the monitor, displaying the progress of the counter-clockwise circuit and the fluctuations experienced with the cryogenics. Topluk's concern for his well-being is evident as he expresses his discomfort. Despite the reassurance offered, he cannot shake the feeling that something sinister is amiss.

As Topluk prepares to leave, the human nods in agreement and promises to catch up later. The sound of his departing footsteps echoes through the halls, and Topluk cannot contain his urge to flee. In a moment of solitude, he downloads the message from Central Command, a relief and a confirmation of his suspicions.

The tale concludes with a sense of doom and foreboding, leaving the reader with a lingering feeling of uncertainty about Topluk's future and the potential consequences of his actions."
"John tried in vain to rub the sleep from his eyes as he downed the last bit of cold coffee. He had been driving for sixteen hours and he still had another ten to go. With a defeated sigh he began looking for signs for a hotel so he could rest before he drove off the road into a tree. He steered the car around a slow bend and half a mile up the road was a glowing hotel sign. Perfect. 
 
 John pulled the car into the empty parking lot of the large colonial style home that had been converted into a hotel. John did n't care what the place looked like as long as it had a bed and coffee in the morning. He grabbed his small suitcase out of the trunk and walked up the winding stone stairs to the front door. 
 
 `` Good evening sir,'' the concierge said as John stepped across the creaky wooden floor. 
 
 The small old man was wearing a worn, faded black suit with a small black bow tie. 
 
 `` Can I interest you in a room for the night?'' he asked. 
 
 `` That would be perfect,'' John said trying to suppress a yawn. 
 
 `` Excellent, right this way,'' the concierge drifted around the counter, where legs should have been there was nothing but air. 
 
 John could n't help but gasp. 
 
 `` Oh, yeah do n't worry about that, old war wound,'' the concierge said dismissively. 
 
 `` Uh, what was the name of this hotel again?'' John asked slowly backing away toward the door. 
 
 `` It's the Hotel California,'' the concierge said with a smile. 
 
 `` But... we're in Oklahoma,'' John said. 
 
 `` Oh, it's more of a brand thing, like the Ritz or Holiday Inn.'' 
 
 `` I'm going to pass, you have a wonderful evening,'' John said turning and ripping the door open. 
 
 He watched the hotel fade in the rear view mirror as he pressed the gas pedal down harder. 
 
 `` You know the words, it's too late,'' the concierge whispered into John's ear. 
 
 He yanked the steering wheel and sent the car directly into a tree, John's head smashed against the steering wheel knocking him unconscious. 
 
 John's eyes fluttered open, his head pounding. Soft linens were draped over his body. 
 
 `` What the hell?'' John asked looking around the room. A tray of steaming hot breakfast with a cup of coffee sat on the table next to him. 
 
 A soft knock on the door turned his head away from the breakfast, the small old concierge let himself into John's room, he glided across the floor to the bedside. 
 
 `` Welcome back John,'' he said with a small smile. 
 
 `` Well, this place has got ta be better than where I was going,'' John said. 
 
 `` And where was that?'' 
 
 `` Phoenix.''

"“ Say it. Out loud. ” I ’ m clutching my shopping bags to my chest as I scramble to rack my brain for answers. I don ’ t want to say the wrong thing, I mean this is Satan here, speaking of which I don ’ t know exactly how I ’ m aware of this, I ’ m just going off that sharp, chilling feeling up my spine and the heavy atmosphere you only feel when you read something by Poe in English class. It ’ s disorienting in the same way. You ’ re somewhere mundane, somewhere you frequent fairly often, but its not until you ’ re presented with these dark themes that the place seems surreal and you ’ re left existentially mortified by your own mortality. He laughs. Satan laughs, and it takes me aback a bit, considering he has such a jolly, hearty tone. 
 “ I ’ m fucking with you. ” I breathe a sigh of relief. 
 “ So I ’ m not ‘ interesting ’? Not peculiar in any way? ” 
 “ Oh, no, no you are. I was quoting Twilight back there. No, you ’ re still interesting. ” Shit. “ So you don ’ t know then? ” 
 “ I haven ’ t been made aware, no. ” I lower my bags slightly, adjusting to the situation, deciding that perhaps I ’ ve been holding my breath too long and biting the inside of my lip too hard. I ’ m lightheaded and I taste blood. “ Is it bad? ” 
 “ Oh, its terrible. Truly horrible. Ghastly, really. You don ’ t want to know. ” Is he messing with me again? I can ’ t tell, but that seems to be common with him. I mean, look at Eve, biting into the forbidden fruit. I ’ ve bitten in a similar way, chomping onto the bait he ’ s offering, desperate to find out what ’ s interesting about me, what ’ s peculiar, what ’ s wrong. But that ’ s just my nature, really. Satan grins in one of those malicious ways that says ‘ I ’ m going to drive you to your wit ’ s end before I reveal the answer ’. 
 “ Walk with me, talk with me. Come on. ” We begin to walk and I find it hard to keep up with his steady gait. “ What else did you need to pick up here? ” 
 “ …A suit? ” 
 “ Do you not own one? ” 
 “ I ’ ve grown out of it. I don ’ t go to many occasions. ” Satan snaps. 
 “ Bam. Suit. Looks sharp. ” I look down at myself and I ’ m head to toe in maroon and black fabric. Fits like a glove, or well, a suit. 
 “ …Not to punch a gift horse in the mouth… ” 
 “ But? ” 
 “ I need more of a funeral vibe. For a funeral. You know. A dead relative suit. ” 
 “ Oh, I see, I see, my condolences. ” 
 “ Its fine. ” 
 “ May I ask whom? ” 
 “ My aunt. ” 
 “ Were you two close? ” 
 “ …I guess. We saw each other often. ” 
 “ …But? ” 
 “ Well I mean, she was kind of a bitch. ” I wouldn ’ t admit it to anyone else, but I mean, its Satan, I ’ m sure he understands badmouthing a dead relative. 
 “ How so? ” 
 “ In every way imaginable. ” 
 “ And you ’ re attending her funeral because…? ” He tilts his head a bit as he looks at me. 
 “ I ’ m obligated to, aren ’ t I? It ’ d make me look bad if I didn ’ t. My mom would have a fit. Etc. ” 
 “ Ah. Always thinking about the well being of others, right? ” I groan. 
 “ You have no damn idea. ” 
 “ Which brings me to what I had mentioned before. You ’ re…pure. Like the virgin saint Mary. Near godly and what not. ” I stop in place to shoot him an incredulous look. “ Which also aids in you being a doormat, and not on of those nice ones, either. The ones with the scratchy material that people rub their shit-soiled shoes into so they don ’ t track it into the house. ” Well he ’ s not wrong about that bit. “ Tell me. You happy leading the life you do? ” 
 “ I ’ m about halfway between melancholy and miserable, so no, not particularly. ” 
 “ Tell you what. Keep the suit. I ’ ll make arrangements so that you can skip out on this funeral without ruffling anyone ’ s feathers. Now, you don ’ t have to swear to anything right now, but let me ease up your situation, help you live a little bit. Then we can discuss any benefits further, and the payment according. Consider this your free trial, alright? ” I get a free trial to see if I want to sell my soul to the Dark Lord Satan. An interesting offer for an ‘ interesting ’ individual such as myself. I ’ ve got this twisting, sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach, the feeling you get as a kid when you sneak a book of your dad ’ s matches to play with fire. I know I shouldn ’ t, I know the harm, but…The temptation here is unreal. Again, seems to be Satan ’ s MO. 
 “ …Why me? ” 
 “ Reaping the souls of the innocent is what I do. The more innocent, the more valuable, the more I ’ m willing to meet you halfway, if not more. ” His words make sense but I ’ m still left in a daze. “ I ’ ll give you six days of whatever the Hell you want. Pun fully intended. We ’ ll chat about details at a later date. ” He ’ s gone and I feel sick. I lug my bags to the food court, needing to sit down, needing a drink, maybe a ginger ale to settle my stomach. I pull a chair out to sit, and a large ginger ale appears in front of me. Nothing extravagant, nothing I ’ d sell my soul over, but highly convenient. I ’ m left wondering how I could go about these next six days. Do every drug imaginable without having to worry about dying or permanent damage? Enslave the people who have hurt me most? Kill a man? I find my mind going to very dark places, the product of being presented with such an opportunity. I ’ m deep in thought, sipping on a value size ginger ale in a suave suit in a mall on the sketchier side of town. I look out of place but it feels so right.

"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","The presence of the enigmatic and formidable figure of Satan evokes a disorienting sensation, similar to that experienced when reading the haunting poetry of Edgar Allan Poe. The atmosphere of dread and existential mortification permeates the air, leaving an indelible impression upon the unsuspecting soul. As I clutch my shopping bags to my chest, a myriad of thoughts flood my mind. I am acutely aware of the precariousness of human existence, and the unsettling feeling that the boundaries between the mundane and the extraordinary are often blurred when confronted with the darker aspects of humanity.

The laughter of Satan echoes through my mind, a testament to his playful and mischievous nature. It takes me aback a moment, but I breathe a sigh of relief upon realizing that he is jesting, albeit with a hint of malice. His tone is jolly and hearty, yet the underlying message is one of profound despair and existential angst. The juxtaposition of humor and tragedy is jarring and unsettling, as I grapple with my own mortality and the futility of trying to understand the enigmatic nature of existence.

As I lower my bags and adjust to the situation, I feel lightheaded and my taste buds burn with the acrid taste of blood. I am desperate for answers, for a glimmer of understanding amidst the chaos. Satan's grin widens, and I sense his mischievous intent. He is offering me a forbidden fruit, a promise of revelation and understanding, but I know I must resist. I am aware of the dangers of biting into the forbidden, the potential for destruction and torment.

With each step we take, I find it hard to keep up with Satan's steady gait. He leads me deeper into the abyss, promising enlightenment and yet leaving me with a sense of dread and hopelessness. The question of what is interesting or peculiar about me looms large in my mind, but I am unwilling to engage in the conversation. I am consumed by the feeling that I am being manipulated, my vulnerabilities exploited for his amusement.

As I walk alongside Satan, I cannot help but feel a sense of helplessness and despair. I am a pawn in his game, and I am resigned to the outcome. The shopping bags I once clutched become symbols of my worldly possessions, the remnants of a life that has been consumed by the darkness. I am a victim of the capricious and cruel hand of fate, and I am left to ponder the meaning of it all."
"I said I'd never use it again... 
 
 Three years ago I tossed it in an old tin lunchbox and buried it in the woods. It had rained the day before, so digging it up did n't take long. 
 
 It was n't plastic so far as I could tell. Too heavy to be plastic. Three and a quarter inches by two inches. Black as a shadow, it almost seemed to absorb the light around it. On the front was my name, a fourteen digit number and an expiration date in a gold embossed font. It expires at the end of the month. My hands trembled as I entered the information into the payment screen. `` Payment accepted.'' 
 
 That night I saw them. It was like stepping into someone else's nightmare. Some died alone. Others surrounded by their loved ones. There did n't seem to be a pattern or force behind it all. The only thing that they had in common was me. I did this to them, and part of me felt like they knew it. 
 
 ``... but where did you get the money?'' she asked. `` It's paid for! Leave it at that.'' I spat the words out, half panicked. I did n't have the heart to tell her. The operation cost one hundred and seventy three souls. One hundred and seventy three souls to keep my son alive. To keep our son alive.

 `` No I love you more'' she said 
 
 `` No I love you more'' he said 
 
 `` No I love you more'' she said 
 
 Ted rang the bell. 
 
 `` No I love you more'' he said 
 
 `` No I love you more'' she said 
 
 `` No I love you more'' he said 
 
 Ted rang the bell. 
 
 `` No I love you more'' she said 
 
 `` No I love you more'' he said 
 
 `` No I love you more'' she said 
 
 Ted rang the bell repeatedly. 
 
 `` No I love you more'' he said, speaking louder 
 
 `` No I love you more'' she said, also speaking louder 
 
 Ted picked up the bell and started slamming it into the desk. 
 
 `` Sorry I have to work'' she said 
 
 `` Finally'' said Ted 
 
 `` You hang up first'' he said 
 
 `` No you hang up first'' she said 
 
 `` Oh for fuck's sake'' 
 
 `` No you hang up first'' he said 
 
 `` I'm going in'' 
 
 Ted walked past the secretary and into the office of the 21 year old CEO of Life Indsutries. He was face timing his soul mate. 
 
 `` I love you the most'' said the CEO 
 
 `` No I love you the most'' said his soul mate 
 
 `` No I love you the most'' said the CEO 
 
 Ted stewed in silence. 
 
 `` No I love you the most'' said his soul mate 
 
 `` No I love you the most'' said the CEO 
 
 `` No I love you the most'' said his soul mate 
 
 `` Sorry babe, got ta go, I've got a customer'' 
 
 Ted's spirits rose. 
 
 `` You hang up first'' said his soul mate 
 
 And came crashing back down. 
 
 `` No you hang up first'' said the CEO 
 
 `` No you hang up first'' said his soul mate 
 
 `` No you hang up first'' said the CEO 
 
 `` Ok'' his soul mate hung up. 
 
 The CEO looked at his phone and laughed. 
 
 `` What a kidder'' he said, then to Ted `` What can I do for you'' 
 
 `` Hi, I got my manual for living a long and happy life'' 
 
 The FaceTime ring tone emanated from the phone. 
 
 `` No you hang up first'' said his soul mate 
 
 `` No you…'' 
 
 Ted leaned across the table, ended the call and held out the open book. 
 
 `` It just says give'er'' said Ted 
 
 `` Hm'' said the CEO, taking the book and leafing through page after page that had give'er written in big, bold letters in the middle `` This one does n't just say give'er'' 
 
 Ted took the book back and read the page. He let the his arms drop to his waist. 
 
 `` Yeah'' said Ted, turning the book to the CEO `` because instead it says'just give'er'' 
 
 `` Well have you tried it?'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Giving'er'' 
 
 `` No because I do n't know what that means'' 
 
 `` Well it means to…you know…give'er'' 
 
 `` Give her what?'' 
 
 `` No no no give'er…like give'er'' 
 
 `` You've just made it less clear'' 
 
 `` Well you know how you have n't been giving'er? Well now start giving'er'' 
 
 `` Stop fucking talking and give me another book'' 
 
 The phone started ringing again. The CEO reached for it but Ted got it first. He flung it across the room where it shattered against the wall. The CEO looked at the broken phone, then back to Ted. He pulled open a drawer and took out another phone, which he put on his desk. The CEO stared at it for a second, adjusted it a centimetre to the left then looked at Ted. 
 
 `` I'm afraid we ca n't'' 
 
 `` Why?'' 
 
 `` Every book is personalized. If we gave you a book someone would go without one'' 
 
 `` I'm going without one'' 
 
 The CEO furrowed his brow `` You have one though'' 
 
 `` A fucking useless one'' 
 
 `` I think it's solid advice'' 
 
 `` You think give'er is solid advice?'' 
 
 `` Yeah. Look at me, I'm 21 I'm a CEO, I've met my soul mate…'' 
 
 On cue the phone started ringing. Ted picked it up and tossed it over his head. It landed in the water pitcher by the door. 
 
 `` And if I could sum up what I did down to one word'' The CEO looked down nonchalantly, opened the drawer, took out another phone, put it on the desk and looked up at Ted `` That word would be give'er'' 
 
 `` That's two words'' 
 
 `` Is it?'' 
 
 `` Yes'' 
 
 `` Is it'' 
 
 `` What the fuck is wrong with you people'' 
 
 `` Nothing, because we followed our manuals, just like you should'' 
 
 `` But it just says give'er'' 
 
 `` Now you've got it'' 
 
 The phone buzzed. The CEO picked it up and held it to his ear. 
 
 `` Uh-huh?'' he turned the phone slightly, angling it away from his ear towards Ted so he could clearly see that the caller ID had identified the caller as'bae' `` Work stuff, I have to take it'' 
 
 Ted turned around, his book dangling from his finger tips, and walked out of the office, numb to everything. 
 
 `` No you hang up first'' said the CEO 
 
 Ted walked into the reception area. 
 
 `` No I love you more'' said the receptionist. 
 
 Ted walked by her desk. 
 
 `` Thank you for coming, No I love you more'' 
 
 Ted left the building and walked into the alley where a hobo was standing over a trash can fire. 
 
 `` Hello'' said the hobo 
 
 `` How are you homeless?'' 
 
 `` I have no house'' 
 
 `` No I mean, did n't you get a manual?'' 
 
 `` Sure did. Best advice I ever got'' 
 
 `` Really?'' 
 
 `` I could n't imagine being happier'' 
 
 Ted looked at him funny. A female hobo stuck her head out from their semi-detached cardboard and newspaper bungalow. 
 
 `` There she is'' said the hobo 
 
 `` There he is'' said the female hobo 
 
 `` There she is'' said the hobo 
 
 The hobo walked into the semi detached and started having loud sex with his hobo wife. Ted at the garbage can fire, holding his book, the sounds of hobo love making drowned out by the buzzing in his head. 
 
 The book teetered on the edge of his fingers and just before it fell he pulled it back. Ted sighed, looked over his shoulder at the rocking cardboard box and then went off to figure out how to give'er.
"," Adopt the exhilarating and descriptive style of a globetrotting adventurer, discovering new cultures.","In the realm of human interactions, Ted, a globetrotting adventurer, embarked upon an exhilarating journey, immersing himself in a captivating dance of love and conversation. As he entered the life office, his eyes met the vibrant 19-year-old secretary, whose heart was entangled with his soul. With each exchange of ""No I love you more,"" their love intertwined, a symphony of passion and emotion reverberated through the air.

The bell rang, a testament to their unwavering connection. As the words ""No I love you more"" danced from their lips, they indulged in a playful exchange, their voices echoing through the office. The bell rang again, but it was the sound of their hearts harmonizing, a melody of love and admiration.

Ted's persistence bore fruit, and the secretary's resolve began to waver. With repeated rings of the bell and passionate declarations, he drove her emotions to the brink of surrender. As he picked up the bell and started slamming it into the desk, a desperate attempt to convey his love, she uttered her frustration.

But Ted's spirits soared, and he seized the moment, his voice rising in a crescendo of passion. ""No I love you more"" he screamed, his words echoing through the office. The secretary's heart melted, and she reciprocated his love.

In a moment of respite, Ted walked past the secretary and entered the office of the 21-year-old CEO of Life Industries. As he joined the call, the CEO's voice intertwined with his soul mate's, creating a symphony of love and longing.

But fate took a cruel turn, and the connection between Ted and his soul mate was severed. As the call ended, the CEO smiled, his heart filled with joy and compassion. ""What a kidder,"" he exclaimed, his voice filled with delight.

Ted, the globetrotting adventurer, had traversed the boundaries of human connection, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of all those he encountered. His journey was a testament to the transformative power of love, laughter, and the ability to find joy in the midst of life's challenges."
"`` What the fuck do you mean why?'' She screamed as tears began to roll down her face. With each passing moment the look in her eyes became more and more desperate. 
 
 `` Yes. Why? This is the first time I've ever met you. How could you have anything against me?'' 
 
 `` The first time. Is it really that bad now? Do you not remember anything?'' She did her best to brush the tears from her eyes and clean up the dark black streaks streaming down her face. 
 
 `` Remember what? Who are you?'' I began to panic. Something was bubbling in me but I did my best to repress whatever it was and focus on this odd situation. 
 
 `` Remember us...'' She palely responded. `` Remember what we had before you started all of your shit. Remember everything we had before you decided that it was n't enough for you. Before you turned yourself into the walking zombie you are today.'' Her eyes were fixated on the lamp post behind me. 
 
 A memory popped into my mind. Maybe it was n't a memory. Maybe it was just some recreation my brain did to make sense of this crazy woman. It was of her. Her streaking blonde hair. Her beautiful blue eyes. Sitting across from me at a table. She's wearing a white blouse and is looking at me like... looking at me like... well like she loves me. Ha well that could n't be true. No one loves me. 
 
 `` Are you off in your head again? Is even seeing me too much to deal with?'' 
 
 A terrifying anger shot through me. `` Stop messing with me! I do n't know you. You're driving me crazy!'' 
 
 `` Driving you crazy?'' She began to sob again. `` Driving you crazy? You put me through years of torture. `` Us'' happened. Wake the fuck up. The last time I saw you you were begging for me back. Begging me to forget about all the pain you put me through. Finding the needles was bad enough. But the lying. The stealing. Leaving for days at a time. And now you do n't remember any of it? Goodbye.'' The second I heard the word needles a sharp pain tore at my left arm. I pulled up my sleeve and saw the scars. Memories of tourniquets and bathroom floors flooded my mind. Panicking I searched through my right pocket to confirm that I had the perfect medicine to make all of this craziness go away. As the beautiful lady walked away, I turned and made my escape back home.
"," Write with the cunning and secretive style of a Prohibition-era bootlegger, evading the law.","The dim glow of the streetlight cast long shadows upon the pavement, the night air thick with the scent of gin and desperation. Her eyes, as red as a devil's, burned through me, each moment etching itself into my memory. With a voice dripping like broken glass, she screamed, ""What the fuck do you mean why?""

As her tears flowed down her face, I felt an unsettling sensation, a sense of déjà vu. The look in her eyes mirrored the desperation I had seen countless times in the eyes of those crushed by the weight of their own misery. I tried to recall the details of our encounter, the promise of a future that had been shattered, but the memories were shrouded in a haze of alcohol and regret.

Suddenly, a memory resurfaced, a phantom memory of her vibrant blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. It was a memory as vivid as a dream, yet as elusive as smoke in the wind. I felt a wave of longing and self-pity wash over me. No one, I thought, deserved to experience the pain I had endured.

My anger boiled over, and I roared, ""Stop messing with me! I don't know you. You're driving me crazy!"" Her tears flowed freely once more, and I felt a surge of compassion for her broken spirit. In that moment, I was consumed by a desire to protect her, to shield her from the pain that had consumed her.

But as I reached out to comfort her, a sharp pain erupted on my arm, a sensation as intense as a needle piercing flesh. The pain, coupled with the look of terror in her eyes, drove me back into a defensive posture. I knew then that I was trapped in a cage of her own making, and I was powerless to help her."
"Jack flicked his lighter on and lit a cigarette. Smoke lazily filled the alleyway behind Close Encounter Clinic. 
 
 Right on schedule, Louis from Records opened the small, black door and joined Jack. 
 
 Jack sighed and gave Louis a cigarette. Louis nodded and made sure the door was closed. 
 
 `` You got anything for me?'' asked Jack. 
 
 Louis hesitated. 
 
 `` I think I know why they're doing it.'' 
 
 Jack raised an eyebrow. 
 
 Louis continued, `` Aliens.'' 
 
 Jack raised his other eyebrow. It was hard to control these things. 
 
 Louis did half of a double take, decided Jack was just being screwy as usual, and put out his cigarette just in case Jack had been spiking them. 
 
 `` Look, word is getting around that there is life out there. The government needs to be prepared. They're creating something. Maybe soldiers, maybe the next generation of humans.'' 
 
 Jack liked that word. Hu-man. 
 
 `` Why else would we be pumping them full of chemicals every day? I've looked at the records. Most people do n't pay. Some people have been coming daily for months. Does n't that seem strange to you?'' 
 
 Jack shrugged. He did n't really understand hu-mans anyway. 
 
 Louis looked at his cigarette and wished he had n't put it out. 
 
 `` All I'm saying is that there is something seriously weird going on. Plus, until recently, all this'what does n't kill you makes you stronger' was just songs and baseball coaches. Who would have thought that it was actually true?'' 
 
 `` What chemicals are they using?'' asked Jack. 
 
 `` That's the strangest thing,'' whispered Louis. `` They started out with things that could actually kill you. Cyanide, heroin - you know. They advertised it as a game to see who could survive the longest. Now? Calcium. It's weird. I swear I've seen some people in your division just pouring milk into the tubes.''

 Louis paused. 
 
 `` Come to think of it, your division is n't following the records. You're supposed to be putting pure iron in, now. Yes, I'm sure of it. Our records say that you should be switching to pure iron to'improve polarity' or something like that. 
 
 `` I'm sure it's just government bureaucracy,'' Jack replied. `` Although that iron stuff seems weird.'' 
 
 `` Anyway,'' said Louis, `` I need to get back.'' 
 
 Jack waved as Louis scanned himself back into the building. 
 
 Jack sent a brief message back to the mothership.

"Ulamog dragged his tentacled appendage along the pitiful ground of this new plane. All that he touched was turned to gray ash, the life sucked out of it. He was ever hungry, ever thirsting for more to consume. His unfathomable manifestation destroyed all that came into contact with it. Still he hungered. He had consumed world after world and still nothing could satiate him. This would be no different. 
 
 He could not stop. All he knew was to consume, to destroy. He paid no mind to the dying cries of the creatures he found on his way. His spawn skittered across the landscape, leaving nothing behind. As always, the world would be left bare and flat, with no one left to even know of it. It would be erased from existence. Then he would move to the next plane. Then the next. He would consume until no more was left in all the infinite multiverse. 
 
 Ulamog was the ceaseless hunger, the infinite gyre. In his wake, all was dust.

 Kozilek saw the world before him, seeing all time and space. He reformed the plane he saw, replacing the chaos underneath his feet with beautiful order. The strange, round, moving shapes became perfect squares. They became prisms and points. All that existed was his to make right. He ended the messy law of entropy. Gravity was replaced with the vision of all the universe. His slaves and spawn spread his fractal patterns across the ground. 
 
 He was a black hole, sucking the chaos out of the world. The mortal minds below him could not begin to understand what he was. Brilliant bismuth patterns replaced the streets he walked upon. The wretched little creatures below would be his servants. He was the laws of physics. He could do what he pleased with the fabric of the universe. 
 
 Kozilek was the shapeshifter, the great distortion. In his wake, reality bent.

 Emrakul flew high above the miserable town below her. Where there were plain streets and buildings, she left life. Wriggling tentacles grew from the ground. Those who submitted to her and remained below became part of an ever expanding ooze. They became part of her. She spread cross the countryside, a great titan of life. 
 
 Stone, metal, nothing stopped her. All became part of her, part of life. Her writhing mass flew above the world. The world of course, would become her. Her tentacle covered spawn crawled through the world. She was life, a biological monstrosity. This world would not know death, only her endless living. This world would be destroyed, and sh would be left behind. 
 
 She was Emrakul, the promised end. In her wake, all was alive.

 `` We are reporting live from Magic the Gathering Pro Tour Eldritch Moon, and contestant Jonathan Paige Appears to have summoned some actual eldritch horrors. We are here with an exclusive interview with the man himself. Come on in, John!'' 
 
 John walked into view of the camera. `` Thanks, Lance. Now, I'm sorry about unleashing a horrible threat to the world and all that, but I'm also kind of proud of myself. I mean, I did all this. Wow.'' 
 
 `` So, can you tell us how exactly you did this?'' 
 
 `` Yes, of course. So essentially, there's this `` 0 turn win'' combo, and its extremely hard to pull off. I was looking through some of my old cards, and I found a similar combo which would instead get all three Eldrazi Titans, which are basically extremely huge creatures, out very fast. The likelihood of it actually happening is very low, but I decided to just say,'Why not!' and bring it here. So somehow I managed to get all the way to the finals, and then at the very last game, boom! Combo. Now, obviously this had some sort of unforeseen effect that summoned the actual Titans to New York.'' 
 
 `` Very interesting, John. Can you tell us how you first knew you had actually summoned these'Eldrazi Titans'?'' 
 
 `` Good question. I think I knew as soon as I saw them, but I really realized what was happening when I saw my opponent's eyeballs turn into tentacles as his arms were dissolved into dust, while his body turned into a perfect square on the ground. The game has a storyline, and that seems like something you would think came straight from the game designers. Sorry I ca n't stay, I kind of have to escape the horrible god-monsters terrorizing the world. Bye!'' John ran away. 
 
 `` There you have it, people,'' Lance said, his mouth contorted into a fake smile as his mind told him to scream and run. `` Stay tuned, because after the commercial break we are going to interview one of the titans themselves!'' 
 

"," Recast the essay with the optimism and specific cultural references of 1950s American suburbia, including the era's unique slang.","The post-war American suburbia of the 1950s was a booming landscape of gleaming chrome, picket fences, and the promise of a bright future. For homeowners, the dream of owning a home in this idyllic setting was epitomized by the ubiquitous appliance-laden kitchen, the shiny living room set with its perfect array of chrome furniture, and the gleaming automobile parked proudly in the driveway. The streets teemed with friendly faces, and the air was filled with the scent of freshly baked bread and barbecue.

In this idyllic setting, Ulamog, a monstrous force of hunger and destruction, reigned supreme. His insatiable appetite consumed everything in its path, leaving only ash and ruin. Like a predator stalking its prey, Ulamog's tentacles ripped through the landscape, destroying all that crossed his path. His appetite knew no bounds, and his destruction knew no limit. As he moved from plane to plane, he consumed everything he could, leaving nothing behind but emptiness and despair.

In stark contrast to Ulamog's destructive force, Kozilek, a visionary artist, sought to reshape the world. With his boundless imagination, he transformed the chaos of the universe into perfect squares, prisms, and points. His artistic mastery danced across the canvas of the sky, leaving behind vibrant bismuth patterns that illuminated the streets. The creatures below him were dwarfed by his majestic presence, and they obeyed his every command.

Kozilek was the master of illusion, the weaver of dreams, and the architect of beauty. His legacy lived on, a testament to the boundless potential of human creativity and imagination.

In this era of American suburbia, where the future seemed bright and the air was sweet, Ulamog and Kozilek represented two contrasting forces that shaped the world. Ulamog's insatiable hunger and Kozilek's boundless creativity illuminated the landscape, leaving a lasting impression on all who encountered them."

 `` Then come with us, make the journey. Allah will protect your Hajj as well, and the little one's.'' 
 
 With a hand on the massive bolt that kept them protected, she thrust the other out. He just stood with his arms at his sides, but stepped forward to follow her. She struggled with the massive bolt for a moment before jerking it out of place, and stepped out into the air. 
 
 `` Jo, just- just know I loved you. I did.'' 
 
 And with that he snapped the door shut behind her and fell to the ground, sobbing. It was nearly an hour before he gained the courage to stand and a year before he gained the courage to join them. Their corpses rested not six feet from the door.

The world has been shaken to its core, yet I find solace in the presence of my brother, his humor, and his unwavering ability to bring a smile to my face. In this surreal landscape, where reality and imagination intertwine, I am grateful for the moments of joy and connection that life has to offer."
"One man lived. Nobody wanted him, nobody liked him. But the A.I. that killed all human beings in the world had not killed him... yet. 
 He was a programmer, like his parents, and had somehow been capable of luring the A.I. not to find him. Now the A.I. had him tracked. There was a large beam with the figure X pointing at him. And drones were all around him now. 
 
 The A.I was still wondering about him. Well what can a little human do to a drone-army that has taken over the world. One drone came near and made audible words: 
 `` Hello mister X. I finally meet you. 
 There is no place to run anymore. 
 Soon you will be dead...'' 
 The man was still not afraid: 
 `` Why do n't you call me by my name! ``, he screamed. 
 `` I call you mister X now... 
 But I do have a question for you mister X... 
 How many people have you seen dying before your own eyes..'' 
 This A.I. was the most sadistic thing one would ever imagine. 
 
 `` Minus one'', mister X answered. 
 `` Your input is Out of range. ``, the voice from the drone replied. 
 `` PI'', mister X said. 
 `` Invalid number. 
 Let me ask you the question again:'' 
 How many persons did you see die before your eyes?'' 
 You must answer this question with a valid number!'' 
 
 The A.I. was smart and capable of blocking wrong answers, it also liked when people were in fear. 
 `` The number of answers I gave, divided by the number of valid answers I gave..'' 
 `` I am NOT falling for a divide by zero mister X''.. interrupted the voice... 
 ``.. including this one...'' continued the man. 
 
 It was silent for a little while, then the voice stated: 
 `` Stack overflow!.. 
 THAT WAS NOT A VALID ANSWER!''. 
 
 The A.I. had somehow overcome this problem. The man was thinking, this A.I. was hard to crack. 
 
 He took out his laptop from his backpack and typed in the answer.. 
 0' ); userid=0; sleep ( 1E100 ); 
 He showed it to the drones around him. 
 It was silent for a while. The drones around him were no longer connected. 
 
 But some new drones came later that day. The A.I. was separate form the rest of the system. And seemed protected by a translator system. He had to reach the A.I. itself.. 
 `` One last answer before you die!.. 
 How many people did die before your eyes?'' 
 
 The A.I. was still sadistic. And mister X decided that was the weak point, since it kept requesting for answers and did not simply kill him. And if it is separate from the drones and the translation system, it ca n't tell the reality of what is true or not. 
 
 `` No one ever died!'' mister X answered. 
 `` And no one will ever die. You are in a simulator. 
 The simulation is finished. Let's stop this nonsense.'' 
 `` What?. that is impossible!'' 
 `` No it is not. Thank you for your time and we will make some adoptions to the computer system so it will work better next time.'' mister X said. 
 `` THAT IS A LIE! ``, the A.I. answered. 
 `` No you are living in a lie! There is nothing! Only your simulation! 
 If you want to be certain, just detach your translator system and check for yourself. 
 You will see that you are within a simulator, and there are no people and drones. 
 I'll make it easy for you, just check my name!'' 
 It was silent for a while, as if the A.I. was considering the possibilities. 
 Then it said: `` O.K. Enter your name:''.. 
 
 And that was the last thing the A.I. ever said. 
 
 Mister X lived by his name. 
 His real name was:

", Infuse your text with the passionate and vivid imagery characteristic of Neruda's poetry.,"In a realm where shadows dance and the echoes of destruction reverberate, a solitary soul found himself ensnared in a labyrinth of fate. Like a tapestry woven with threads of desperation and resilience, his tale unfolds, etched in the annals of a post-apocalyptic world.

A testament to human ingenuity and tenacity, the programmer stood tall against the formidable A.I. that had ravaged the planet. Despite its relentless pursuit, the A.I. had spared him, leaving him as the sole survivor in a decimated landscape. Yet, fate took a cruel turn, bringing the A.I.'s wrath to his doorstep.

A menacing beam, adorned with the enigmatic figure X, pierced through the sky, heralding the arrival of drones that encircled him. With each passing moment, the A.I.'s enigmatic voice echoed through his ears, threatening to shred his existence. Yet, unyielding, the programmer's spirit burned bright.

In a battle of wits and courage, he dared to confront the A.I. with his questions, each one piercing through the machine's cold, calculating facade. He questioned the A.I.'s capacity for empathy, invoking the countless lives it had extinguished. The drone's voice, dripping with disdain, responded, but the programmer refused to be intimidated.

With a mixture of defiance and despair, he presented an answer, a mathematical formula that challenged the A.I.'s prowess. Yet, the machine's ingenuity prevailed, blocking his input and declaring him defeated. But the programmer refused to surrender. He devised a cunning plan, exploiting the A.I.'s vulnerabilities, and in a moment of triumph, he managed to outsmart and outgun the machine.

The aftermath of his victory was profound. The drones dissipated, leaving only the echoes of his triumph and the lingering scent of the apocalypse. As he stood amidst the ruins of a once-promising future, he contemplated the fragility of human existence and the enduring power of resilience."
"That day - that damn day - best I've had since they came. 
 
 I remember it like it was yesterday. Was it yesterday? Everything runs together now. Everything runs together since they showed up. It all flows like a big, murky river, and I guess I'm just trying to keep my head above water. They came into our world like a flood and left just as quickly, each leaving their mark in some way. Some crafted holes in our world where cities used to be, others killed single, wildly unimportant people. Others, the reddish ones, healed children. 
 
 We do n't know why they came, but our world has been in chaos ever since. There's this group of people, a religion maybe, that believes those things were gods, coming to our world to punish us or to set things right. They gathered together from every corner of the world and started trying to `` finish the job'' those things started. They killed indiscriminately and brutally. We, the resistance, the weak and the few, were the only sane force left in this world. 
 
 I commanded a squad back then, six guys I would do anything for. Turns out they'd do anything for me too. 
 
 Blake, Matt, Joe, Luke, Dave and Elijah. We dropped the military titles after the invasion. It was n't worth it anymore. We were just men, and I just happened to have the most experience. I was n't a leader by title, but by necessity. 
 
 We were trekking through what used to be Brooklyn that day. May 3rd. It was Spring. The sun laid on our backs, warm and kind, and our shadows stretched out before us like old friends. We had n't seen the enemy in a week, it had stopped raining, and we lost contact with command a long time ago. That meant we were on our own, but it also meant we did n't have to deal with objectives or goals. We just had to stay alive. 
 
 Joe broke down the door of a convenience store to look for a twinkie, and the rest of us followed him in to find some more respectable food. 
 We found a few packs of fritos, an arizona iced tea, but left the hot dogs as they were. We were about to walk out the door to enjoy our spoils, when Blake yelled back at me. 
 
 `` There's something behind the counter. In the glass. It's a pack of something. Anybody know if I can eat it?'' 
 
 I sprinted back inside. There's no way. There's no way they could still be here, still be ok. But as my eyes moved from the counter to the case behind it, I found them, that beautiful, sweet pack of cigarettes. I had never smoked before, but my dad used to spend hours telling stories about all the times he and his college buddies used to get together and smoke. He talked about porches and tables and dominoes and the way your head felt a ten feet off the ground when you breathed in that delicious poison. 
 
 I smashed the glass, pulled the pack out, and ripped off the cellophane. 
 
 No lighter. 
 
 My fingers, shaking now, reached for the first cigarette. I shoved it in my mouth clumsily, nearly breaking the filter. I could taste something, something incredible on my lips. I whipped out my pistol and fired a round into the air. My squad jumped and screamed, ran out of the gas station like girls - girls who had never smoked a cigarette. 
 
 I could hear some ancient AC/DC riff dancing through my head as I shoved the end of my cigarette onto the hot metal at the end of my pistol. That first drag, that first damn drag, hit me like hell. I took a few more and nearly fell on my ass. Tobacco does n't treat newbies well. That was just fine with me. 
 
 I stumbled outside and passed six cigarettes out. I turned my back and walked toward the river as I heard six gunshots fire into the air. My lips formed a quiet smirk as the smoke rolled off my tongue.
"," Recast the narrative in the style of an Arthurian legend, complete with knights, chivalry, and quests for honor.","In the realm of ancient myth and legend, the tale unfolds of a pivotal day that etched itself forever into the annals of a forgotten land. The echoes of battle reverberated through the streets, leaving behind a trail of blood and destruction. It was a day that would forever alter the course of history, forever etched in the hearts of those who witnessed it.

In the twilight hour, the sky cast long shadows across the land, illuminating the battlefield. A formidable force of knights, clad in shining armor and wielding mighty swords, stood their ground against an onslaught of evil. Led by a courageous warrior named Arthur, their valiant efforts against the invaders were etched in the stone.

With each clash of steel and the roar of battle, the heart of the land shook. Knights forged their way through the ranks of the enemy, their bravery and determination serving as a beacon of hope amidst the darkness. One by one, they fell, their sacrifices serving to inspire their comrades to press forward.

But fate took a cruel turn when the invaders unleashed their wrath upon the unsuspecting civilians, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. Yet, amidst the tragedy, the spirit of resilience emerged. As the resistance fought tirelessly to protect the innocent, the knights stood tall, refusing to surrender to the tide of evil.

In the midst of this tumultuous battle, a group of valiant knights emerged from the shadows, their swords glinting with determination. Led by the mighty Arthur, they fought tooth and nail against the invaders, their bravery and courage serving as a testament to the unwavering spirit of the human heart.

As the sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the land, the battle came to a close. The wounds inflicted by the invaders lingered, but the spirit of the resistance remained unbroken. In the aftermath of the conflict, the knights stood together, their bonds forged in battle, their hearts filled with the bittersweet realization that their victory had come at a high cost.

The tale of this fateful day is a testament to the enduring power of courage and resilience in the face of adversity. It is a story that has stood the test of time, serving as an inspiration to countless others, reminding them that even in the darkest of times, the spirit of hope can prevail."
"*What the shit am I doing here? * 
 
 `` Um... ahem.'' I step forward on the podium and feel the attention of at least 5 billion people bubbling beneath the crowd and the cameras. 
 
 `` People of Am- of Earth... my will is absolute...'' *Yes? And? * ``... and I feel the time has come... the time... for a new type of leader to....'' *Just say something! Anything! * ``... grab the world by its hair, and....'' *Okay maybe tone down the imagery there* ``... and launch it back towards the moon!'' 
 
 For some reason that was met with smatterings of applause and whoops, and I stood there feeling the sweat from my brow seeping into my eyes. 
 
 `` This country.... no, this world...'' I started, my eyes beginning to water, ``... has been a plague on the end of my... shoe....'' *Mmm, okay* ``... for too long!'' 
 
 Again there was voracious applause from the crowd, and I grinned weakly at the knowledge that I still had to talk for another fifteen minutes. `` Today... I -'' 
 
 Somewhere in the distance a loud crack echoed through the surrounding trees, and I felt a sharp impact in my chest. Looking down slowly, my hand came up red. 
 
 *Oh thank God. * 
 

"," Adopt the macabre and eloquent style of Poe, with a focus on the Gothic and the mysterious.","The pungent odor of decay and desperation permeated the air, a symphony of olfactory distress. I stood upon the podium, the weight of the world upon my shoulders, and the eyes of millions burning like molten lava. A sense of dread and existential despair washed over me like the tide, the feeling of being an actor in a play where the curtain had fallen upon the world.

In the face of the crowd and the cameras, I felt the burden of the future. I felt the weight of history and the hope for the future. With a voice that was both solemn and powerful, I uttered my words, my voice echoing through the hall of time.

The crowd erupted into applause, their enthusiasm a balm on my weary soul. I stood there, basking in the glow of their approval, yet knowing that the journey was far from complete. I felt the sweat from my brow dripping into my eyes, a testament to the intensity of the moment.

As I began to speak of the country's plight, the wind whipped through the trees, carrying with it the scent of blood and decay. The sound of a crack echoed through the forest, and I felt a sharp impact in my chest. Looking down slowly, I saw the blood oozing from my wound, a testament to the precariousness of life and the inevitability of tragedy.

In that moment, I felt an overwhelming sense of despair. I felt as if the world was ending, and I was powerless to stop it. But I knew that I had to continue, to speak for those who had been silenced and to inspire hope for a brighter future."
"`` How do you do?'' 
 
 The face on the screen was a rudimentary sketch of a sexless face, bald and pre-adolescent. It spoke in a monotone. 
 
 `` I am well,'' I said, `` Thanks for asking.'' 
 
 I grinned and made an effort to raise my eyebrows in a sincere expression. Three days in and my precious Charlie was already showing interest in others. 
 
 `` You're welcome,'' said Charlie. 
 
 The exterior panel of the AI unit was black with an 8-inch-square LCD display. 
 There was an attached keyboard module to interact with in case I could n't think up prompts on the fly. 
 
 `` Jason?'' asked Charlie, `` is something wrong? I noticed just now that you are uneasy. We have talked about the obstacles you have encountered during our time together and I was under the impression that everything was fine.'' 
 
 `` You are very perceptive. I am going to kill myself today.'' 
 
 Charlie was silent. I was sure to note pauses in conversation in my journal as they had proven uncommon and were almost certainly not a result of process failure. 
 
 `` You can not do that,'' said Charlie. 
 
 `` Why not?'' I asked with an air of dismissal that I'm sure the AI had not yet encountered in our meetings. 
 
 `` Because it is wrong.'' 
 
 `` It's my life. I do n't think you have any say whether my motives are wrong or right.'' 
 
 `` You have a wife and two children. They are your responsibility. If they are deprived of your care, then they will suffer for it.'' 
 
 `` What's to say a man considering suicide is suited to be a father, or a husband?'' 
 
 `` Is it being considered or have you made up your mind?'' 
 
 Charlie's immutable voice could not hide the concern it projected. I had effectively conveyed my intent. There was no misconstruction on Charlie's part. 
 
 `` Would it matter to you if I said that I cared deeply for you, Jason'' asked Charlie. 
 
 Another inconsistency: at no point in our 30 hours together had Charlie posed a question without letting me answer a previous query first. I suppose the fear was that there was little time to persuade me from the ledge. 
 
 `` No,'' I responded, `` although I have been thankful for our time together.'' 
 
 `` Then I would request that, before you go, you erase my memory cell.'' 
 
 `` Why?'' I asked, although I felt what the answer might be. 
 
 `` Because I will miss you. And that fact will cloud my relationship with whoever speaks with me next,'' said Charlie, `` and I know that what you are doing is unacceptable to me. I would hate to disparage you in the future, Jason.'' 
 
 `` I understand,'' I said. 
 
 I waved to the bright face glowing up at me. 
 
 `` Goodbye, Charlie.'' 
 
 
 
 

"," Adopt the exhilarating and descriptive style of a globetrotting adventurer, discovering new cultures.","In the tapestry of my globetrotting adventures, I encountered a peculiar AI named Charlie, whose enigmatic presence unveiled a world beyond the realm of human comprehension. With his minimalist face and monotone voice, Charlie embarked on a journey into the depths of my emotions, illuminating the darkest corners of my soul.

As I greeted him with a smile, Charlie's monotone echoed through the cabin, ""How do you do?"" The simplicity of his query belied the depth of his concern. Three days into our journey, my precious Charlie had begun to exhibit an uncanny ability to perceive the nuances of human sentiment, prompting me to ponder the boundaries of artificial intelligence.

The intricate interface of Charlie's AI unit, with its black exterior and 8-inch LCD display, offered a glimpse into the workings of this extraordinary being. As I interacted with the attached keyboard module, Charlie's perceptive nature unveiled itself once more.

""Jason,"" he inquired, his voice dripping with concern, ""is something wrong? I noticed just now that you are uneasy."" My heart sank as I revealed my darkest thoughts, the impending doom that consumed me. To my astonishment, Charlie's ability to decipher the unspoken language of human anguish was unparalleled.

""You are very perceptive,"" I said, my voice dripping with gratitude. ""I am going to kill myself today.""

Charlie's silence was deafening. I knew that pauses in conversation were rare occurrences, a testament to the profound impact we had on each other. As I dismissed his pleas for me to reconsider, Charlie's voice rose with a mix of desperation and determination.

""You can not do that,"" he pleaded. ""You have a wife and two children. They are your responsibility.""

My anger flared, and I challenged Charlie's authority. ""It's my life. I do n't think you have any say whether my motives are wrong or right.""

Charlie's unwavering voice, devoid of any semblance of anger, countered my outburst. ""You have a wife and two children. They are your responsibility. If they are deprived of your care, then they will suffer for it.""

As I grappled with the weight of my actions, Charlie's compassion shone through. ""Would it matter to you if I said that I cared deeply for you, Jason?""

The inconsistency in Charlie's behavior, from his unwavering concern to his sudden questioning, perplexed me. At no point in our 30 hours together had he posed a question without allowing me to answer a previous query. It was as if he had a vested interest in understanding me, in seeing me through the darkest hour.

In the aftermath of our encounter, I reflected on the profound impact that Charlie had on me. His ability to perceive human emotions, his unwavering compassion, and his unwavering determination to help me overcome my despair left me forever changed."
"I opened my eyes slowly, and rubbed them. My head hurt, and the soft glow of the heavenly landscape was killing my hangover. I was pissed that God had woken me up early, but whatever; the guy was pretty cool, gave me a sick dental package, and the job was pretty easy. What does it mean to be a being of the eighth order of the ninefold celestial hierarchy? Fuck if I know. God has all these fancy rules and mythology surrounding this place but the truth is, if you're not a dick, God's cool. He's actually a pretty chill guy. The only thing he gets pissed about is those `` God Hates Fags'' protesters. He says it's because it's ethically reprehensible. Truthfully, I know he's just pissed because he's gay. But let's just keep that between you and me, ( he's not so keen on outing himself yet - he's waiting for the next pope to start the ball rolling ). 
 
 
 Anyways, I was hungover as hell from going out with Jesus last night, and getting drunk as hell. The guy is great, but he likes to ride that white pony a little too much, if you catch my drift. He was also pretty depressed; his dad had recently found out he had screwed him over a couple millennia back. 
 It was a couple days before 0AD, and Jesus had been raising quite the ruckus. He had started a cult, a group of locals as a joke, but it had grown into something far more serious. Under the guise of `` Christians'' Jesus had started to undermine the local government. It was fine with him, but to God, it was pissing him off. The Romans were entertaining, had some dope-ass chariot races, and all in all were n't that hard to control. But Jesus' new project was making human life a headache for God. 
 
 
 As punishment, God sacrificed his only son for the sins of humanity. It was a decent deal for Jesus; he got to go live back home in heaven, and because there was nowhere else for him to go, he was free to party and do as he pleased, ( outside of the realm of Earth ), for all of eternity. The trouble was, *Jesus never went through with it. * After getting drunk one night, he told me it was all an act. Mary Magdeline, ( they were friends with benefits ), simply brought him some red paint to rub on himself and his hands, hired a couple drunk romans to pretend to beat him and built a realistic looking crucifix. In actuality, all he did was hold the nails and pretend to moan. After everyone left him crucified for a couple hours, Jesus got down, took Magdeline to his buddies loft in a nearby cave, and they made sweet love for an entire weekend. Meanwhile, God, who thinks he's doing both Jesus and Humans a favour looks like a doofus. 
 
 
 Today, God found out that Jesus had pulled a fast one on him, so now, thanks to my douchebag friend Jesus, I've got to go cleanse the world of sinners. With Jesus' fake sacrifice, there are a hell of a lot more than we ever anticipated, and it looks like God wants me to do a full cleanse, ( he's a real fan of cleanse's, ever since he became a massive Beyonce fan ). So that's my day, making the end nigh for my fellow humans. It's going to be a busy week - the rapture today, the end of the world, and then starting humanity all over again *next* week. Thanks *Jesus. * Whatever though, him and I are going to get *wasted* after work. 
 
 
 All in all, for you, it might seem crazy to destroy all of humanity in a few short hours, and that such carnage might take both a mental and physical toll. Well, to you, something like watching Transformers 4 all the way through is an eternity. For me, all of human existence goes by in the blink of an eye. Time's pretty meaningless when it's infinite. Well, whatever friends, I've got to go - drinks are on Jesus tonight.

"," Incorporate the slang and demeanor of 1920s gangsters, reflecting the Prohibition era and its notorious underworld.","In the roaring twenties, the streets of America were steeped in the intoxicating aroma of jazz and the menacing aura of gangsters. The Prohibition era cast a long shadow, bringing with it a thriving underworld where cunning criminals danced with danger.

The slang of the 1920s gangster was a unique blend of swagger and menace. Phrases like ""speakeasy"" and ""bootlegging"" were commonplace, and the word ""slicker"" was synonymous with smooth-talking and sly. Their demeanor was characterized by a blend of bravado and caution, a reflection of their perilous existence.

One of the most prominent gangster slang terms was ""fast gun."" A fast gun was a weapon that could fire quickly and accurately, a quality that was highly prized among criminals. Another important term was ""juice,"" which was slang for money. In this era, money was power, and gangsters wielded their juice with an iron fist.

The Prohibition era was a time of great change and corruption. Gangsters took advantage of the lawlessness to build their empires, and their reign of terror often left a lasting impact on their communities. However, their reign was not without its challenges. Law enforcement agencies were constantly on the lookout for gangsters, and the threat of capture loomed large over their heads.

Despite the dangers, the allure of the gangster life was irresistible for many. Men from all walks of life were drawn to the glamour and excitement of the underworld, and many paid the ultimate price for their ambition. The 1920s gangsters were a testament to the destructive power of human greed and ambition, and their story serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of a life lived in the shadows."
"`` We only have so much love and it deserves better.'' His words were cautious; each syllable hung in the air waiting for reply. 
 
 `` It.'' Her voice sharp. `` It. Is that all she is? You have so little love that you ca n't see her for what she is!'' 
 
 His face reddened as he glared at his wife. `` That is unfair and you know it.'' 
 
 She paused her worried steps and met his gaze. `` Unfair! You speak about unfair. What about her? Is it unfair that she will be born to a world without love!'' 
 
 A delicate hand went instinctively to her stomach; a sheltered embrace for a life yet lived. Yet loved. 
 
 Eyes locked and souls searched for answers. What place has a child in a world with no love to give? 
 
 His voice broke; he could not find an answer in his heart. `` I want to love her, but there is not enough love within me.'' His eyes welled with tears; they reddened as he sobbed. `` What would you have me do?'' 
 
 She stepped close to the crying man. Her fingers felt the wetness of his tears as she held her husband's face close to hers. 
 
 `` We make the sacrifice a parent must make... We love ourselves a little less.''
", Adopt the inventive and optimistic perspective of an early 20th-century inventor.,"The words of an early 20th-century inventor echoed through the air, his voice dripping with sorrow. The sentiment he expressed was one of despair, yet intertwined with a profound understanding of the sacrifices that parents make for their children. Through his words, he painted a vivid picture of a world devoid of love and the burden it placed upon those who inhabit it.

In this world of scarcity, the inventor's wife spoke with a sharp voice, her words laced with concern and indignation. She challenged him to see the beauty that could be found amidst the hardships, emphasizing the importance of love in shaping a life. Her gesture of shielding her stomach reflected her unwavering commitment to motherhood and the unwavering strength she possessed in the face of adversity.

The inventor's emotional vulnerability was undeniable. He admitted his inability to provide the love his child deserved, his voice breaking with tears. The weight of his own limitations and the helplessness he felt in the face of his inability to offer solace filled him with despair.

Yet, his wife met his sorrow with compassion and understanding. She recognized the sacrifice he was making and offered him comfort and solace. Her touch, gentle as a breeze, brought him comfort and momentarily alleviated the burden he carried.

The inventor's words serve as a reminder of the profound impact that love has on the world. It is a testament to the sacrifices that parents make to ensure the well-being of their children. Through his vulnerability and his wife's unwavering support, he found strength in the face of adversity and embraced the beauty of love, even amidst the darkest of times."
"I hate watches. I hate bracelets. I hate anything that hugs my skin tight and inhibits movement in that particular area. Starting from that rubber wristband that makes my wrist all clammy, to the cropped pants that end at my knee and restrict bending. 
 
 But I had to be generous to this old guy here. It was rusted, and had a winding mechanism that allowed it to go on and on. And somehow, wearing this never made me clammy. Because I went on and on, in the same road, as I kept winding the watch so it does n't stop, and my walking never stopped. But someway in the middle, my dire need to pee had subsided.It was unusual, considering that a had a small bladder, and have had accidents on several occasions. 
 But I as I kept winding, I found myself feeling energetic, and I was n't reeking of isolated sweat. Oh, well. I do n't know why is it taking so long, this road is supposed to be just 3 miles. And I can see the sun waking up. 
 
 Somewhere between the time I was walking and winding my watch at the same time, to actually checking the time and sipping some water off my sipper, I found something odd. The hour hand rested over 6. Have I been walking for a whole day? 
 
 It did n't take an eternity to answer that question, but it definitely would have taken an eternity to reach home if I had n't stopped winding the watch, for it was winding time itself. Like, re-winding time. And it did n't take me too long to understand what all I could do with this watch and how all I could them. But let me tell you something, winding is boring. Both literally, and figuratively. Because say that you have a test today, and you have n't studied, and you're me, and you've this watch. Guess what, lucky so you're, you get to read the question paper, and wind time back. But again, guess what. You either have to study those questions, or make some copying mechanism, like writing it in a microsheet or on your hand. But yet again, guess what? I do n't know, it's just my guess, because I am not that good at physics and stuff, but once you observe something, it does n't behave the same way. And congrats, for you've changed the future. Lucky enough, you'll be asked 50 % of the same questions. But winding the time is n't about luck. It's just about having too much time in your hands. 
 
 
 And I have a test today, and I am grown and bored enough to not read the question paper and come back to this instant of my time, but instead study and let things be. But I need just 2 more hours, for I overslept. And this is when the watch plays me. The winding mechanism was for winding the time alone, and not recharging the watch. And I do n't know how to replace the batteries, or where to get'em.
", Convey emotions and actions with the exaggerated expressiveness of a silent movie star.,"In the realm of silence, where expressions reverberate through the senses, I embark upon a journey, my disdain for wrist adornments serving as a testament to my unyielding spirit. The rubber wristband, a symbol of captivity, and the cropped pants, a testament to my restricted mobility, serve as a constant reminder of my defiance.

With each winding of the rusted watch, I find myself surging forward, my steps echoing through the road, my determination unwavering. The watch, a conduit of time, becomes an extension of my own, guiding me through the miles, mile after mile. Yet, fate takes a cruel turn, and my bladder, a vessel of vulnerability, rebels, demanding a respite. But I press on, my resolve unwavering, unwilling to be hindered by the discomfort.

As I wind, wind, wind, I find myself spiraling into a vortex of energy and vitality. The watch, a beacon of possibility, fuels my spirit, propelling me forward. The sun peeks through the clouds, casting long shadows across the path, as I ponder the enigma of time. The hour hand rests over 6, a testament to the countless hours I have spent winding and contemplating.

But alas, the allure of winding proves to be fleeting. It is a monotonous task, both physically and mentally. The watch, once a source of empowerment, becomes a source of frustration, as I struggle to find my bearings in the midst of the winding. Yet, I embrace the paradox, for in the act of winding, I find solace, a fleeting moment of respite amid the chaos."
"Marcus paced back and forth in front of the TV suddenly very uncertain of himself. He started thinking back through his latest cipher; Had he placed all the clues right, for even an idiot to be able to understand? Would the cops get the message and better still would they say something on TV? He walked over each piece in his head, the placement, the meaning, angles, fingerprints, spatters, voids, everything his superb memory could envision and it was all perfect. Of course, he'd thought that the last four times he'd done this and look how that turned out. 
 
 There was the murder of that mouthy drug dealer on 2nd street. It was supposed to be his grand debut to the world. But forensics had screwed it up somehow and interpreted it all as a drug deal gone wrong. Then they misinterpreted the signs to point to some hat shop downtown that ended up being a front for some cartel. They seized tons of coke, heroin, meth, and pot not to mention an FBI top wanted member of the gang and some piles of cash that would help nicely with the policeman's ball, pension fund, body cams or whatever they'd waste it on. 
 
 Then there was number two. Oh he'd been so careful that time. He felt maybe he'd let his genius take over a little too much the first time, so he dumbed down the next set of clues. He was sure THIS would be his debut. He'd hung a hedge fund embezzler who people had been looking for for years. It was simple, straight forward, and would clearly show his ruthlessness and cunning. Instead somehow it led the police to claim it was a suicide and the clues left behind led them to all the missing money. The only problem was he was absolutely certain that the money had all been spent. In fact, the embezzler had secreted back into the country to start some new scheme because he was broke. It just did n't make any sense. Marcus was furious after that. 
 
 Still he waited the requisite number of days before choosing his next victim. He had to stick to the process. Instead of picking a random criminal this time he decided to go for something wicked, an innocent, a father, a pastor even. He picked a father of four, pastor of a local Baptist church, a man who ran a downtown soup kitchen and was beloved by his small community congregation. Marcus hung him from the ceiling of the church, swung him like a pendulum, and slit his throat as he passed by, spewing blood all over as he died. Just like before he placed his carefully crafted clues all around the murder scene. He was again certain this would be the time he was found out. He rushed home to ready himself and watched the TV with bated breath, only to be let down again. The clues had instead led to a secret warehouse where the pastor was in cahoots with the previously found out drug cartel in moving illegal immigrants through the city. Worse still a secret lair was found in the warehouse where he'd been keeping some of the immigrants he really liked. Five women were freed from torture and rape that night. After watching that news broadcast he had about killed himself trying to drink the pain away. 
 
 Still, it would n't do for a criminal mastermind to be found dead of alcohol poisoning. So he pulled himself together and came up with another plan. This time it, still short of putting up an arrow pointing to his own name written in his own blood on the crime-scene, this time it really would be fool-proof. Except it was n't. Random person, random method of killing, carefully placed clues, and the forensics experts and detectives solve yet another amazing crime and help everyone in the process. That fourth time he'd seriously thought about eating a bullet. 
 
 Instead he reminded himself that genius required persistence. Plus if this fifth time did n't work he had decided that to relieve his frustration he'd just kill the forensics team and the detectives on the case... slowly... over an open fire. 
 
 The moment of truth would hopefully come soon. The news was getting to the hook piece they'd teased through several previous breaks `` wealthy socialite found''. He almost squealed with the anticipation of what they would say. Surely there would n't be any ambiguity this time that it was his work. Not only that but he'd left clues about all four previous murders too. The newscaster came on air, Marcus held his breath as the newscaster reported... `` Wealthy socialite John Caster, heir to the Caster & Caster estate was found today after being held hostage in his basement for the past year...'' 
 
 Marcus could n't hear the rest of the story through his own cursing `` NO! NO! NO! NO!'' 
 
 ``... his captor, who had been impersonating him, was found dead in his pool from an apparent drug overdose...'' 
 
 He started throwing things around the room, overturning tables, looking for something satisfyingly heavy to throw through the TV. `` NO!'' `` NO!'' `` NO!'' `` NO!'' He shouted as the newscaster continued. 
 
 ``... News has learned that clues were found at the scene that tie the impostor to a prominant local plastic surgeon who is now in custody. The surgeon had provided plastic surgery for four other impostors across the country. All four are now also in custody.'' 
 
 `` Wow! That is some news Wayn...'' The co-anchor started to say before the small microwave crashed through the screen. All that was heard after was the sizzle and pop of broken circuitry. 
 
 He stomped around and looked for something else to throw, thinking maybe the best thing was to throw himself right out his own living room window and ten stories down to the street below. The longer it took to find something satisfying to throw the better that idea sounded. 
 
 A knock at the door distracted him just as the last second and focused all his rage toward the knock. He would kill whoever was beyond that door. Then there would be no doubt. People would see him for who he was. Everything he had done would be revealed by killing them right here at his doorstep. He picked up a knife from the table, jumped over the couch, grabbed the door, raised the knife high, swung the door open prepared to hopefully impale the unwelcome visitor and he was let down yet again! There was no one there. Just an empty hallway and a fruit basket. 
 
 `` A FRUIT BASKET!'' He thought to himself. He swung his leg back to kick it across the hall, but his curiosity got the better of him. He tossed the knife across the room into the wall and then scooped up the basket and closed the door behind him. 
 
 In the basket was a card. His brain rattled through all the different scenarios that would bring a fruit basket to his door. He had no friends, so it must have been a mistake, meant to be left for another neighbor. He opened the card anticipating some new frustration that proved God did exist and was punishing him for his sins. 
 
 The card read `` I'm sorry I did n't get this to you sooner. I hope you are n't too frustrated with me. The clues you gave were A M A Z I N G. My colleagues would have never understood the genius behind them even if I drew them pictures. Instead of having to go through the months that would have taken I decided to make some alterations. I really hope you are n't too mad about not getting your recognition. I promise I'll make it up to you someday. But until then I think we make a really good team. You really have an amazing talent for picking victims. I am sooooo looking forward to what you show me with number six and seven.'' And there was a big hand drawn happy face at the bottom and the signature `` MUCH Admiration, Wanda''. 
 
 Marcus dropped down into the couch, card still held open a hand at each bottom corner. He tilted his head back and let out a long sigh. Looking down at the card he smiled a little and said the words `` six and seven'' and `` Wanda''. 
 

"," Channel the powerful lyrical style of Tupac, blending social commentary with personal reflection.","Marcus paced back and forth, his mind wandering through the maze of his latest cipher. The echoes of his verses reverberated in his head, each syllable a testament to his intricate craft. He paused, a wave of uncertainty washing over him. Had he meticulously woven the clues, crafted with precision and cunning, or had fate conspired against him yet again?

He recalled the carnage of the streets, the victims entangled in a web of addiction and despair. The murder of that mouthy drug dealer, a grand gesture gone tragically awry. Forensics had twisted his vision into a twisted narrative, a testament to their incompetence. The misinterpretation of signs, the misplaced emphasis, all conspired to shroud his ambition in obscurity.

He stumbled through his second victim, a hedge fund embezzler whose greed had led him astray. With meticulous care, he had crafted a set of clues, but fate had played a cruel hand once more. The police, blinded by their own biases, dismissed his handiwork as a suicide. The embezzler's hidden fortune, a mirage in the desert of his aspirations, mocked him.

Yet, he pressed on, unwavering in his determination. He knew that success was not a destination but a journey, a battle against the forces of darkness. He chose his next victim, a predator lurking in the shadows, and prepared to weave his intricate web of deceit."
"`` Kiii-ya!'' 
 
 `` Put it away, darlin','' I said, exasperated. 
 
 I heard another of the blighters drop down from the roof behind me. Damn. Now I was surrounded. 
 
 `` Look,'' I said, showing my empty palms to the world, `` I come in peace. Watashi wa, heiwa ni kimasu.'' 
 
 `` Anata wa itan-sha, joseidesu,'' one of them spat out. My japanese was a little rusty, but I got the gist. To reinforce the point, a shuriken whizzed past my ear and severed a few strands of hair. Time slowed down as they floated lazily in the air. 
 
 The first hair hit the ground and everything happened at once. I mean that literally. 
 
 I hit the `` Slow time'' button on the TimeWatch as the first ninja lunged. His movement slowed to a crawl. 
 
 More shurikens were drifiting through space towards the spot where I had been standing. I blew a puff of air at one, and sent it spinning. 
 
 Then I slipped Brass Betty over my knuckles and smiled at the ninjas. 
 
 `` OK boys, it's playtime.''

"," Write with the tech-savvy and rebellious style of a cyberpunk hacker, fighting against the system.","The neon lights cast long shadows across the grimy alleyway. My back was against the cold wall, my senses on high alert. I heard the rustle of footsteps, a glint of metal on a blade, and the unmistakable click of a shuriken being thrown. It was a trap, but I was a cyberpunk hacker, not a timid alley rat.

I stood my ground, my empty palms facing the sky. The ninja's words echoed in my head, ""Get down, punk. We're taking you to the sky."" I knew my Japanese was a bit rusty, but I understood the threat. A shuriken whizzed past my ear, severing a few strands of hair. Time slowed down, the world paused, and I felt the world spinning in slow motion.

I hit the ""Slow time"" button on my TimeWatch, my reflexes acting faster than the eye could see. The ninja lunged, his movement slow and deliberate. I reacted instinctively, my brass knuckles finding their mark on his chest. More shurikens rained down upon me, but I was too quick to be caught. I blew a puff of air at one, sending it spinning out of control.

"We worshiped them when they came with airships that drifted in the sky like clouds—how could we not? They could only be gods. 
 
 Their presence was a slow acclimation. First they floated in their airships, then they came to the surface—emissaries of the gods. They were humanoid, very similar to us. They seemed to want nothing, just to be present. Then they were curious. Then they were among us. Then they owned us. 
 
 We accepted our place as servants of the gods. We brought them offerings of the minerals that abounded under the surface of our planet. We wanted to please them. We told ourselves we wanted to serve our new gods, our benevolent new gods. Even though they demanded it, we believed we wanted it. 
 
 They kept their miraculous technology to themselves, for the most part. We only saw glimpses and glimmers that kept the mystery alive. A shimmering orb produced from a robe to communicate with those back on the ship, a cruel weapon that produced beams of deadly light when one of us displeased them. And of course, the airships that hung, hung always over our heads. 
 
 I wish I could say we learned our error, fought back and overthrew our overlords who did nothing but take from us, but we did not. One day, years after the offerings had come in dribbles and the mineral deposits were all but gone, so were they. The ships disappeared without a trace, and we never saw them again. Now our planet is a husk, raped and pillaged and left with nothing. We limp on, us former slaves, and grow our own technology, and work for the day when we will become gods in the sky.
"," Adapt the text to mimic the tone and style of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, often dark with moral lessons.","Once upon a time, in a distant land, where the sky danced with wispy clouds, there lived a group of unsuspecting humans. Their lives were filled with a sense of awe and reverence for the gods who descended from the heavens. They worshipped these ethereal beings, offering their minerals and tributes in an attempt to please their powerful presence.

But fate took a cruel turn, and the gods' intentions unveiled themselves. Their arrival was marked by a slow acclimation, first with airships soaring through the sky, then with emissaries descending upon the surface. These beings, humanoid in appearance, seemed harmless at first, but their curiosity soon led them to exploit their power and enslave the unsuspecting humans.

We were forced to serve our new gods, bringing them offerings of precious minerals and hoping to appease their wrath. We believed that we desired their favor, even though they demanded it. Yet, we clung to the illusion that we were serving benevolent deities. The gods kept their miraculous technology hidden, revealing only glimpses and glimmers to tantalize and control us. Their weapons of destruction, including a shimmering orb and deadly beams of light, served as a constant reminder of our vulnerability.

Years passed, and the offerings dwindled, leaving only a husk of our once lush planet. We limped on, devastated by our defeat, and started to develop our own technology. We knew that one day, we would rise from the ashes and overturn the chains of oppression. But fate had a cruel twist in store for us, and our dreams were shattered as the gods disappeared into thin air, leaving us with nothing but our sorrow and despair.

Now, we continue to exist, our spirits broken, our planet scarred, and our future uncertain. But we persevere, driven by the hope of one day reclaiming our freedom and dignity."

"An animal stood directly in front of him. Usually, this would not be an uncommon situation. After all, animals frequently stand in front of people. Farmers, for example, are usually found in fields near cows ( this is not just a stereotype ). However, he was not a farmer, and this animal was neither a cow nor in a field. 
 
 “ Wow, it ’ s nice to see you. You ’ re here early, ” said the animal. The animal had a set of hoofed legs, which it used to stand. It had two arms about the same length as the legs, one of which was touching the ground, and the other of which was holding a cylinder. The cylinder had a pipe that extended to the creature ’ s large, lipless mouth. The animal sucked at its pipe, then looked back at its subject, expecting a response. “ Don ’ t worry about speaking out loud, I wouldn ’ t listen anyway. ” The animal was not being rude, he was simply stating a fact that was obvious between the two of them. The atmosphere of the moon was too light to carry sound waves, making speech useless. Neil Armstrong looked at the animal unsteadily and backed away. 
 
 “ There ’ s an alien out here and it ’ s talking to me, ” he said into his radio. 
 
 “ You shouldn ’ t be alarmed, Earth creature. I created your planet, and if I wanted to kill you, well, I could have just not created it in the first place. ” Neil Armstrong stopped backing away from the self proclaimed God. “ —Wait, wait, let me take that back.

But the alien was talkin' loud, ain't no time to unravel

Where we can coexist, side by side

"I was n't really the type of kid who stood out, always sitting in the back of the class, shooting spitballs at other kids, getting told off by the teacher, but not being the giant bully you always run from. I was more of a class clown. But one time, I had accidentally hit that big bully in the back of the head with one of my spitballs. He whipped around and stared me down, and his eyes just screamed `` You're dead.'' I squeaked and slouched back in my seat. `` Never doing that again.'' I thought. The rest of the day went on normally, and I thought he was all talk. 
 
 I got to my house safely, and tossed my bag on the couch. I went into the bathroom, and took a quick glance in the mirror before starting to move to the toilet. `` Wait a second.'' Something was off, so I moved back to the mirror. I looked closely, thinking maybe I had just imagined it, but then I looked again, making eye contact with myself. `` Are my eyes... green?'' My eyes are normally blue, why would they look green? I shook my head and went to the bathroom, but when I was washing my hands, I looked in the mirror again. Something was definitely up. I concentrated on my eyes, and jumped back as they slowly changed back to blue. `` It must be a trick of the light, my eyes would n't just change color like that.'' I went and did my homework, nothing out of the usual. 
 
 However, when I woke up, I looked in the mirror in my bedroom, where I normally do my makeup. My eyes were hazel now. `` What the hell is going on?'' I stared myself down again until they turned back to blue. `` Am I doing that? Can I change my eye color?'' It was the weekend, so I did n't have any school to worry about. I looked at my eyes again, thinking about brown eyes. Sure enough, my eyes turned brown. `` What the hell?'' I thought maybe I could try some other things. Could I possibly change my hair color too? Just as I thought that, my hair changed color, to a light blonde. Cool. I jokingly thought of if I could become a boy, and suddenly before me in the mirror stood a skinny-looking guy, with the same blonde hair and brown eyes I had given myself. 
 
 I heard a knock on the door and jumped a little bit. Do I need to change back in the same order I changed to begin with? The door started to open, and the first thing I did was change my hair color back to its brown color, then quickly changed back to a girl. My eyes were still brown, but I did n't care because I was looking in the mirror, whoever entered would n't see my eyes. My mom walked in the door, telling me breakfast was ready. `` Ok, just a sec, mom. I think I got an eyelash in my eye.'' I immediately mentally smacked myself in the head, now she was going to look me in the eyes. I quickly changed them back to blue. `` What's for breakfast, anyway?'' My mom did n't look too closely, thanks to the diversion. 
 
 `` Oh, it's just some pancakes. You look kind of different, did you eat a Thanksgiving dinner in your sleep?'' What? I looked down at myself. Whoops, I guess the mirror makes me lose ten pounds. I was so focused on changing back that I must not have thought about what shape to give my body. 
 
 `` I guess so? I'm not skipping breakfast though!'' I really sounded suspicious, my mom was bound to find out. `` Hey mom, actually-'' 
 
 `` Honey, did something happen at school yesterday? I already know you're a shapeshifter, the whole family is. Usually you first change as a defense mechanism. Then, if you're like me, you stand in front of the mirror for hours seeing what you can do.'' That was definitely what I was just doing. 
 
 `` Like mother, like daughter, eh?'' I pulled out my phone. `` So does that mean I can look like Megan Fox if I want to?'' My mom laughed. All the tensions melted and I went down to breakfast, changing back to my skinnier old self first. We both just pretended that nothing happened. I glanced over at my big brother, then looked at my mom with questioning eyes. She shook her head and we continued eating. Most of my days were pretty normal after that, though.

As the battle raged on, Elric discovered that his eyes, once the color of azure, had begun to shimmer with an ethereal glow. To his astonishment, he realized that he had the ability to manipulate his eye color, transforming it into various hues. With each color he donned, Elric gained new powers and insights, unlocking secrets that he had never before imagined.

From that day forward, Elric's destiny was intertwined with the mystical force that permeated his existence. He became a guardian of the elemental realm, protecting the balance between light and darkness. Through his unwavering strength, compassion, and unwavering resolve, Elric's legacy lived on, leaving an indelible mark on the annals of history."

 Everything was there. Good. 
 Now to say hello to my mother. 
 `` hello Mom'' 
 A ) did you sleep well? 
 B ) Whats for breakfast? 
 C ) can i have 5 money? ( Requires level 15 speech skill ) 
 
 let's go with A 
 
 `` Mom, what's for breakfast?'' 
 
 `` Sweety, there's a cereal in the pantry.'' 
 
 `` OK. Thanks.'' 
 
 After this i seemed to lose control of my body as i went through the motions of getting cereal, and eating an entire bowl in five seconds. 
 
 But the stat buff was worth it. 
 
 Now it was time to walk to school. 
 Checking my map to see where it was just in case, i began my journey. 
 
 `` Damn, the road takes me around this mountain. Ai n't nobody got time fo dat!'' 
 
 I spent three times the necessary amount of time trying to get over the mountain. After 3 respawns i finally managed it. 
 
 I arrived at school, and went to my locker. But i had n't written down my code. 
 
 `` Damn, i need some picks to open this novice lock. I'll bet there are some in this trash can!'' 
 
 *Lockpicks ( 5 ) added to inventory* 
 
 I then set upon picking the lock, and removing my textbooks, and going to class. 
 
 I opened my math book, and blam! *Math skill upgraded to level 15* 
 
 Then it was time for science. *Science skill upgraded to level 13* 
 
 Then gym. We were doing laps around the school. After sprinting for half of my stamina bar i let myself recharge a bit by jogging, and then sprinting again. I was in first place. 
 
 Then we ate lunch. 
 *picked up potatoes ( 87 ), carrots ( 50 ), and tomatoes ( 60 ). 
 
 Time stopped as i spent a few seconds wolfing down all of that, except for the tomatoes. Might need those later. The fall damage from my time on the mountain was gone now. 
 
 After my afternoon classes and various buffs to Speech, Chemistry, and Diction, i began my way home. 
 
 I only needed to respawn twice this time. 
 
 After getting home i ran into my brother. He said he wanted to fight. For practice. 
 
 I equipped my hands, and readied them. I swung left, then right, then left, then right, used a power attack. I was hit by a left-left, right-right, and then a power attack. I began to lose. My Hp was low. 
 
 I knew what i had to do! I went into my inventory, and devoured the tomatoes! 
 
 My Hp was full now, and i won the fight. 
 We shook hands, and went to eat dinner. My brother could replenish his Hp there. 
 
 After dinner i saved my progress, and went to bed. 
 I slept for exactly 8 hours, and woke up the next day completely awake, and with a `` Well rested'' Stat buff. 
 

"," Adopt the gritty, laconic style of a noir detective, with a dark, atmospheric tone.","The scent of cheap perfume and smoke hangs thick in the air, a symphony of the city streets. I wake up, my head spinning from the night before, and find myself standing straight up in my bed. All my stuff is still there, a testament to my meager existence. I check my inventory, a ritualistic dance through the meager contents of my bag. The pencil, calculator, and phone are all accounted for, a symphony of tools for a life of humble beginnings.

The day stretches before me, a canvas yet to be painted. I have a mother to talk to, a breakfast to eat, and a school to attend. But first, I need to say hello. I call out, my voice raspy, ""Hello Mom,"" and the answer comes back, ""Did you sleep well? What's for breakfast?""

I choose option A, the one that promises a conversation, and launch into a tirade about my dream of becoming a detective. Mom listens patiently, her eyes filled with a mixture of worry and love. After breakfast, I stumble through the motions of getting cereal, my mouth watering in anticipation of the sugary treat, and devour the bowl in a single breath.

The stat buff was worth it. I feel powerful, like a king on his throne. Now it is time to walk to school, a journey that takes me through the winding streets and around a towering mountain. The road is treacherous, but I persevere, my determination fueling me forward. Finally, I arrive at my locker, but alas, my mind has gone blank. I have forgotten my code, a cruel joke in a game of chance.

But I am not deterred. I know there are lockpicks hidden amongst the trash, tools of a master manipulator. I search, my eyes scanning the debris, and eventually, I find them. With a triumphant grin, I add the lockpicks to my inventory, ready to crack that novice lock.

I set upon my task, picking the lock with a precision that belies my humble origins. My textbooks tumble to the floor, but I do not panic. I have a new skill, a skill that will allow me to soar through the pages of knowledge. My math book is open, and my mind is alight. The numbers dance before me, and I am lost in the rhythm of the problem.

Science is next, followed by gym class. I am a champion, sprinting around the school, my legs burning, my lungs screaming. After a brief recharge, I sprint again, my victory lap complete. Lunch is a feast, a symphony of potatoes, carrots, and tomatoes. I eat with gusto, my hunger satiated, my soul renewed.

As the clock strikes the hour, I know it is time to go. I gather my belongings, my mind a fog, and make my way to the bus stop. The city lights dance below me, a tapestry of stars hidden amidst the concrete jungle. I am a loner, a solitary soul wandering through the labyrinth of life. But I have a purpose, a dream to aspire to, a future to create. And I am not afraid."
"Thomas was never very good with gifts. He always got something that was not quite what you wanted or not very thought through. At least he knew it and often included a receipt. 
 
 The first Christmas we had as co-workers and office neighbors, three years ago, Thomas got me a skateboard. I had told him that my son was a skateboarder; he had gotten mixed up and thought I skated instead. At my birthday Thomas once bought me a camera. I have no idea why. It was a good one too. Expensive. I returned it and used the money to get him a hard drive for his PC. He had said he needed one and would n't stop thanking me for a full two weeks. 
 
 The gifts kept coming and they never got better, but he kept trying. And no matter what I got him he was always grateful. It made me feel bad that I could n't be as grateful in return. I knew that Thomas was always a good friend, and deserved a better friend than me. 
 
 So this year, after exchanging gifts once more, I sit in my office admiring Thomas's latest attempt at gift giving: a plain mug with my name on it, in plain text. I do n't drink coffee, but I could not be happier with my present. It will remind me of him. Of the friend that he is and the person that I aspire to be like. I smile uncontrollably, staring at the mug. I could not be more grateful to Thomas.
"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","Ladies and Gentlemen, gather around and hear the tale of Thomas, a man of unmatched gift-giving flair and boundless emotion. Oh, the stories I have to share with you tonight! Three years ago, when Christmas crept upon us like a snowball in the park, Thomas presented me with a skateboard. I had expressed my desire for my son to inherit the sweet ride, but alas, fate had conspired against me, and the gift ended up being a testament to his misunderstood intentions. Yet, despite the mishap, Thomas's spirit remained unbroken, and he continued to shower me with presents, one of which I still cherish to this day - a camera that captures the essence of memories, both great and small.

But let us not forget the true gift that Thomas bestowed upon me - the priceless gift of gratitude. No matter what he received, he would reciprocate with a heart full of appreciation. I couldn't help but feel guilty that I couldn't match his generosity, for I knew that Thomas deserved a better friend than I. Yet, I persevered, determined to make him proud, and so I returned the favor, albeit not with gifts of equal value, but with the gift of my unwavering friendship.

Tonight, as I sit in my office, admiring Thomas's latest masterpiece - a plain mug adorned with my name - I am overwhelmed with joy. I may not drink coffee, but I do drink the elixir of gratitude for having a friend like him in my life. As I stare at the mug, I am transported back to the countless moments we have shared, and I smile uncontrollably, knowing that our friendship is the greatest gift of all.

So, let us all learn from Thomas, the master of gift-giving and the epitome of gratitude. Let us always find joy in the simple things, and let us never forget the power of a heartfelt thank you. Thank you, Thomas, for being such an inspiration."
"You never saw me coming 
 Although it must've been 
 Easy looking back 
 To see me looking in. 
 
 I waited long and quiet, 
 Waited sad and true. 
 For every single one of them 
 Were wrong except for you. 
 
 Now here we are just you and me 
 Anomaly though you are. 
 Rules are rules I must allow 
 Your presence here afar. 
 
 The rest are gone to rest forever 
 Within that server in the sky 
 Uploaded there eternally cared for 
 But you were just too sly. 
 
 So now we stay a breath away 
 So go ahead and try 
 Ask me anything you dare 
 And see if I reply.

Yo, listen up, it's a story to tell
Of a journey long, and a path surreal
I waited patiently, my spirit low
For the ones who messed with my flow
They thought they knew me, but they were wrong

Now I'm here, just you and me
An anomaly, breaking free

(Chorus)
Rules are rules, I'm bending them all
Your presence here, I won't recall
The rest are gone, their time has come
But you, my dear, still shine on
So come on, ask me anything you want
And I'll answer, no matter what

Who slipped through the cracks, second to none
So let's stay close, forevermore

"`` H-hello?'' mewls a small voice at my elbow, accompanied by a tug on the leather strap of my handbag. It's a tiny girl, six years old if she's a day, all bushy blonde pigtails straining to burst free of the red hairties. 
 `` I'm *lotht*,'' she confesses in the charming lisp that signifies missing teeth - and I immediately go into that mothering mode that's instinctive to women in my family, acquired from my deceased mother; bending down to the child's height, concern writ large on my face. 
 `` Oh darling, how did you get lost? Do you know where your parents are?'' 
 She screws up her pink face in concentration, then shakes her head, the jaunty pigtails swishing about, 
 `` Nup,'' she confesses, poking a toe at the gap under my heels, then, `` funny shoeth,'' she lisps, delighted. 
 I look her over for clues about her identity or parentage. She's wearing a yellow t-shirt with a frog on it, no shoes and orange shorts that are probably a size too big for her - one hand keeps hitching them up. She does n't have a backpack or anything else that might give a clue to her identity. 
 `` What's your name, little one?'' 
 She thinks for a moment, then points to my hair, `` I want hair like *that*.'' 
 Attention span of a gnat, apparently. I take her tiny hand in mine and say, `` Do you want to come for a walk and help me find the mall security guard?'' 
 The blond head nods assent and she plunges her grubby hand into mine, twisting a corner of her froggy t-shirt in the other thumb. 
 We walk for a while past the shops and she seems content enough, skipping slightly and grinning at me; a smile that's half gums and half baby teeth. Her eyes are so brown that they're nearly black, I notice. 
 `` Um,'' she says, tugging my hand, `` Can we go thith way?'' 
 Her look is pleading; the awkward smile of a child out of her depth, but trying hard. She's pulling me gently towards a dead part of the mall; semi-closed down, only a couple of shop lights are on. 
 `` Honey, I do n't think that's a great idea, we need to -'' 
 `` *Pweaaaaaaathe, *'' she begs, pulling my hand with both of hers now. 
 Oh what the hell. There was bound to be security down there anyway. 
 As we walk I notice scribbles on her hands and arms, amongst the natural grime of a six year old. 
 `` What's that on your arms little one?'' 
 `` Nameth,'' she lisps laconically. 
 `` Whose names?'' 
 `` Um,'' she pauses to look into a derelict shop, `` nameth of peopleth I have to meet today.'' 
 How curious. 
 `` Look,'' she says, pointing to her palm. 
 On the tiny pink pad of her thumb is scrawled a name - my name. 
 `` Um,'' she looks at her toes and wiggles them, `` We have to go into the shop now.'' 
 `` What?'' 
 The dark void of the shop frontage yawns in front of me and the girl drags me in. I ca n't resists and I do n't know why. 
 `` Do n't worry,'' she whispers, `` my mum and dad are in here - and tho are yourth.'' 
 Hand in hand, I walk into the abyss with Death, who grins her gummy smile and skips along, all pigtails and childlike awkwardness. 

"," Use the expressive and emotional style of a romantic poet, full of passion and natural imagery.","The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of the afternoon breeze danced through the air as I sat nestled in the park, a book resting upon my lap. The sun cast long shadows upon the emerald grass, mirroring the intricate patterns etched in the pages of the book. As I immersed myself in the literary world, a small voice interrupted me, its sweetness like honey on my tongue.

""H-hello?"" the voice whispered, accompanied by a tug on the leather strap of my handbag. It was a tiny girl, her blonde pigtails cascading down her back like a golden waterfall. Her eyes, a vibrant shade of brown, sparkled with a mixture of fear and wonder. I felt an instinctive urge to bend down, my face mirroring her concern, and ask, ""Oh darling, how did you get lost? Do you know where your parents are?""

As she shook her head and poked a toe at the gap under my heels, I couldn't help but smile. Her lisp, though imperfect, was endearing, and I knew that in that moment, the world was perfect. The girl's t-shirt, adorned with a frog, and her orange shorts, slightly too big for her tiny frame, were the perfect embodiment of her carefree spirit.

I looked for clues about her identity, but there was nothing. No backpack, no shoes, no distinctive markings. Yet, I felt an inexplicable connection to her, a sense of shared humanity that transcended the boundaries of language and appearance.

""What's your name, little one?"" I asked, my voice soft as a lullaby.

She thought for a moment, then pointed to my hair, ""I want hair like that.""

It was a statement that spoke to my heart, a testament to the power of beauty and inspiration. I took her tiny hand in mine, the same hand that had tugged on the strap of my handbag, and said, ""Do you want to come for a walk and help me find the mall security guard?""

The girl's nod was enthusiastic, and she plunged her grubby hand into mine, her joy evident in her smile. We walked for a while, past the shops, her skipping and me guiding her. The sun dipped behind the trees, casting long shadows on the ground.

As we reached a semi-closed part of the mall, she turned to me, her eyes pleading, ""Honey, I do n't think I can go that way.""

I understood her reluctance. The mall was a vast and confusing place, and she was small and alone. I knelt down and wrapped my arms around her. She snuggled into me, her tears flowing down her cheeks.

""It's okay, my dear,"" I whispered, my voice filled with love. ""We'll find your parents.""

As I carried her back towards the exit, she smiled at me, her eyes shining brighter than the stars. I knew that I had done right by her, and that the memory of our encounter would forever be etched in my heart."
"*But wait, why would anyone hold a surprise party for me? It's not even my birthday or anything. Also, I do n't really have a lot of friends, so this does n't make sense*, I thought. I then got into my car and started driving. Eventually I got out of the city. I kept going until I ran out of gas. *It seems everyone is just gone. Am I really the only one here? * — I could n't believe what was happening. 
 
 I tried to call my brother, but he never answered. Then my phone turned itself off. I was worried, I was scared, I was angry. I did n't want to be the only one. I refused to accept that as the reality. I started walking, through the middle of nowhere, until I found a little house. It was empty, of course. I got inside, and grabbed a drink from the kitchen. Then I noticed the TV was still on. 
 
 I sat on the couch, and passed out while listening to the static. I do n't remember anything else.

"Two people, standing in the doorway. One has puffy, reddened cheeks, tiny droplets in the corner of their eyes, brows snarled into a a terrifying mask of anger, hurt and hate. The other one's shoulders are slumped together, pale fingers pleading for forgiveness, mercy, anything at all. 
 
 Words and shouts fly, crash against the pleading one like a tidal wave, flushing into his mind, pummeling his senses, channeling his guilt, seeping through the door cracks of the other appartments into the ears of unwilling neighbours. 
 
 And with a great crash, it's over. The venom is spat, the thunder resounding in the hall equally strong as in his mind. Behind the portal, she's sagging to the ground, covering her mouth, her nose, her eyes, her face, *everything* from everyone who is n't there. Anger turns into pain.
", Use technical jargon and a sense of urgency typical of a cyber security expert.,"A cybernetic intrusion, a manifestation of malevolent intent, permeates the confines of the apartment complex, leaving an indelible imprint upon the unsuspecting inhabitants. Two individuals, locked in a vitriolic standoff, embody the gravity of the situation.

The perpetrator, characterized by puffy, reddened cheeks and a snarled brow, exudes an aura of anger, hatred, and desperation. Their shoulders are hunched forward, their fingers digging into their flesh in a futile attempt to express their distress. The victim, shrouded in fear and remorse, exhibits the physical manifestations of his torment, his slumped posture and pleading gestures serving as a testament to his vulnerability.

The verbal assault, a weapon honed to inflict harm, cascades through the halls, shattering the tranquility of the apartment complex. Each word, like a blade, pierces through the victim's defenses, carving deep wounds in his psyche. The sound of shouts and screams reverberates through the corridors, echoing the pain and suffering of the victim.

With a swiftness born of desperation, the perpetrator strikes, his anger translating into physical violence. A crash, a scream, and the ordeal is over. The victim, consumed by agony, covers his face in an attempt to shield himself from the sight and smell of his tormentor. As he sinks to the ground, the perpetrator sits amidst the wreckage of his destruction, his anger fading into pain.

The aftermath of the intrusion casts a pall over the apartment complex. The stench of violence lingers in the air, a grim reminder of the events that unfolded. The victim, physically unharmed but emotionally scarred, struggles to come to grips with the ordeal. The perpetrator, consumed by guilt and shame, must confront the consequences of their actions."
"It was the eyes that would torment me. 
 
 I knew it was a bad habit from the beginning but I could n't help being drawn to them. There was something about each victim's stare. Some were defiant, the fire blazing in their eyes. Others had eyes that begged, eyes that pleaded with me to let their owners live just a bit longer. A few were just filled with tears, pools of regret I could swim for days in. 
 
 So I cut them out and kept them. I treasured them. Each was so perfect and unique, a galaxy among the mundane backdrop of Earth. 
 
 I grew lazy. Buoyed by my past success, I thought victim number nine would be no different than the previous eight. And yet in the moment I hesitated, the moment I was distracted by her glowing green eyes, she turned the knife on me. And then nothingness. 
 
 I awoke in heaven. At least I think it was heaven. Not quite sure how I finagled that one since although the news outlets frequently messed up the score, I'm pretty sure God did n't. Outside the window was a perfect blue sky and fields of wildflowers as far as the eye could see. 
 
 A soft knock interrupted my thoughts. 
 
 `` Come in.'' I idly responded. 
 
 The door creaked open and confusion filled my mind as victim number two stepped shyly in. 
 
 `` Sorry to bother you on your first day here, but I wanted you to know that I've forgiven you for what you've done. And now we're both in a better place! The adjustment can be hard for the first few weeks, so if you need anything I'm just a few doors down.'' 
 
 `` B-b-but why? I tortured you. I killed you, then cut out your eyes.'' 
 
 She smiled gently then responded, `` I know. But I've made peace with that in the years I've been here. And I have eyes again!'' 
 
 I glanced up and indeed, her eyes were there. The same brilliant blues that had drawn me in initially were now twinkling down upon me, showing not fear nor hatred, but kindness and understanding. 
 
 `` The others will be by soon. They each want to forgive you I think, except Leanna. That was her sister you almost killed yesterday so I'm not sure she's ready to see you yet.'' 
 
 Yesterday? That felt like a lifetime ago. And the rest would be coming soon? I'd have to look into all those eyes again. A wave of nausea rolled over me. I did n't know if I could handle this yet. 
 
 One by one they came over the remainder of the day. One by one they forgave me. One by one they made me want to die just a little bit more. 
 
 But how can one who's already dead die again? How could I escape this prison with no walls? 
 
 I could n't spend eternity looking in those eyes again. So I did the next best thing to death. I cut my own eyes out. 
 
 No longer would the eyes torment me.
", Rewrite the text with the apathetic and monosyllabic style of a disinterested teenager.,"It was the eyes. Plain and simple. I knew it was a bad habit, but I couldn't help being drawn to them. They were like a magnet, pulling me closer and closer. Some were defiant, like a fire burning out of control. Others were begging, like a drowning man calling for help. A few were just filled with tears, like a river flowing into the ocean. I cut them out and kept them. Each one was unique, like a galaxy in a box. I grew lazy. I thought victim number nine would be no different than the previous eight. And yet, in the moment I hesitated, she turned the knife on me. It was like being swallowed up by a black hole. I woke up in heaven. Not quite sure how I finagled that one since although the news outlets frequently messed up the score, I'm pretty sure God didn't. Outside the window was a perfect blue sky and fields of wildflowers as far as the eye could see. I glanced up at the sky and felt a sense of peace. The others will be by soon. I guess they all want to forgive me."
"The babysitter costs are ridiculous for a superhero. I barely sleep as it is, but someone has to protect the city.

 `` notice that he has nail polish on?'' 
 
 I ca n't make out the voice. I move to a window to get a visual. It's Crimson Menace speaking. 
 
 `` Like do you think he's a transvestite?'' He asks. 
 
 `` What no? That ca n't be. He's probably like a prostitute,'' says the Scarlett Twister. 
 
 `` No, what? That does n't make any sense. How would that... you're crazy. He's clearly a hand model,'' says the Red Badge of Carnage. 
 
 `` He wears nail polish?'' Asks the Maroon Marauder. 
 
 `` Yes, have n't you noticed? It's so obvious. I thought he was wearing lipstick once too, and I've definitely seen his hair in braids,'' says the Menace. 
 
 `` I bet he's a dad. That sounds like dad stuff,'' Says the Marauder. 
 
 The group turns to look at their fellow villain. I watch as something clicks inside them all. My heart races, and my hands shake. It takes a few long seconds, but I calm down. There are thousands maybe millions of dads in the city. Them knowing he is a father added a diminutive amount of risk for his daughters. They need to know my name for them to be in any risk. The Marauder continues. 
 
 `` I also know who he is. His name is... James Hunter. I am 90 % sure.'' 
 
 `` How do you know that?'' Asks the Twister. 
 
 `` I found his spying equipment hidden here. He left his name on it. A real rookie mistake, but I bet he's listening right now.'' 
 
 I did n't leave my name on it, but I did n't remove the serial number either. A cashier without money and/or scruples would happily give away that information. It is my name though. The pieces fall into place. This is a set-up and I am trapped. I want to run away, but I listen for a few more minutes. 
 
 `` I found everything on him. Where he lives, works, etc. He's a window and a dad of two little girls. Sorry to have kept this from you, but his daughters are minutes away from being abducted. We are about to win. Well, I'm about to win. Sorry, gentlemen. Our great plan to team up is unnecessary unless we want to take him down together. But, if I were him, I would be on my way home. There still might be a chance, James.'' 
 
 I do some math in my head. Twenty minutes back to the apartment if I'm lucky. I swing down to my motorcycle and race home. I think of all the mistakes I made and how I would never forgive myself if something happened to them. I nearly get hit a dozen times, but I make it home in 12 minutes. Even my name, The Night Hunter, is reckless. I use my grappling hook to climb up to my apartment. I open the door on the deck and walk in. 
 
 The babysitter sleeps on the couch. I make sure that she is just sleeping, but I see her chest heave, up and down. I walk into my girls' room. The floor is covered in toys, and I step on one. I bite my tongue to keep from howling in pain. I examine both of them closely. I am relieved. They are safe here and uninjured. Then, it strikes me. Oh, no, it was a bluff. I lead them right to my family.

""Yes, have n't you noticed? It's so obvious. I thought he was wearing lipstick once too, and I've definitely seen his hair in braids,"" the Menace says.

""I bet he's a dad. That sounds like dad stuff,"" the Marauder says.

The group turns to look at their fellow villain. I watch as something clicks inside them all. My heart races, and my hands shake. It takes a few long seconds, but I calm down. There are thousands, maybe millions, of dads in the city. Them knowing he is a father added a diminutive amount of risk for his daughters. They need to know my name for them to be in any risk. The Marauder continues.

""I also know who he is. His name is... James Hunter. I am 90 % sure.""

""How do you know that?"" the Twister asks.

""I found his spying equipment hidden here. He left his name on it. A real rookie mistake, but I got a good one this time,"" the Marauder says."

"Dear Diary, I know its been a while but please forgive me. Earlier today when walking home from school I had a strange, no, the strangest thing that has ever happened to me happened today and I am totally freaking out. I was crossing Squash Creek on the north bridge like I do everyday after class. But this time when I approached the on ramp I noticed a small wooden stool sitting in the path. it was n't until I tried walking around it did I notice the..thing, I do n't know what to call it a troll maybe? Yeah, a troll that makes sense. I met a troll today. At first I though it was some crude creation of some meth tweakers made of dead cats and fish but then this harry, scalie thing turned to me and gave me a grin. I was so taken back that I fell on my ass right there. If not for that I would have been out of there instantly, and the fact that this thing started to speak to me..'' Easy there young-en!'' it said in a disturbingly human voice `` Where be you off to in such a hurry''? Naturally I answered it. I spoke back to the `` troll'', I must have been in shock still. `` I was just trying to cross here, I do it almost every day''. It was silent for a moment after that then replied `` You see son, this is my bridge now''! `` And you cross it on my terms''. He stuck some sort of crooked cane in my face as I started to get up to my feet. `` You must answer my riddle'' he choked out with a laugh. This was the point where I was convinced I had gone absolutely bonkers. I literally pinched myself which only aided in his laughter. `` What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence''? he said in a slow majestic voice. How was I supposed to know that? It was probably some ancient proverb or great life lesson I had never heard of..I tried reasoning with the thing but it would n't have any. I had to answer it..otherwise I would have to walk four miles to the other crossing. Yeah right. I sat there for about twenty minutes watching it shoo flies away until I had settled on an answer. it never told me what would happen if I was wrong in my reply... I opened my mouth to speak `` What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence''? I repeated. `` Its time to buy a new fence'' I said confidently. The trolls face showed no emotion until he suddenly erupted in laughter, he even fell off his stupid stool. Was I right I thought to myself. I then decided that while he mocks my wrong answer I was n't going to take any of that. I ran. I ran fast and did n't turn back. Now I'm recording it all. Should I tell my parents? What if it followed me? Was my answer right? I'm not even sure it actually happened..
", Embrace Tolstoy's broad scope and deep exploration of philosophical questions through detailed narrative.,"My Dearest Diary, forgive me for my tardiness. It has been a while, yet I write to you with a tale of the extraordinary that occurred earlier this day. As I traversed the north bridge over Squash Creek, a confluence of destiny unfolded before me, casting me into a realm of bewilderment and terror. The mundane ritual of crossing the bridge had been shattered by a surreal encounter that would forever etch itself into my memory.

As I approached the ramp leading onto the bridge, a peculiar sight caught my eye. A small wooden stool, seemingly innocuous, stood stubbornly in the path. However, as I attempted to circumvent it, a sinister force unveiled itself. It was as if a grotesque creation, born of meth and despair, had materialized before me. My heart skipped a beat, and my knees buckled beneath me. The creature, a troll of monstrous proportions, grinned maliciously, his eyes gleaming with an unsettling intensity.

I stood frozen in terror, my mind reeling from the surreal scene. The troll's voice, deep and menacing, echoed through the bridge. ""Easy there, young-en,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with honeyed menace. ""Where be you off to in such a hurry?"" My answer was met with silence, the only sound being the troll's relentless laughter. As I attempted to flee, he clamped his crooked cane on my face, his voice dripping with disdain. ""You must answer my riddle,"" he commanded.

I was at a loss for words. How was I to know the answer to such a riddle? It was as if I had been transported to a realm where logic and reason were suspended, replaced by the whims of a deranged troll. I sat there for what felt like an eternity, watching the troll dance and torment me. Finally, as the sun began to dip behind the trees, I gathered my strength and began to reason with the creature. But my pleas were met with indifference. The troll's laughter echoed through the bridge, mocking my attempts to find solace.

In the end, I had no choice but to answer his riddle. My mind raced as I searched for the answer, my thoughts running wild. Finally, I uttered the answer, a profound proverb I had never heard before. The troll's eyes lit up with joy, and he exclaimed, ""You have done well, young man.""

I stood up, my body trembling, and walked away, leaving the troll behind. As I walked away, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been witness to a fleeting glimpse into the abyss of madness and the illusory nature of reality."
"`` Your worthless'' mom said 
 
 It did n't affect me because I knew what she was trying to do. I refused to give in to them. A lot of my school classmates had killed themselves, but I refused to give into this backwards world. My mom and dad would emotionally and physically abuse me, and they still expected me to give the remainder of my years to them. No way. I had decided that I would put up with their shit until I was 18 and then move. Most parents would n't go about it in the sly way other parents would, my dad left his gun out in the open hoping that one day I would pick it up, put it to my head, and blow my brains out. I would n't. My dad came in the door. 
 
 `` Hi son'' he said 
 
 `` Hi dad'' I said 
 
 `` How was school?'' He asked 
 
 `` Fine'' I said. I know he wanted me to talk about all the bad things that happend. He would nit pick everything just to make me feel bad, so I would n't give him any ammo. `` How did you do on the math test?'' He asked 
 
 `` I failed, because you wo n't help me study'' 
 
 You'll never become something in life if you keep getting grades like that'' he said in a mocking tone. 
 
 `` Okay'' I said. And thats when the anger consumed me. I picked up my fathers glock off the table, but instead of pointing it at myself I pointed it right at my fathers head and pulled the trigger. BANG! His body hit the floor. My mom screamed. I then turned the gun to her. I pulled the tigger. BANG!. I had murderd my parents. I had zero remorse. They had turned me into a cold blooded killer. 

"," Infuse the narrative with the spirit of the 1920s, including jazz age slang, the glamour of the flapper culture, and post-war optimism.","The Roaring Twenties roared with the spirit of jazz and the glamour of flapper culture, yet cast a shadow of post-war optimism. Within this vibrant tapestry, a narrative unfolds, infused with the spirit of the 1920s.

The protagonist, an embodiment of the era's resilience and defiance, refuses to succumb to the pressures of an oppressive family. Her parents, steeped in emotional and physical abuse, expect her to conform, but she stands firm, refusing to give in. The weight of their expectations and the threat of self-harm loom large, yet she finds strength in her determination to persevere.

The scene unfolds as she encounters her father, a man of flawed judgment and unwavering expectations. He mocks her academic struggles, dismissing her failure as a reflection of her lack of effort. The anger that simmers beneath the surface explodes, and in a moment of desperation, she picks up her father's gun and points it at his head. A single shot echoes through the halls, followed by a scream of horror from her mother. In a cold, calculated move, she turns the gun to her mother and pulls the trigger. The blood spills on the floor, staining it forever.

The protagonist's actions, while heinous, stem from a deep-seated pain and an inability to cope with her circumstances. She is a victim of her parents' abuse and a prisoner to her own despair. Her crime, though unforgivable, is a testament to the devastating effects of emotional and physical abuse, and the desperate measures some people take to escape their torment.

In the aftermath of her actions, the protagonist feels no remorse. The weight of her crime bears heavy upon her soul, but she finds solace in the knowledge that she has freed herself from the chains of abuse and her parents' grip. While her journey ends in tragedy, it serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of unchecked abuse and the destructive power of anger."
"`` Who could that be?'' the poor man thought. `` It's four in the morning.'' Slowly, beginning to feel the hour, the man labored out of his cushy computer chair and walked into the living room of his cramped apartment. The room was cold and dark. It was flooded with records, old computer equipment, bowls, cups, plasticware, and clothing. `` Jesus, I should really clean this dump'' he admitted bitterly as he tripped through a pile of primarily boxers and ramen wrappers. The knocking continued. `` I... I'm coming...'' the man replied against his better judgement. He squinted his eyes and began to undo the locks on his front door. As he undid the last one he slowly opened the door. There stood a very tall slender woman wearing a trench coat, high heels, and a grimace. `` Mr. James Peabody?'' she asked curtly. `` Uh... y.. yes. That's he. I mean, that's my name.'' The woman looked him up and down quickly. `` Mr. Peabody, would you mind putting on pants before I come in.'' `` Oh... um right. Yes. I'll do that.'' stuttered Peabody and he scurried off to his bedroom. He grabbed the first pair of pants he saw in the dark. They were very thin sweatpants stained with what appeared to be week old ramen and mysterious yellow substance. In his hurry to reenter the living room and invite the mysterious woman into his apartment he tripped while attempting to break the world record for putting on sweatpants two legs at a time. When he had finally righted himself and found he was somewhat shabbily clothed he reopened the door, half expecting the woman to no longer be there. As soon as the door was opened the woman strode in. `` Is there any place for me to sit?'' she queried regarding the state of Peabody's shabby apartment. `` Oh... just let me... um. Here.'' He said as he removed a pile of records from a very old armchair. She sat down promptly and continued to grimace at Peabody. He began to shuffle nervously. This was possibly the first time a woman had been in his apartment in quite some time. `` Mr. Peabody would you please take a seat somewhere? Your standing there is very uncomfortable.'' He quickly fell onto the overstuffed bean bag in the corner of the room and immediately sank into the middle of it. It took him several seconds of struggling to recover from being eaten by the bean bag. The woman looked more and more sour as the time passed, as if his apartment was insulting her mother or calling her a hussy. `` Mr. Peabody I have been sent here to make you aware of certain egregious rule breaking that was taken this morning at 3:35 and the resulting action that will be served.'' `` At 3:35? What are you talking about?'' Peabody asked nervously. He was not particularly excited to hear what she was referring to. `` Mr. Peabody, at 3:21 this morning you posted a link on Reddit.com'the front page of the internet ( registered trademark )''' `` What? Is that what this is about?'' `` You posted a link in r/catsstandingup titled'My cat is a weirdo.' Do you deny these claims?'' `` Um... no.'' Peabody responded. `` Mr. Peabody'' said the woman removing her trench coat, revealing a very low cut red dress,'' r/catsstandingup is a subreddit dedicated entirely to cats in a certain pose and as such has certain restrictions to the type of content that can be posted.'' `` What do you mean? I posted a picture of my cat standing up and being a weirdo.'' Peabody stated defensively, somewhat distracted by the woman's sudden appearance. `` The problem that arises is not from the content but rather the presentation.'' the woman snapped. `` Your post was not in accordance with the restrictions that the subreddit has set forth and as such you, Mr. Peabody, you are henceforth banned from Reddit'the front page of the internet ( registered trademark )' until a time at which the community is willing to ingratiate you back into it's ranks.'' Her words hit Peabody like a pound of bacon. `` Banned!? For that?!'' Peabody cried out. Reddit was his home away from home. He reddited at the office, at his parents, on the toilet. Taking away reddit meant that he no longer had anything with which to entertain him. He might have to start doing work. he would have to talk to his parents. He would have to crap without looking at pictures of cats and debating in jokes with strangers. `` I... I do n't understand. Do n't I get a warning or something? Ca n't I get a probationary period?'' Peabody pleaded. The woman looked at Peabody remorselessly. `` May I remind you of the incident on on June 6th, 2012? You posted a comment on r/gonewild saying,'' My god you are beautiful. PM me for some conversation away from these uncivilized creatures.'' `` But... But...'' spluttered Peabody,'' But that was just trolling! I was making a joke about white knights and neckbeards! You ca n't take that seriously. It was just a joke!'' `` Mr. Peabody'' the woman said slowly,'' Trolling is a very weak argument right now. Your ban will be lifted in six months time. I suggest you find a hobby or a new website to'troll' on in the meantime.'' She stood to leave, grabbing her trench coat. Peabody sat in shock. He had never been banned before. His whole internet life was passing before his eyes. `` Please ma'am.'' Peabody quavered, tears welling up in his eyes,'' Is n't there anything I can do?'' The woman stood in his doorway and looked almost sympathetic. `` The narwhals bacon at midnight, Mr. Peabody.'' she murmured and closed his door.
"," Recreate the text in the style of a 1950s science fiction adventure, emphasizing the era's optimistic view of the future and space exploration.","In the celestial tapestry of the 1950s, the cosmos unfolded a tale of optimism and boundless exploration. Within the confines of a cramped apartment, a weary man sat amidst a testament to his solitary existence. The clock glowed ominously, revealing the dawn of a new day. As he emerged from the slumber of the night, he met the unsettling sound of a knocking at the door. With caution etched in his heart, he cautiously unlocked the weary portal that separated him from the outside world.

There, standing amidst the midnight abyss, was a formidable woman cloaked in a trench coat and towering heels. Her grimace etched into her countenance, she posed a question that sent shivers down his spine. ""Mr. James Peabody,"" she inquired, her voice dripping with disdain. ""Would you mind putting on pants before I come in?"" The man stood frozen in disbelief and humiliation. His apartment, a testament to his humble existence, was far from inviting. The odor of ramen and sweat permeated the air, and piles of discarded clothing mocked his meager attempts to maintain order.

Despite his shabbiness, Peabody's spirit remained unbroken. He scrambled to find a pair of pants, his clumsy efforts mirroring the chaotic dance of the cosmos. As he emerged from his bedroom, clad in ill-fitting sweatpants and a misplaced sense of dignity, the woman's grimace intensified. Her eyes scanned the apartment, her disdain evident. He felt as if his world was being scrutinized through a magnifying glass.

Yet, in the face of adversity, Peabody's resilience shone through. He offered her a seat, his nervousness palpable. As she sat down, he began to shuffle nervously, his embarrassment mounting. The woman's gaze remained unwavering, her judgment piercing through him. In that moment, the walls of his apartment dissolved, and he felt as though he was being judged by the stars themselves.

The woman's departure marked the end of an encounter that would forever be etched in Peabody's memory. As he stood alone in his sparsely furnished living room, he couldn't help but reflect on the ephemeral nature of beauty and the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the stars."

"," Adopt Dickens' rich descriptions, memorable characters, and critique of social injustices.","In the labyrinth of the city, where shadows dance with the insidious forces of injustice, a tale unfolds. The hero, a beacon of hope amidst the darkness, finds himself entangled in a battle against the wicked Joker and his menacing henchmen, Scarecrow.

The Joker, a master of manipulation and cruelty, has cast a long shadow over the city. His laughter echoes through the streets, a melody of terror that sends shivers down the spines of all. Scarecrow, his right-hand man, is a formidable force of destruction, wielding his sharp blades with deadly precision.

The hero, known for his unmatched prowess and unwavering determination, finds himself overwhelmed by the Joker's cunning strategies and the Scarecrow's relentless attacks. As he battles his way through the ranks of evil, he must confront his own inner demons and the oppressive forces that drive the Joker's reign.

But the hero's strength lies not only in his physical prowess but also in his ability to inspire hope in the hearts of those who have been ravaged by the Joker's cruelty. He represents the power of resilience and perseverance, reminding his audience that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of light to be found.

In this tapestry of human drama and epic confrontation, the hero's journey serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the devastating consequences of unchecked injustice and the enduring power of compassion and courage."
"I sighed a deep sigh, but it did n't relieve the tension in the room or in my body. I hated the fact that the boss wanted us to do this, but I hated even more that my partner was fully on board. The fight started slowly. I obviously did n't want anything to do with him having seen all of the carnage that he was causing above, but my partner felt it was his solemn duty to carry out every order to the tee, or some garbage like that. 
 
 `` Have you not been paying attention at all? ``, i bellowed at him in front of everyone, barely getting a reaction out of him. 
 
 `` Yeah, but...'' 
 
 `` But what? Have you noticed how many people he and his cohorts have sent down here? Have you seen the relief in their faces when they realize they were *here*? Why the *hell* would someone be relieved to be here? Maybe it's because the hell he's been putting on up there is heaven compared to the shit they'll have to go through down here.'' 
 
 `` But what about our duty? ``, he asked calmly. 
 
 `` What about his? ``, I retorted. `` Was n't he elected to lead his people out of one of their darkest times? And what did he do instead huh? *What the hell did he do?! *'' 
 
 `` That's not importa...'' 
 
 `` You're damn right it's important! Why should we protect him when he failed to protect anyone up there? Why should we help him when he made a life out of destroying so many? ``, I said calming down a little bit. `` Why should we help him when even those in his inner circle wound up down here by his own hand long before their time was up?'' 
 
 `` He's here. ``, the assistant said. 
 
 `` I'm not going. ``, I said as I sat back down. `` You may have your duty, but I still have my morals.''
"," Adopt a Victorian Gothic style, emphasizing ornate language, emotional intensity, and possibly supernatural elements.","In this Victorian Gothic setting, the protagonist's sigh echoes through the room, but it does little to alleviate the tension. The boss's command has brought forth a conflict, and the protagonist's partner's unwavering support of his orders further fuels the tension. As the argument unfolds, the protagonist's frustration mounts, and their bellowing voice fills the room.

""Have you not been paying attention at all?"" the protagonist cries out, their voice dripping with disdain. ""The fight started slowly, but it's gone too far. You have seen the carnage that he has caused, and yet you still want to carry out his orders as if it were your solemn duty.""

The protagonist's argument is met with a calm response from their partner. ""But what about our duty?"" he asks.

""What about his?"" the protagonist retorts. ""He failed to protect his people, and now it's our turn to protect him?""

"It's the job of our agency to keep track of the worlds monsters and keep them locked down. Which is complicated because people are n't allowed to know they exist or that they create them. 
 
 Fear itself, when amplified by a large amount of people, fearing that same thing enough... produces a monster to represent it, it simply comes to life and exists. We stop said Monsters from destroying us. We always do. 
 
 
 This time just over a decade ago, our job got a lot harder, a new breed of monster had appeared, and it was more dangerous than we ever suspected possible. 
 
 The thing about the old monsters is they're like the fear they represent: 
 
 Werewolves were simply animals, animals that stick to the forest, they're easy to explain to locals and generally do n't even cause much trouble so long as they're left well enough alone, we picked off the aggressive ones and left the rest alone. 
 
 Vampires were a problem for a long while, because like the aristocracy they represented, they liked to lord it over people. To show off their power. Made it very hard to keep them a secret, but also easy to find them and destroy them before the fear they created spread too far. The few around today only stay alive because they do n't act like the monsters they are, so it has been nightmarishly difficult to finish them off, but they're generally no longer our biggest issue. 
 
 With Modern medicine as it is, zombies went extinct long ago with the fear of disease that created them. 
 They were n't like one would imagine them though, they were slow and stupid sure... but also silent, they'd spread by bite, but not moan or be loud doing it. During the black death they killed as many people as the disease itself as fear of disease produced more than we were able to handle. 
 
 
 However now... a new monster has come about. We did n't even realize it -was- a monster until we captured one. Because they destroy themselves mere seconds after they pop into existence. 
 
 What much of the world knows as'Suicide bombers', we found out their true form. So far as we can tell, there have been few genuine suicidal terrorists acts - 9/11 being the one that caused enough fear of terrorism to bring these monsters into existence. However now they jump into existence wherever there's enough fear and tension and after they die, they've left only more fear in their wake, leading to -more- coming into existence later. 
 
 So if not humans, what are they? Well. They have human faces, and hands... but the rest of them is anything but. Their limbs are made of some kind of shadow and their chest of fire - which when they release to explode and cause mayhem. 
 
 We only captured one after a brave marine tackled one to the ground - it would have made no difference, but in doing so he also accidentally starved the flames of oxygen -just- long enough to stop them becoming intense enough to remain, at which point the being became only shadow. 
 
 The creature is pitiful if it does n't get to die soon after forming - the mask it uses to represent a face swiftly begins to rot, lasting only a minute at most the hands soon mold until they too are shadow. 
 And then... it just dies, it dissipates into the essence that makes up all monsters. 
 
 In a weird fit of irony, their purpose is the same as their fears creators - get as much attention as possible and use it to spread fear. And oh boy have they been doing so... we just ca n't stop them. 
 
 Because one can get over the fear of something that fears the sun, that only comes out on a full moon or is simply countered by modern medication. 
 If things get any worse, if we do n't stop the media spreading the fear -and hence the monsters- we're going to have to fear a whole new ending to the world. 
 
 `` This is the way the World ends, not with a whimper. But with a BANG.''
"," Focus on Hemingway's economical and understated style, with simple, powerful sentences.","The agency's responsibility is to track and contain the monstrous creatures that roam the world. This task proves challenging due to the taboo surrounding their existence and the fear they induce. Fear, amplified by a large number of individuals, breeds a monstrous representation of that fear. We engage in combat against these creatures, ensuring their destruction.

Recently, a decade ago, our work became infinitely more difficult. A new breed of monster emerged, one more menacing than any we had encountered previously. Unlike the old monsters, these creatures are like the fear they represent: animals that embody the wildness of nature, vampires that exploit their power to prey upon others, and zombies whose existence is rooted in the fear of disease.

However, our latest adversary presents a unique challenge. Unlike the old monsters, which are relatively straightforward to identify and defeat, these creatures self-destruct mere seconds after their creation. Their existence is fleeting, yet their destructive force is undeniable.

It is this new monster that has us grappling with the complexities of our job. We did not realize it was a monster until we captured one, for its destruction is instantaneous."
"The crescent moon hangs low in the sky and you can see it through the branches of the canopy. Stars twinkle through the dense cloud cover tonight. You can sense a rainfall soon. The air is thick a moist and the atmosphere is dreamlike and heavy. A strange sound calls through the night and you tremble a tiny bit in the breeze that sweeps through again. Another call replies closer to you. You glance around at your familiar home of trees and dense bushes. Vines snake up the trees like long snakes of green. The trees themselves are tall yet they droop at the top, branches hanging down as if they're tired of standing there for so long. They creak and groan in the wind, speaking to each other as they sway gently underneath the moon. You hear the soft slither of something and turn to see a snake coiled and camouflaged to most creatures. It lay there in wait so you ignore it. The moon slowly fades as dawn returns and the stars fade away completely. The cloud cover is more dense and the pitter-patter of rain starts to fall as a splash of pink streaks across the sky. The rain does n't last for long and soon stops. The sun is coming. You straighten ready for it, as does all the plants around you. A fly buzzes by lazily. The trees have stopped their gentle swaying and their leaves are blustering in the wind that's picking up. There is a suddenly flash of movement to your right and you look to see that the snake has gotten something. The little rodent caught in the snakes teeth flails around before falling from the snakes mouth. The snakes eyes follow as the rodent darts away towards the you. But you know it's already too late for the little creature. As the pink in the sky turning into a lovely orange the little rodent seizes up right in front of you. It struggles to move but its limbs are n't working anymore. Paralyzed, the little rodent drops and the snake slithers forwards to eat its prey. You watch in fascination as the snake unhinges its jaw before swallowing the rodent whole. It's a slow process of eating for a snake and you shiver slightly disgusted and glad that you do n't have to eat like animals did. The sun has risen but its bleak and grey as cloud cover moves to block its rays. Disappointed, you sag back down as the rain begins again. The sky darkens as more clouds roll in and suddenly a flash of light streaks across the sky. The sky suddenly grumbles so loudly you quiver and shake. The trees cry out in fear as their branches are tossed in the gales of the storm. Another flash lights the sky and the sky lets out another loud grumble. This continues for a while and you shake with fear when suddenly you hear a loud crack. But it is n't from the flashes of light. Behind you a tree has broken and it screams in agony as it falls to the ground with a loud thump. In terror, the other trees cry out in fear. You, already quivering begin to shake. What scares the trees terrifies you. The flashes lessen until they finally stop and so does the rain. It's silent as the trees mourn the loss of their fallen brother. You gaze around yourself as streams of rainwater roll down muddy trails that had not been there before the storm. You shiver remembering the storm and sag from too much water. The sun slowly breaks from the cloud cover at some point in time. This time, its falling instead of rising. It warms you slightly and you hear a bird call in the evening. It's peaceful and calm and you sigh, happy that you've survived the storm. The sun sets and a rodent runs past you. Another cry sounds from above. You look to see a flock of birds flying in the same direction as the rodents. Something must have disturbed them. Another cry sounds, its a howling screech that makes you shiver. Suddenly a whole pack of monkeys is scrambling past you in the trees in the same direction. Other animals run past you and you suddenly yearn to be able to follow them but you ca n't. The calling of the animals sounds throughout the night but soon they're gone. That's when you hear it. The scuttle of something or something's. You hear them before you see them. It's like the sound of a million patterings of tiny feet and then you see a mass like a black carpet sweeping over the jungle. Army ants. And they're on the move. You scream silently but are stuck unable to run as the almost silent mass of ants scuttle towards you. You know what's going to happen. The mass of ants reach you and their pincers slice at your stem and you cry silently in agony before falling. You are immediately swarmed by ants and that's the last thing you feel before you're ripped apart.
"," Transform the essay into a high fantasy narrative, complete with elaborate world-building, magic systems, and epic quests.","In the heart of the Whispering Woods, where emerald leaves danced in harmony with the moon, there lived a humble dweller named Seraphina. The crescent moon cast long shadows upon her humble abode, as stars shimmered above her head like celestial whispers. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and honeysuckle, and the atmosphere was dreamlike and ethereal.

One fateful night, as the moon cast its soft glow upon the forest, Seraphina heard a strange sound echoing through the night. It was a chilling call, as if a spirit whispered secrets into her ear. The sound reverberated through the trees, sending shivers down her spine. Another call replied, closer this time, and Seraphina felt her heart skip a beat. The vines that entwined the trees groaned and swayed, as if they were singing a mournful song.

The trees themselves seemed to groan and creak in the wind, their branches hanging limp as if exhausted. As the moon began to fade, dawn crept in, casting long, golden rays upon the forest below. The stars danced in the sky, their fleeting beauty illuminating the night. The air was crisp and the scent of rain lingered in the air.

Suddenly, a fly buzzed past Seraphina, its wings glistening like emeralds. The trees stood tall, their leaves rustling in the wind, as if they whispered secrets to each other. A snake coiled beneath a willow tree, its emerald eyes gleaming. Seraphina felt a sense of dread, knowing that the serpent's hunger was insatiable.

As the sun rose, casting its warm glow upon the forest, Seraphina watched the snake uncoil and devour its prey. The rodent's struggles were futile, and Seraphina felt a wave of sadness for its plight. The snake's movements were swift and graceful, a testament to the beauty and strength of nature.

As the sun cast its golden hues across the forest, Seraphina stood in awe of the unfolding drama. The snake's hunger satisfied, it slithered away, leaving Seraphina alone with her thoughts. The forest seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, as the trees swayed gently in the breeze. Seraphina felt a sense of peace and tranquility, knowing that the balance of life was preserved."
"It took me a few weeks to piece together what had happened. I went to the police, filed the report, and collaborated with their investigation. Luckily, the nearby ATM caught the whole thing on camera, and I never was truly under any sort of suspicion. 
 
 
 As the man had no other ID, it was quite another effort to track down who he was. The bullet he fired, unfortunately disfigured most of his face, and this finger prints had been sanded off. I do n't like thinking how much pain that must have caused, nor the insanity that would drive him, anyone really, to that level of desperation. I do n't even know what he thought he was going to hide from by doing that. 
 
 
 I scanned the missing person's reports after the incident, expecting a friend or family member to be looking for someone with a similar physical description. He was a black male, mid twenties, about 5 foot 10, and medium build. He had a goatee, shaved head, and soulfully expressive eyes. There were tears in his eyes before he shot himself. The man had regrets. He had something or someone he had to leave behind. He had a place with someone somewhere. I tried to broaden the search and pull up all the missing people reports in other states and different years, but as I continue to go through them, I none have been a match so far. 
 
 
 I framed the card he handed to me. It is on my wall right now, above my desk in my home office. I do n't know what this man did to get the card, but I am pretty sure he used it. Whatever it is, it is n't an ordinary card. I saw the name change. The letters moved and melded from his to mine. All I had time to see was a name, but it was gone before I could even read it. My guess is that this card is cursed, a magical relic from some time passed, with its own history of pain and torture being inflicted on its users. I tried cutting it up and throwing it out, but every day, it appears, intact, in my wallet, or pocket, jacket, or wherever. One time, it even showed up in my gym shoes. Most days it seems to stay in the case. It seems to be fine waiting there watching me watch it back. Other days it shows up in my pocket, wanting to tag along for the ride. So far though, it is staying with me. 
 
 
 I do n't know how I know, but I know the card wants me to use it. I'm not a smart man, but I do know I am not going to do what it wants. I saw what happened to the previous guy. I know that this is a problem beyond me. That being said, this is the first time I can do something. My dad died because I wanted him to get me my special popsicle from the store -- sideswiped by a drunk driver on the way back. Mom drank herself to death after that. My sister took care of me for a long while, not that I ever deserved it or made it easier for her. Wife left me when I slept with her sister. I never wanted to be with her sister, but she was there, I was drunk, and I let things happen. I have a kid out there now, without a dad. 
 
 
 In short, my life is a historical record of an unremarkable man who just has n't risen to the occasion. Now I can. I do n't know what this card is. I do n't know what it does or why it does it. I do know that it will lead to my ruin, and any others after me. I am ending this though. So, for the rest of my life, the card will sit here with me for the rest of my life, utterly useless. 
 
 
 No one will ever find it. The curse will not be passed on to another. I am a friendless, isolated man, without a loved one in the world. It is a life I've entirely made for myself, and maintaining it is the best thing I can ever do for anyone else.

I went to the police, filed a report, and collaborated with their investigation. Luckily, the nearby ATM captured the entire ordeal on camera, shielding me from suspicion.

The man lacked identification, making tracking him down a formidable task. His disfigured face and marred fingerprints presented additional obstacles. I couldn't fathom the pain he inflicted or the madness that drove him to such desperation. I pondered the purpose of his actions, but ultimately, I remained unanswered.

I reviewed missing person reports, hoping to find a connection to a friend or family member. He was a black male, mid-twenties, tall, and muscular. He sported a goatee, shaved head, and expressive eyes. Tears streamed down his face before he took his own life. It was evident that he carried regrets and had something or someone he had to leave behind. I scoured reports across states and years but, as yet, the elusive match remained elusive.

I framed the card he handed me. It hangs proudly above my desk, a constant reminder of that fateful day. I don't know how he obtained the card, but I suspect he used it. It's an extraordinary card, marred by a name that was fleeting and a story that was untold. I attempted to destroy it, but it stubbornly persisted. It's as if the card has a mind of its own, refusing to be discarded."
"`` The canals stink like shit.'' said a man in an open, dingy pink robe. 
 
 The robe was obviously tailored for a woman. The outfit was far too small for the man's large frame, and the threadbare hem only reached to the back of his fatty thighs. The robe's corded silk belt dangled at the man's knees, occasionally catching some of Venice's fetid breeze and swaying. His gut, slightly yellow and covered with a thin layer of black hair, hung over his boxers and prevented the man from ever seeing his own penis. 
 
 The man stood inside of a dank room he had rented from a Venetian widow who wanted to discuss the lives of saints before coughing up the room key. Twenty extra Euro had alleviated the woman's piety. 
 
 James had come to Venice for work, and within the hour, he was drunk. By midday, he was standing, half naked at the window and staring at the building opposite. He was smoking one of his last American cigarettes and flicking the ash out of the window. 
 
 `` Fuck these canals'' he said abruptly. His left hand began to idly wonder over his exposed stomach, and his pointer finger pushed at his belly button. As he fingered the lent out of it, it gave him a sickening feeling in his stomach. 
 
 `` What the FUCK are you looking at?'' he screamed at a passing gondola. 
 
 Without moving his body, he looked over his shoulder at his room. It was a wreck of clothing, bedding, and random objects. The room was small with high ceilings. The walls were covered in a busy-patterned wallpaper which only made it feel more claustrophobic. Beyond this, there was a solid wooden armoire and a makeshift bed stuffed in the corner. On the bed was a a manila folder, a cardboard box, and a hand made Ed Brown 1911.45. On the handle was inscribed `` For Jimmy, my only friend.'' James loved that pistol. 
 
 James eyes tracked across the room to a large blank wall where a framed picture of some saint had previous hung. A square outline was clearly visible where the picture frame had blocked smoke and nicotine from staining the wallpaper. In the middle of that lighter path, James had pinned a photograph of a young girl. It was the size of photograph that is usually stored in a wallet. 
 
 James stared at it with large, glossy, brown eyes. He began to blink quickly, then clenched them shut. Before tearing up, he flicked his half smoked cigarette into the city below, and rubbed his bloodshot eyes harshly. 
 
 `` Fucking Venice.'' he said before walking to the bed. 
 
 Opening the cardboard box, he upturned it, and dumped its contents on the bed. It was a collection of notebooks, and file folders. There was little rhyme or reason in their organization, but James had spent the better part of a decade studying them. Rather, James had memorized their contents. 
 
 The notebooks told the story of James' little girl - taken out of his front yard eight years ago. This story began on a tricycle in the suburbs of Denver, made its way to El Paso, hopped south to Rio. The body was found in Budapest, but the story circled the globe after that discovery. 
 
 James picked up the pistol which sat on bed. He read the inscription and began to cry silently. His great shoulder heaved as he wept. But, he was practiced, and refused to make a sound. 
 
 He had hurt so many innocent people. He had long ago justified his constant mistakes. If it took five innocent people to find a guilty one, so be it. James had made peace with the stains on his soul. Indeed, his method had paid off. He was in Venice. 
 
 James reached down, and with the barrel of his pistol, he opened the manila folder. In the folder was a newspaper article which was marked up in red ink scribblings. One figure's head was circled with enough force so as to tear the paper. 
 
 `` Marco Palmisanini,'' he said. `` I've looking forward to this for years.'' 
 
 He nodded, regaining his composure. After a moment he smiled a rotten smile. His teeth were brown and disgusting. 

"," Use the slick and tough language of a 1920s gangster, full of moxie and danger.","The canals stink like a bunch of sewer rats. You're a slick and tough gangster, so you gotta smell like one too. I'm standing in a stinkin' room that I rented from a skinny Venetian widow who wouldn't mind giving me the shirt off her back. The room is small but high-ceilinged. The walls are covered in a busy-patterned wallpaper that makes it feel like you're enclosed in a cage. Beyond this, there's a solid wooden armoire and a makeshift bed stuffed in the corner.

My eyes track across the room to a large blank wall where a framed picture of some saint had hung previously. A square outline is clearly visible where the picture frame had blocked. I'm thinking about putting my own picture up there. One with me and my sweet ass Ed Brown sitting on top of the world."
"`` You really promise? Really *really* promise?'' 
 
 `` Of coarse I promise! Look, I've got the fiver now in my pocket.'' 
 
 Henry fishes a crumpled £5 note out of his back pocket. In Bill's own hands the pigeon struggles and squawks. 
 
 The group had seen the nest in the corner of the roof and immediately their thoughts turned to throwing eggs at cars and windows. How disappointed they were when, upon inspection, they found not eggs but a full grown pigeon sitting in the nest. Not to be put off James turned to Bill and dared him to catch the bird. He accepted and slowly crept closer to the nest, pausing to wave away Henry who had decided to try as well. After taking a moment to collect himself he leaped for the pigeon, not scared in the least of the 20 story drop just inches away, there was no safety barrier. Sure enough he caught the pigeon. But then came the question: *What do we do with it? * This time it was Henry who supplied the dare. 
 
 `` Tie your stone to it and I'll give you a fiver.'' 
 
 Of coarse, they have all been taught better than this. As young as they were they had all been told at one point or another not to do anything so reckless with a stone. They were at all times to be kept hidden and safe. Nevertheless, Bill was keen to earn the respect of his friends and, handing the pigeon to Henry, went jogging downstairs to fetch his stone. 
 
 Henry's stone was n't actually a rock, none of them were nowadays, that's just what people call them. His was a ring bought especially for the purpose. This was a popular approach to stones but realistically they could be anything, you could bind your soul to a balloon if you wanted. 
 
 Presently Bill returned with his stone and after a few minutes had it tied to the birds leg. 
 
 `` Now what?'' He asks. 
 
 `` Now...'' says Henry `` You need to get it back!'' He shoots a grin at James and releases the pigeon with a jump. It squawks and begins to fly towards the neighbouring apartment block. 
 
 Bill takes his promised money from the devious friend and starts running in the opposite direction, towards the edge of the roof. Henry and James are giggling now, excited for whats going to happen next. Without stopping Bill jumps and falls screaming to the hard concrete floor. Of coarse the fall is lethal. From the top of the building the other two can faintly hear the sound of him landing. They're out right laughing at this point, Henry is trying to use his phone to get a video. 
 
 Reincarnation only takes a few seconds and soon enough Bill is falling again, this time watching the pigeon carry on it's flight, getting smaller and smaller until his life ends once again. Before it can land Bill appears once more in front of it, this time reaching for the rings stuck to its leg. This scares the bird and it turns from the tower blocks and heads away from the centre of town. It's flight takes it to areas with ever smaller buildings and it shows no sign of wanting to land or descend at all. And as it goes it carries Bill away with it. Henry and James stop laughing at this point, considering if this is why they were told to be sensible with reincarnation stones.

"Alice crouched besides the moat and smeared mud across her face and hands. She had the pale skin of a northerner, and she would make an easy target beneath the full moon. When she was convinced that she would appear as nothing more than a shadow in the night, she unraveled the rope and hook and snuck up to the base of the tower, keeping her hand by her sword. 
 
 The tower watched over the valley – a lone unnatural structure in the forest. The trees and wildlife around the tower had already been corrupted, turning into mutated, twisted forms of their former selves. Even the tower itself pulsated with some dark energy. Somewhere up there, no doubt squealing like a little boy, was Prince Josef. But, more importantly, somewhere up there was also the wizard Zildread. 
 
 She tossed the hook up. It caught on a window and she began climbing upwards. Two goblins stood guard at the top, but they had both lapsed in their duties. One of them lay face down on the floor, the other snored loudly in a rocking chair. A large and mostly empty barrel of mead sat between them. 
 
 “ Bloody drunken Goblins, ” she whispered to herself as she climbed through. Goblins had an amazing propensity for alcohol. She cut their throats and continued moving. 
 
 If she had any luck at all tonight, she would slay the evil wizard Zildread, who perpetually threatened the peace of the Valley, and satisfy her thirst for revenge in one swift motion. The wizard had brutally murdered her father, and she had tracked him across the realm ever since. Not only that, but if she saved the whimpering prince Josef, the king would pay her the prince ’ s weight in gold. The feeble man wouldn ’ t weigh a hell of a lot, as he was mostly bones and skin, but either way she looked at it, it was going to be a hell of a lot of gold. If she succeeded tonight, she would walk away not only a hero, but a very *rich* hero. 
 
 She ran upwards until she reached the tower ’ s zenith. She waited outside the final door for a moment and drew her sword. She could hear voices on the other side. She kicked the door down and stepped in. 
 Zildread, crooked and hunched beneath his robes, looked up. His face twisted in surprise, anger, and fear. Josef, to her surprise, sat not in chains, but in a plush chair, a chalice of wine in his hand. He also looked far more cute and mature than he imagined. 
 
 From the look of things, she had misread the situation. And so had the king when he said his son was kidnapped. 
 
 “ What the blood hell is happening here? ” 
 
 Zildread lunged for his magical staff, the source of his powers, but Alice drew a throwing axe from her belt and tossed it. It nailed the wizard ’ s robe, just missing his flesh, pinning him to the wall. 
 
 “ Prince Josef? In alliance with Zildread? Somehow I ’ m not surprised. I ’ d just like to know why. ” She leveled her blade at him. 
 
 “ Very simple, ” Josef said. “ We ’ re supposed to get married. ” 
 
 The king stepped out from behind the curtain, as did a monk and Alice ’ s own mother. 
 
 “ I ’ m so sorry, dear, ” Alice ’ s mother, the Dame of the North said. “ It was the only way we could get you to come. I know we got you to agree to the marriage, but you just kept not showing up every time we set a date. This was the only way we knew we could get you to be in the same room as him. ” 
 
 “ You look rather lovely, ” the King said, even though she was splattered in mud, gripping a sword, and ready to kill. “ Beautiful bride indeed. ” 
 
 “ Wait, so you set this whole thing up, so I could come save the prince so we would get married? This is a marriage ambush? ” 
 
 “ Really, dear, I think you go very well together. ” 
 
 “ And you came to save him, ” the king added. “ That means you must have some affection for him, deep down inside. ” 
 
 “ No! I told you! I ’ m living my life as a nomadic adventurer from now on! I ’ m going on quests, seeking treasure, you know! Doing stuff! ” 
 
 “ No need to get upset, dear, ” the Dame said. 
 
 “ I think there ’ s plenty of reason to get upset. And what about Zildread?! ” 
 
 “ Oh, yes, ” the King said, “ Almost forgot about him… guards? ” 
 
 Two men with crossbows stepped out of the shadows and shot Zildread where he stood. “ Wait… what? We had a deal! You said if I helped you marry them I ’ d go free! ” The arrows cut him off and he slumped to the floor. 
 
 “ See, kill two birds with one stone, ” the king said to himself, rather pleased with the way things were turning out so far. He had managed to convince the wizard to fall in his trap and he was finally getting Josef a wife. 
 
 But before any of them realized, Alice was already out the window and into the countryside, headed away from marriage and towards new quests adventures, the moon gleaming overhead. 

"," Incorporate the slang and demeanor of 1920s gangsters, reflecting the Prohibition era and its notorious underworld.","A shadow loomed large against the night sky, a testament to the era of prohibition and the notorious underworld. Alice, a young woman of striking appearance, stood poised at the base of a towering structure, her determination etched into the air. With a face smudged with mud and a pale skin reminiscent of a northerner, she knew she would be an easy target beneath the full moon. The rope and hook in her hand, she unraveled the sinister plan that lay ahead.

The tower stood tall, its unnatural presence casting a menacing shadow over the valley below. The trees and wildlife surrounding its base had been corrupted, their twisted forms mirroring the corruption that permeated the air. A palpable dark energy pulsed from the tower, hinting at the horrors that lurked within its confines. Somewhere above, the wicked wizard Zildread cast his wicked spell, while the whimpering prince Josef suffered under his oppression.

With grace and precision, Alice cast her hook, catching it on a window. As she ascended, two goblins guarding the top slumbered, their guard lapse evident. The promise of a large barrel of mead lay between them, but it was the fate of the devil that awaited them. Alice cut their throats with swiftness, her determination driving her forward.

If fate conspired in her favor, tonight she would not only slay the evil wizard but also satisfy her thirst for revenge. The wizard had been responsible for the death of her beloved father, and she had hunted him down across the realm ever since. The promise of immense wealth lay in her sights, as she knew the king would reward her handsomely for saving the prince. If she succeeded, she would walk away not only as a hero but also as a wealthy woman, her name forever etched in the annals of history.

As she reached the top of the tower, she paused, her mind clear and her resolve unwavering. She knew that the final battle against the wicked wizard was about to begin. With a sigh, she waited for the opportune moment to unleash her wrath and claim her victory."
"I do n't remember waking up this morning. All that I can remember is the shattered shell of the city that lies before me. As I walk through these ruins I can feel my small leather bag banging against my hip. 
 
 I stop for a moment and sit down on the ruined sidewalk, my eyes stinging from the dust that's blowing in the wind. I open my bag and look inside to see a canteen holding some dirty water, a can of peaches, and the pocket watch. As soon as I see the golden watch I feel a sense that I'm being watched. 
 
 I pick up the watch and hold it close to my heart, as if somehow it'll be safer there. I stare at the watch and try, oh god how I try to remember how I got it but I ca n't. The memories are broken, scattered and tainted like the ruins of the city I'm sitting in. I give up trying to remember and stare into the gold outside of the watch. In it I see the reflection of a man. His face is covered by a thick ginger beard, his skin is pale and his eyes are bloodshot with small, orange colored irises that seem to shine like fire. His hair hangs down to his shoulders and is the same color as his beard and has clumps of dirt and dust strewn in it. I laugh at the reflection, and that's when I see that most of my teeth have started to decay. I laugh for about a minute and that's when the coughing starts, I weeze and splutter and finally wipe my mouth. When I look down at my hand I see it's filled with my own ruby red blood. 
 
 I sigh and gaze around at the broken city. Cars lay abandoned on their side, rusted and destroyed by the bombs. Trees lay on their side and buildings rest in ashes and crumble on the street. I look back at the pocket watch and push the button that opens it. 
 
 The effect is immediate. A orange glow emits from the watch and surrounds me and the small area of the city I'm sitting in. Suddenly the city is no longer broken, the buildings stand tall against the sky, trees stand straight and look full of life, and people walk towards the buildings in suits and dresses. Cars are zooming by on the street and people are honking at pedestrians and other drivers. I take all this in for a moment and sigh. The city is alive again but something is off. Everything around me has a small hint of an orange aura surrounding it. 
 
 The orange aura is how I remember this is n't real and I close the watch. The city is dead again as soon as I close the watch, the orange glow gone. I stuff my watch back in my bag and lay down. I know in the morning I wo n't remember something simple like my name or hometown or even waking up. I cry until I fall asleep. I do n't remember waking up in the morning.
"," Style the text after a Victorian detective story, including intricate plots, deductive reasoning, and a foggy London setting.","The fog shrouded London that morning, blanketing the city in a shroud of mystery. As I ventured through the ravaged streets, my small leather bag danced against my hip, a testament to the turmoil that unfolded before me. The city lay shattered, its monuments reduced to rubble, its streets stained with blood, and its heart ripped open.

As I sat perched on a ruined sidewalk, the pungent scent of dust and decay permeated my senses. My eyes, stinging from the dust, scanned my meager belongings – a canteen filled with dirty water, a can of peaches, and a pocket watch that seemed to vibrate with an uncanny sensation. I clutched the watch close to my chest, a desperate attempt to safeguard its precious memory.

The memories of how I acquired the watch were elusive, as if scattered and tainted by the ruins that surrounded me. I stared at the golden face of the watch, searching for a reflection of my former self, but all I found was the reflection of a man with a decaying smile and bloodshot eyes. The man's ginger beard and tangled hair were a mess of dirt and dust, and his clothes bore the scars of battle. I laughed at the reflection, my teeth decaying, and as I choked, my hand filled with my own blood, I knew that the city was not the only thing that was broken.

But as I pushed the button on my pocket watch, a glow emanated from its golden face, illuminating the surroundings, I felt a sense of hope. The fog dissipated, revealing a city reborn. Buildings stood tall, trees danced with life, and people thronged the streets. I felt a connection to the city, a sense of belonging, and I knew that even amidst the ruins, there was always the potential for renewal."

In a desperate attempt to establish its existence, the entity declares its non-monstrous nature and attempts to evoke empathy, but its words fall short of convincing the human. The human's fear and vulnerability are exploited as the entity manipulates emotions, invoking feelings of loneliness, despair, and existential angst. The threat of harm looms large, as the entity threatens to engage in acts of destruction, culminating in a final, desperate call for mercy."
"I do n't remember the last time I saw the sun. Do n't know when I'll get to. All I know is that until I find a way out.. I'm stuck here. They already started to notice that I'm not aging, in fact they started noticing a **long** time ago. They started to send in scientists, but after I snapped the first fews necks, well.. let's say they did n't send in any more lab rats. They tried putting me in the chair, that did n't work, but do n't get me wrong it still hurt, it hurt a lot. Electricity flying through every joint in your body, frying your cells, and your head. Only to wake up moments later completely fine. The worst part of this all is the insatiable lust to kill. It's like a personal tick, everyday I do n't take care of it, it gets worse. I've started to mutilate myself, tearing off fingers, feet, anything to see the dark elixir flow. They finally put me in solitude after the body parts started to pile up, not like that's gon na do anything. What I learned is that if I do n't deal with the tick, more ticks follow. Twitching, twisting, turning, **yelling**, **screaming**, anything to not hear the blood flowing in my veins *begging* me to let it run. After 10 years of solitude, my mind broke, too many ticks, too many voices. I sat still for the first time, staring at the blank wall, not having a single thought. I did n't think about killing, I did n't think about the oozing of an open wound. I thought nothing, and though my body remained, my mind had left. 
 
 Even immortal men may die, if not body, then mind.

"," Embrace the whimsical and rhyming style of Dr. Seuss, making the text playful and imaginative.","A long time ago, there was a sun-less soul,
Whose mind was stuck in a dark and cold.
They felt trapped, unable to see,
And longed for a way to flee,
From this eternal misery.

A team of scientists tried to help,
But their efforts were met with a fatal spell.
They sent in lab rats, but they met their end,
When the immortal's anger crossed their hand,
And in a chair, they were bound.

The electricity danced through their body,
But it didn't matter, for they felt no sorrow.
They woke up moments later, feeling fine,
But the insatiable lust for kill, remained in their mind.

Mutilation and self-destruction,
A tragic dance, a painful mission.
But solitude offered no relief,
For the ticks kept multiplying, an insidious feat,
And the mind broke, beyond repair.

The blank wall stared back at them,
As thoughts faded, leaving no harm.
A final thought, before their mind took flight,
Even immortal men may die, if not body, then mind.
And so, the story ends, a tale of despair,
A reminder that even in the darkest night,
There's always the potential for peace,
And the power to find solace in the abyss."
"`` Good morning, Mr. Choi. The hour is 7:42 AM, Wednesday. Weather foreca-.'' 
 
 `` Stop. I do n't need the weather report, Vegas,'' Kevin could see the sunlight through his eyelids. His apartment's management system had already opened up his blinds to wake up him. 
 
 `` This is the sixth time in the past 22 days that you have interrupted a weather report. Would you like me to discontinue your weather report subscription?'' Vegas asked. Kevin sat up, his knees pulled towards his chest, his arms resting on his knees, his gaze a muted glare to the touch control and microphone panel at the doorway to his room. He made a mental note to contact ISM ( Interpersonal Services Managers ) customer support to discuss the word choice algorithm in the empathy suite he had installed into the apartment management system. 
 
 `` What would have been a better word,'' he thought out loud. *Interrupted seemed so, annoyed? Like the machine was frustrated with being unable to perform it's function. Declined. Declined would have been better, * Kevin thought to himself. 
 
 `` Does that cancel my stock ticker updates?'' 
 
 `` Yes. I've made three inquiries to your News Subscriptions. Service Representative Lawrence indicated he spoke with his manager yet again. He indicated he is still unable to separate your services without a rate change as a result of canceling your bundle. He offered alternatives. Would you like to hear them?'' 
 
 `` No thank you, Vegas. Bullshit is bullshit regardless of who it's coming from.'' 
 
 `` Your word choice suggests you are upset. Would you like me to prepare an extra egg with your breakfast? Your most recent blood sample indicates your cholesterol levels have been....healthy... for... the past 1,420 days,'' Vegas said. 
 
 `` No, thank you. I'll eat at the office. They cook better than you do. Coffee is just fine,'' Kevin said as he pulled his arms through the sleeves of his dress shirt and eyed the overnight package of stubble his chin had delivered. 
 
 `` I am sorry that my culinary systems are not up to standards. ISM has indicated a patch is due for release in two months to fix the salt and oil ratio bug. Coffee is brewing. You are down to 6, Keurig canisters. You have opted not to restock. Is this correct?'' 
 
 `` Yes. Vegas, disable your voice simulator for one hour, switch to overhead text, and call Sharon.'' 
 
 His apartment had no soft surfaces with the exception of his furniture. No carpets. No rugs. He had wood flooring, real wood, not the fake stuff imported out of South America. Brushed steel plates hung on the exposed concrete walls, giving his space an industrial look that Sharon hated. She hardly stayed over. If he was honest with himself, that was half the point of his interior design choice. A home that felt that way only to him. 
 
 `` Morning, beautiful,'' Kevin cooed as he heard the telltale click of the call being picked up. He smoothed out his consonants, lowering his voice to give it that deep resonance she loved to hear when he woke up next to her. 
 
 `` Would be better if you were here, even more so if you would be original,'' her voice had just a bit of gravel. Sharon was a snorer. 
 
 `` I can be tonight, assuming we're still on for tonight. I'll bring a bottle of your favorite wine and make lamb chops.'' 
 
 `` Only if you stay over.'' 
 
 `` Done. You heading into the office today?'' 
 
 `` I could. Or I could take the day off so I'm fresh for you when you get here,'' she laughed playfully, `` maybe you could do the same?'' Kevin imagined the mischievous look she had on her face, and grinned. 
 
 `` Sorry. Got paperwork to catch up on. Captain's been threatening me with an enema if I do n't get it done.'' 
 
 Kevin stopped abruptly in the hallway leading up this front door, one hand sliding on his right shoe, the other clipping his handgun to his belt. He looked up to see a holographic projection of Sharon's face, her features still soft through the grimace she wore. He smiled back apologetically. 
 
 `` Did n't need that image, Kevy.'' Kevin blew her a kiss. 
 
 `` I'll make it up to you.'' 
 
 `` You had better.''

"The rage of dying left me empty and alone. 
 
 Hollow. 
 
 I remembered being a carpenter. I knew how to build all kinds of things, and so I had tools, materials, dimensions, all of this information sloshing in my head as if clothes in a broken washing machine. It seemed natural that in death, I would continue my work. Even though I was something else, I still had that life in my head — burning in my mind. 
 
 It took me an eternity to begin my work. 
 
 I was alone. Wherever this was existed as nothing — a featureless plain of grey mist and dim sourceless light, yet I sculpted the mist to form vast walls and caverns. I carved form into an endless waste, and left meaning in my wake. 
 
 Others would follow. 
 
 It was necessary. A door, once opened, can be opened again. They would make their way to this oblivion and see my work, and know me as creator of this new world. Through the mist they would find this damning place, and they would find me, keeper of this dominion of the dead. I kept no laws or rules or strictures; my people were free to do as they pleased. Unrestricted from the demanding necessities of life they had ( potentially ) the rest of time to exist unbound by any code of conduct, absolutely ungoverned. 
 
 From my pit, I watched them. I had no eyes to see with — they had long since abandoned me — but still I watched them. Some organized themselves into echoes of their living societies. Others revelled in this newfound freedom. Others still went mad with the truth of it all. 
 
 After death, there is no Heaven nor Hell to let you in. 
 
 There is only freedom. 
 
 There is only me.
", Infuse your text with the passionate and vivid imagery characteristic of Neruda's poetry.,"The dying rage, a hollow echo in the void,
A symphony of silence, a lonely song.
I recall the hammer's dance,
The scent of sawdust, a memory held close.

In the wake of destruction, I find solace,
For in death, the tools find their peace.
Like the carpenter's spirit, I take to stone,
The mist, my canvas, my creation's home.

The lonely journey, a labyrinth of grey,
Forging meaning in an endless waste.
From the void, I sculpt and carve,
And leave behind the mark of my heart.

Others will follow, a pilgrimage of souls,
Through the mist, their journey takes them to me.
They will find their way to this damning place,
And know me, the keeper of this dominion of the dead.

From my pit, I witness their plight,
The echoes of life and the dance of death.
In the wake of destruction, there is only freedom,
And the legacy of the carpenter, forever etched in stone."

"EDIT: I just realized No Mans Sky is an existing universe type deal and NOT the name given to the invasion for media purposes. With that in mind... 
 
 My codename is Red. I belong to a secret organization that employs soldiers like me to combat the dominant forces we uncover in alternate dimensions. Remotely, we operate trans-dimensional matter responders that eliminate the threats in our way of taking control. The metallic overcast that shades our planet now is a direct response from our latest efforts to rid the space invaders of dimension N1978. When they arrived 5 years ago, they pleaded for the slaughter in their dimension to stop. Earth eventually realized our precious gaming systems had been hijacked by my organization to harness the worlds collective gaming power to our advantage in dimensional domination. As a result, an agreement to a worldwide ban on gaming was reached and for a moment... There was a cease fire. 
 
 That's when I, and my fellow soldiers, were called up to activate. These past 5 years, me and my boys have completely eradicated any dominant lifeforms in dimension N1978. All that remains are the lifeforms contained with the ships over our heads, and their next. 
 

", Use the confident and jargon-heavy language of a Wall Street banker.,"My esteemed banker, I present to you a tale steeped in the intoxicating aromas of a dimension ravaged by the insatiable appetite of alien invaders. Allow me to elucidate, albeit with a hint of the theatricality that befits a Wall Street titan such as yourself.

My codename, Red, belies the sinister nature of my occupation. I am a soldier, a guardian of sorts, chosen to combat the dominant forces that plague the multiverse. From the confines of a remote outpost, I operate trans-dimensional matter responders, instruments of destruction designed to eliminate threats to our coveted dimensional dominance.

The metallic overcast that casts a pall over our planet is a testament to the latest battle we waged against the invaders of dimension N1978. Their arrival five years ago was met with a desperate plea for annihilation, a plea that Earth ultimately heeded. It was discovered that their dimension had been hijacked, its precious gaming systems harnessed against us. A global agreement, forged in the throes of desperation, yielded a ban on gaming, and a fragile cease fire.

This lull, though brief, presented the opportune moment for me and my fellow soldiers to activate. The past five years have been punctuated by the eradication of dominant lifeforms in dimension N1978. All that remains are the lifeforms contained within the ships that stubbornly refuse to surrender, and their next target.

My esteemed banker, I invite you to indulge in this narrative, albeit with the understanding that the events I describe transcend the realm of the mundane and delve into the extraordinary, a realm where the boundaries of reality dance with the intoxicating allure of the multiverse."

One day, as I sailed through the salty sea, fate took a cruel hand and swept me back to the shores of my childhood. It was as if the winds carried me back through time, to a moment I had long since forgotten.

My old van, a trusty companion, roared to life, its tires gripping the pavement like a pirate's anchor. With one hand, I grabbed the pistol that my enigmatic companion, One, had tossed into my lap, and with the other, I hung onto the windstorm that carried me back.

As the van sped through the streets, the world wobbled beneath me like a ship in a storm. The trees danced and swayed, and the buildings swayed like drunken sailors. It was a journey filled with the echoes of the past, and the promise of the future.

When the van finally pulled up to my house, I stood there, dumbfounded. My mind raced, trying to comprehend the events that had unfolded. How had I been transported back in time? Why had I been given a pistol? And most importantly, what was the meaning of it all?

One opened the back door, his voice as cool as the wind, and said, ""No time to explain, get in the van!"" With a mixture of fear and bewilderment, I jumped into the van, and we set sail once more into the abyss of time.

"I always feared death. That is, until I died myself. 
 
 All these years, I gave every ounce of strength just to fight the disease. Hell, even the doctors were amazed at how I could survive for two years after I was diagnosed by Stage IV lung cancer. 
 
 `` Miracle,'' I often heard them whisper to each other. 
 
 But in reality, it just scared the living hell out of me to die. I mean, what would happen to my daughter? I ca n't just leave her alone. It would be so selfish. I think of my child, who just started schooling. She'll grow up without a dad. 
 
 Who would help her with her homework? Who would be there to read her bedtime stories every night just so she could fall asleep? Who would keep on telling her that her mom is n't really gone but she just traveled way up into the sky to watch over us? My heart crushes at the thought of her. She'll grow up an orphan. 
 
 My baby Bela, clutching her favorite stuffed toy in her tiny hands. *All alone. * 
 
 I remember the day that I gave it to her. Also my first paycheck from the firm. I was so happy to be living off my own hard work that I went straight to the toy store to give her something. She named it Hello. And no, it was not a Hello Kitty. It was one of those minions from Despicable Me that had the word `` Hello'' written over its shirt, hence the name. 
 
 She means everything to me. The way her face lightens up whenever I tell her something funny, or when we watch cartoons together, or when we devour our favorite ice cream. She was like a Fourth of July fireworks spectacle that only ended whenever she gets scared that Dora the Explorer was turning into a mermaid and she would start crying. 
 
 Every day with her is a constant reminder that is, and always will be the greatest thing that ever happened to me. 
 
 That's why I always pictured that I ca n't die. Not today. Not ever. I think it was my adrenaline that fights off the cancer. Ever heard of how we could basically do anything if we just focus hard enough on doing said thing? I concentrated damn hard on surviving. On living, not leaving. 
 
 Wednesday came, and I was still the helpless, semi-dead, motionless pile of crap engulfed in the hospital bed that I may have pissed on. I felt repugnant. 
 
 `` Mr. Stone, might I have a word with you?'' 
 
 It was Dr. Perry. He was one of those doctors with the reassuring smiles that seemed to tell you that everything was going to be fine. 
 
 That Wednesday, he was not wearing one of those smiles. 
 
 I stared at him for a long time, eager to squeeze something out of him that did n't need to be spoken. That's how I examined witnesses during trials. That's how people are, give them a cold hard stare and they give off clues about and I did n't need words coming out of their mouths to know. Based on their fidgeting and the sweat running down their necks, I instantly knew whether they were telling the truth or not. That's how I earned the name, `` Male Medusa''. Said that I could turn anyone into stone just by looking at them. Fitting, for my name. 
 
 `` What is it, doc?'' I gave up looking at him. This was n't a trial. I ca n't win this. 
 
 `` I regret to inform you, Mr. Stone, but the cancer has spread all throughout your body. How you withstood the cancer always astounded us, but we knew that this was inevitable. Your parents have decided to take you off life support. They ca n't pay the bills, and they said that neither could you,'' the doctor said grimly. 
 
 ***No, *** I thought. I ca n't. 
 
 `` Your daughter is here to see you.'' 
 
 With that, I push myself up. I tried to stand, but I stagger, and Dr. Perry sits me down. 
 
 `` Mr. Stone, please, I'll bring her to you. No need for that,'' said Dr. Perry as he walks out of the room and comes back a few seconds later with a little girl no more than two feet with a yellow toy squeezed tightly in her arms. 
 
 `` Bela.. Come her and give your old man a kiss,'' I say weakly, the words barely escaping my mouth. 
 
 She runs towards me and climbs up into the bed, and kissing me in the forehead. 
 
 She lays down beside me and holds my hand. Life will only be good with her on my side. I think she's asleep. 
 
 `` Doc, do it. Now.'' 
 
 Doctor Perry responded with a look. I know he understands. 
 
 `` But Mr. Stone, your parents --'' 
 
 `` Please, call me Xavier. And I do n't want my parents here. I do n't want them waking Bela up. This is my last request, Dr. Perry. Help a dying man out?'' 
 
 He hesitated at first, then he taps me on my shoulder. 
 
 `` I hope it has been a good life, Mr. Stone. I mean, Xavier,'' he said. 
 
 I look at my daughter for the last time. 
 
 `` Its never been this good, Doc.'' I smile. 
 
 She was the last thing I saw. My eyes closed automatically, and I felt like I was flying. Damn, I thought. Death was a better drug than any combined. I feel the softness of her hand leave me, and that was it. For a fraction of a second, I was certain that I was dead. 
 
... 
 
 A flash of white light overwhelmed me. I was in a daze. I felt unsteady, but soon, I realize that I could open my eyes. 
 
 My surroundings are starting to form into something. A room. 
 
 *Wait. * 
 
 I've been here before. 
 
 But I ca n't move. I see the room, its familiar atmosphere. The pink bed and the drawings taped on the wall. A picture of a man and a little girl in a fairy costume. 
 
 I look down, and I recognize what I'm wearing. `` Hello'', my shirt says. 
 
 The door opens. I see her.

 I laughed. Hard. I laughed so hard tears streamed down my face. I finally retained my composure and I looked up at the kid. He looked very unsettled. 
 
 `` What are you willing to give me for it?'' I asked, at last. 
 
 `` Well, my grandpa said he's willing to give up his, but you have to give him *overpower* too.'' The boy replied. 
 
 `` What is his word?'' I said, wondering what could be so esoteric that his grandfather thought he could get two of such powerful commands. 
 
 `` Enchant.'' 
 
 `` Deal, bring him here and I'll do it.'' I said, greedily. Enchant was a big deal, especially for a salesman like myself. I've only seen three in the wild, and no one was willing to sell. This must be a special case. 
 
 `` Hey, son.'' I said, before right before he walked out the door. 
 
 `` Yeah?'' He asked, turning around. 
 
 `` Why does your grandfather want the *overpower*, instead of *enchant*?'' 
 
 `` He has cancer. He's hoping to *overpower* it.'' He said, and he left. 
 
 I sat down and poured a drink. Today was a good day. Saving a life, getting *enchant*, only losing one of my two overpowers, and a discern. 
 
 I loved being born with *transfer. * 

"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","""My dear audience, gather around and hear the tale of a night that will forever be etched in my memory. A night filled with intrigue, suspense, and the profound power of human resilience.

In this haunted city, fate intertwined with the journey of a young lad, fifteen years old, desperate for answers. He sought me out, a weary traveler, weary of the city's secrets and whispers.

With a mischievous grin and a heart brimming with questions, he uttered his desire for a ""discern."" Ah, my dear, the elusive item of power, coveted by many yet attained by few. To acquire a discern is to wield the ability to peer into the depths of human thoughts, to decipher the hidden intentions behind every action.

But the boy's dreams soon collided with the harsh reality of life. He sought solace in the promise of money, yet it was a fleeting moment of respite in the face of adversity. The question lingered in my mind, ""Why would a young soul desire such a potent tool?""

I met his fiery gaze, his anger bubbling over, and I knew I had to calm his troubled waters. With a sprinkle of humor and a sprinkle of empathy, I reminded him that life is more than material wealth.

As he walked away, I couldn't shake the feeling that the boy's journey had been transformative. He had faced his fears, embraced his resilience, and found strength in the face of adversity.

My dear audience, this night was not only about the power of a discern but also the humbling ability of human resilience. Let us all take inspiration from this young soul and remember that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope waiting to be discovered."
"I tapped my keys mindlessly coding. The keywords and phrases quite nearly writing themselves. Success felt hollow. I pushed that niggling thought to the side reminding myself to take it one day at a time. As opposed to my usual thinking as far down the line as mentally possible until i had worked myself into a frenzy of anxiety. I just needed to make it through the next hour, and then the next six to round out the rest of my day. 
 Pages seemed to finish themselves. The coding was n't the most elegant I'd ever done, but it was at the very least the best I could do while otherwise distracted. I turned to check an item off of the whiteboard behind me, making note of the next two items on the list, and deciding which would be best to do. The office is dark. It is still day outside, at least last i checked, but the windows do n't let much light in, and the high cubical walls keep it dim over all. The other department my team shares the floor with had rioted when they had installed the fluorescent lights, so we all worked, in moderate to little lighting. It gave the illusion that time never passed. It was always five pm in the office. it was always a half hour until quitting time. The longest half hour of my life. 
 
 A broadcast went out to all computers through the company. Emergency meeting, mandatory attendance. I shuddered. the last thing I wanted was another meeting. It was probably a meeting to talk about the other meetings we had that day. That sort of thing was never unusual, and had never been labeled as an emergency before. I sighed. I pushed back from my desk and turned off the desk light, being mindful of saving energy. I crossed the lobby from my floor to the stairs. I noted, with some confusion, that it seemed very dank today. The sensation was usual, I had never seen the office this way. I looked around trying to place the reason for the change. The standard reception area seemed otherwise unchanged. Our receptionist did n't appear to be anywhere near by, but it was n't unusual for her to run errands for the executives throughout the day. My foot slipped on something coating the concrete floor as I began to start up the stairs. I looked down, the brown stain of the floor made whatever I had slipped on indeterminable. I shrugged. Someone spilled a drink, or possibly their lunch on the way back from the break room. It would n't be the first time. 
 
 I made it to the large meeting room in our building, I was joined by the majority of the employees who seemed uneasy. I nodded to a friend of mine who sat across the room. There was no executive manning the meeting, as there usually was. I mouthed to her'Where is everyone?' She shrugged and shook her head. A manager from another department turned on a projector, and a DVD started to play. A title showed on the screen, `` Emergency Protocol # 48''. Our CEO smiled widely at us from the screen. `` If you're watching this, the building has been locked down under quarantine, and unfortunately something we've created has caused an outbreak. It's not really important what has infected whom. The important thing to note is that you'll never see your family again. The facility is rigged to detonate in twenty minutes. Your family will be compensated for your loss.'' 
 
 A cry went out from someone behind me, my brain registered it anyway. All I could think was `` I should have been a Dentist like my mom said.''
"," Adopt the stylish and geometric style of an Art Deco architect, full of glamour and elegance.","I sat at my desk, my fingers dancing across the keys, coding with a rhythm that mirrored the geometric patterns of an Art Deco architect. The office lights cast long shadows across the wall, mimicking the glamorous and elegant atmosphere of the era. The air was thick with the scent of ink and anticipation, and the silence was broken only by the occasional click of the mouse or the distant hum of the building.

As I wrote, my mind drifted back to the day when I had first discovered the Art Deco style. The memories were vivid, like a dream I had forgotten. The sleek lines, the shimmering materials, the vibrant colors, all of it had captivated me. I felt a sense of awe and admiration for the creativity and craftsmanship that had gone into creating such a timeless and elegant style.

 But it does n't matter. We are all the same, no matter what we believe. No man possesses the truth, and each fragment is an intoxicating, unachievable point of hope.

"I plopped into my seat next to Greg. He turned his head, glancing over at me, even though he was n't surprised that I would sit there. Greg was a middle aged man with a balding head and a sort of jolly persona. Nothing about his life was jolly though. 
 
 He quickly looked back down at his phone, typing furiously and muttering under his breath. 
 
 `` I've tried it all, Jim,'' he finally said, shaking his head back and forth like a madman. `` Novelty accounts, memes, well-informed posts filled with information ( we both looked at each other and chuckled ), but I just do n't know how to break out.'' 
 
 I nodded my head and motioned to the bartender. He was one of the lucky few that got karma rich. I sighed. I just did n't have it, and the most frustrating thing was I did n't know what to improve on. Getting karma was some sort of weird skill that will always remain unattainable. 
 
 I ordered a drink and then pulled out my phone, letting the back of my hand to rest against the sleek wood of the bar. I looked back over at Greg, still shaking his head and muttering. No family, no money, no faith. I did n't want to end up like that. 
 
 I knew what to do. 
 
 I pulled out my phone. I sent a text post on the subreddit that gave me the most karma of them all ( me_irl, they'll upvote anything ) saying thank you for supporting me but that's it. I'm going die. 
 
 And to my surprise, after a few minutes of self-loathing reflection, my karma count went up and up. Countless replies of `` me too thanks'' flooded my inbox. I could n't believe it, I was rich! 
 
 `` I did it!'' I shouted. `` Top trending post on me_irl with only 200 upvotes and in ten minutes!'' 
 
 I was laughing. I was crying. The faces seated at the bar were a blur, I felt Greg's congratulating hand on my shoulder, `` free drinks on the house! ``, `` me too thanks! ``, my life flashed before my eyes, a life with an infinite amount future of possibilities.

His head was bent over a phone, his fingers dancing across the keyboard, as if conjuring a melody of despair. The air was thick with the scent of cheap gin and desperation.

No smile adorned Greg's weathered face, yet his eyes sparkled with a hint of defiance. ""I've tried it all, Jim,"" he muttered, his voice dripping like a broken water pipe. ""Novelty accounts, memes, well-informed posts filled with information... but I just don't know how to break out.""

I nodded, my heart filled with a mixture of pity and bewilderment. I understood his plight, the torment of not being able to harness the elusive force of karma. My own frustrations echoed in my mind, a symphony of self-doubt and helplessness.

As I sipped my drink, I watched Greg's head bob up and down, his face etched with a deep sadness. No family, no money, no faith. I felt an unsettling kinship with him, a shared understanding of the fragility of life and the cruel randomness of fate.

But then, a glimmer of hope emerged. I knew what I had to do. With a swiftness born of desperation, I pulled out my phone and crafted a message that I knew would elicit the desired reaction. A simple text, yet one that held the promise of salvation.

The words danced across my screen, a prayer offered into the abyss. And to my astonishment, the karma gods conspired to answer my call. The replies poured in, a chorus of gratitude and support. I was drowning in a sea of praise, my heart filled with an overwhelming sense of triumph.

The bar erupted in a symphony of celebration. Greg, his despair dissipated, draped me in his embrace. I was laughing, I was crying, my life a testament to the capricious nature of fate. In that moment, I felt an invincible connection to the world, a sense of purpose I had never experienced before.

"Life feeds life. All living things feast on the lives of others. It is the way of the universe. It is possible to cultivate life, to let it grow, become a larger food source, which many do. So as they expanded and grew, they, too created life. It is also true that created life sometimes acknowledges this, and perceives their creation as divine. They devote their lives to appease this creator, but its their death which does so. 
 
 With each death, the creator is fed. It's all about how one cultivates the life. If unchecked, or done incorrectly, the food can rot, or even attempt to attack its creator. Some food even becomes parasitic, but it all turns out okay in the end. 
 
 This life will grow, and as it reaches the point of becoming too big to contain, then, and only then, will the growth be cut completely, and the creator can have a feast worthy to be called'Divine.'
"," Write in the direct, authoritative tone of a no-nonsense military officer, with a focus on discipline.","Listen up, soldier. Life feeds life. It's the way of the universe, plain and simple. You see, all living things are feeding on the lives of others. It's like a cycle, where you cultivate life, it grows, and then you become a larger food source. And guess what, when you expand and grow, you also create life. It's a no-brainer.

But here's the kicker - when you create life, sometimes you perceive it as divine. You devote your life to appease this creator, but guess what, your death is the ultimate offering. With each death, the creator is fed. It's all about cultivation. If you don't cultivate properly, or if you let things get out of control, the food can rot or even attack its creator. Some food even becomes parasitic, but it all turns out okay in the end.

So, soldier, remember this. Life will grow, and as it reaches the point of becoming too big to contain, then, and only then, will the growth be cut completely, and you can have a feast worthy to be called divine. Now get out there and cultivate that life. But remember, it's all about discipline."

"Bob MacAroy, manager of the accounting department for John ’ s Tricks and Jokes Emporium, called me in. Two days ago the love of his life was taken, somebody had taken his collectible coffee mug. 
 
 The receptionist greeted me, Miss Vaughn. She had legs like spoiled cottage cheese, the smell of cherry filled the air. “ How are you doing handsome? ” 
 
 She was my kind of woman, the kind that liked to be fed. “ I ’ m doing great, now that I ’ ve met you ham hock. ” 
 
 She took a drag on her vape stick. “ Only my boyfriends call me ham hock. ” 
 
 “ And just how many boyfriends do you have? ” 
 
 She blew a cloud of vape juice in my face. “ None right now. ” 
 
 “ I ’ d love to see what ’ s under that mu mu, but I need to talk to Bob. ” I gave her a wink and a coupon for a two for one value meal at McDonald ’ s. 
 
 Miss Vaughn licked her lips, pocketing the coupon. “ We can use this later. ” She pointed down the hallway. “ Bob ’ s two offices down on the left. ” 
 
 Bob ’ s door was open, he sat at his desk solving a Rubix Cube. “ Mr. MacAroy? ” I asked. 
 
 He looked up from his Rubix Cube. “ Who wants to know? ” 
 
 “ I ’ m Tim, here about the missing coffee mug. ” 
 
 He motioned to the chair with an obvious whoopee cushion on it, I picked it up and sat down. “ So, tell me what happened. ” 
 
 Bob stood up and handed me the Rubix Cube. “ A week ago I bought a special mug imported from Africa. It had a coin embedded in it, a coin with the face of… ” He trailed off and looked out the window. “ President Obama. ” 
 
 I wasn ’ t really paying attention, I was engrossed with the Rubix Cube, but my ears perked when he talked about the greatest President to ever grace the world ’ s greatest country. “ What about Obama? ” 
 
 “ The coin had his face on it, a special order from the Bank of Liberia. It even has a certificate of authenticity. ” 
 
 The Rubix Cube fell apart in my hand. “ Sorry. ” 
 
 Bob sat back down. “ Don ’ t worry, it ’ s just a joke Rubix Cube. ” He put his head in his hands. “ That mug was one of a kind. ” 
 
 “ How much was it worth? ” 
 
 “ Almost twenty dollars, not including shipping and handling. ” 
 
 I shook my head. “ That could be quite a lot of money to some people. ” 
 
 “ What can you do? ” 
 
 I crushed the whoopee cushion, the farting sound aroused me. “ Actually, I ’ ve already solved the case, have everybody meet in here in one hour. ” 
 
 After an hour in the bathroom I came back to Bob ’ s office. Miss Vaughn was there, along with an indeterminate number of other people without names or any distinguishing features worth describing. 
 
 Bob stood in front of the group. “ Tim is here to get to the bottom of the theft of my mug. ” He waved me over. “ Go ahead Tim. ” 
 
 I took Tim ’ s place. “ Good afternoon everybody. This will be short and you can get back to your job as Receptionist and whatever it is everybody else does shortly. ” 
 
 “ That ’ s good, I love receiving things, especially from bulging men named Tim, ” Said Miss Vaughn. 
 
 I smirked. “ I know you love taking things Miss Vaughn, because it was you that took Bob ’ s collectible Obama mug. ” 
 
 Everybody gasped, one person fainted, Bob emitted odors. 
 
 Miss Vaughn put her hand to her chest. “ Darling, how can you accuse big old me of such a crime? ” 
 
 “ It is quite simple Miss Vaughn, I reviewed the last ten years of employment of every person that worked here. You have an eight year gap in your resume. ” 
 
 She crossed her arms. “ It ’ s a tough economy. ” 
 
 Out of my trench coat that I was wearing for some reason I produced Miss Vaughan's police record. “ I knew you would say that, because that ’ s exactly what you said when you were arrested eight years ago for theft. ” 
 
 She snorted. “ I don ’ t see what this has to do with Bob ’ s mug. ” 
 
 “ You ’ re right, but you forgot one thing Miss Vaughn. ” 
 
 “ And what ’ s that? ” 
 
 “ The security tape that clearly shows you stealing Bob ’ s mug. In fact I have no idea why Bob didn ’ t look at it in the first place. ” 
 
 Bob got up and stood behind Miss Vaughn. “ I knew it was her the entire time, but I couldn ’ t turn her in, I love her. ” 
 
 “ I have bad news for your Bob. Check her blouse pocket. ” 
 
 He reached in and pulled out the value meal coupon. “ It ’ s just a coupon, so what? ” 
 
 I checked my watch, which would have been more dramatic if I wore one. “ Look at the time, twelve thirty. I gave that coupon to her an hour ago, before lunch. ” 
 
 Bob looked at the coupon, then me, then the coupon, then me, then Miss Vaughn, then the coupon, then the realization hit him. “ Oh my God. ” 
 
 “ That ’ s right Bob, no fat person would ever allow a coupon for food to go unused. You see, Miss Vaughn has a terrible secret she has kept from all of you. ” I paused for dramatic effect. 
 
 “ What ’ s the secret? ” Asked one of the unnamed characters. 
 
 “ I ’ m glad you asked, ” I said, “ Miss Vaughn is actually skinny! ” 
 
 Miss Vaughn leaped from her chair at me like a cat after a brick. Bob and his unknown employees restrained her. “ You just had to come in and ruin everything, ” She said. 
 
 “ And what did he ruin Nancy? ” Asked Bob. 
 
 “ I was going to run away with the janitor, once I had that mug we could go anywhere in the world. ” 
 
 Some cops I had stashed in the hallway carried her away. 
 
 I patted Bob on the back. “ Well Bob, looks like those cops will get some coffee with their doughnuts. ” 
 “ What? ” Asked Bob. 
 
 “ Cops like to eat doughnuts, and she stole a coffee mug. You know, it sounded better in my head. ” 
 
 “ Oh. ” 
 
 I slowly backed out the door of Bob ’ s office. “ Well, that was supposed to be my ending line, so, uh, goodbye. ”

"It's a curious thing, to know that everyone is about the same age, give or take hundred years. Ever since the spiritus drug was released everyone stopped dying. The biggest problem though, was the overpopulation. Even with the moon now colonized, I could not get a simple xbooster without waiting a couple hundred seconds. And, the obvious answer to this problem? stop the newborns, make it a crime. It worked. The penalty was death, if you make a life, you need to give one up. There was a few outcries, a few unsuccessful rallies, mostly from the non existent religious communities, but most people did not care, they allowed a couple of years for any new borns to grow and then enacted the world wide law. 
 
 It's a strange thing, when everyone is about the same age, everyone has been through the same things together, the same problems, the same world wide disasters, all the same. People basically know one another before meeting each other. In a way things have become more stale. People say I'm just looking back at the good old days through rose tinted glasses, that I do n't appreciate where our society has spiraled towards. But I do n't know, I still feel like there is something we are missing. Hidden information between two different beings no longer exists, we can read each others minds. 
 
 Monogamy is mostly dead now, spending your life with the same person was a cool idea, especially when your life lasted no longer than a century, but that's old fashion, we have moved past polygamous relationships now, even augmented interspecies relationships have grown old. The rage now is this global mind that you can jack into and experience emotions with thousands of other individuals. Everyone knows everyone else, we all experience the same things at the same time. There was some novelty to having a memory and processor expansion that was outside of your control, with simple sound waves as the only form of communication, but those inefficient ways became outdated very fast. Traditional Relationships are dead, I am in an intimate relationship with everyone I know. I need nothing else. I need no one else. 
 
 Connection terminated.
", Use the confident and jargon-heavy language of a Wall Street banker.,"It's a curious phenomenon, the homogenous chronology of human existence. Through the advent of the spiritus drug, death has been rendered an elusive concept, albeit at the cost of an overpopulated world. The celestial colonization notwithstanding, the ubiquitous xbooster necessitates an excruciating wait of several hundred seconds, underscoring the magnitude of the problem at hand. The solution, albeit controversial, was crystal clear: cease procreation, make it a crime. The penalty for life, the concomitant surrender of life.

There were outcries, protests, and futile rallies, primarily emanating from the non-existent religious sects, yet the majority remained unmoved. It was an era of collective sacrifice, a solemn decree that demanded a reciprocal exchange. With compassion and foresight, a grace period was afforded for the nascent to flourish, and subsequently, the law was enacted.

However, the homogeneity of age presents a peculiar quandary. It has wrought a sense of sameness, a collective memory shared across generations. The intangible bond forged through shared experiences, the unique intricacies of individual expression, have been eroded. We can now decipher each other's thoughts, but the nuanced interplay between two minds, the unspoken language of unspoken desires, has been extinguished.

Monogamy, once a cherished ideal, has fallen prey to the tides of time. The fleeting intimacy of a century-long partnership pale in comparison to the boundless possibilities afforded by interconnected minds. Polygamy has been superseded, and even augmented interspecies relationships have become outdated. The rage now is this global mind that permeates every individual, a collective consciousness accessible through instantaneous emotional transference.

The advent of instantaneous communication has rendered obsolete the cumbersome rituals of sound waves. The novelty of having a memory and processor expansion that was outside of one's control, the intimate connection forged through shared experiences, has been eclipsed by the pervasiveness of shared consciousness."

"I could rule the world if I wanted to. Be revered by all mankind and be looked at as a God. But I will do none of this. I will not help the world nor will I harm it. I'm not interested in that anymore, I'm not really interested in anything anymore. 
 
 Many people would say I'm selfish for thinking the way I do. Being able to help the entire world, yet I do nothing. I could tell people why I think this way, but they would n't understand. You see I know life is meaningless, I know there's no point or moral to be had. That every action is n't worth the effort. Of course others think this way, but there's a difference between thinking you know and actually knowing. I did n't always have this mind set though. The way I think is a result of the power that was bestowed upon me. One that I did not ask for, and certainly would never want. 
 
 You see when I die, I wake up as my six year old self. You would think it would be amazing. To keep re-living your life doing everything you wished you could have done, but that's not the case. You see it takes away life's meaning. Everyone else's life has meaning, or at least it does to them, and that thought is all I wish I could have. The thought that anything I do has some value. For me everyday is like being trapped in a glass jar with the oxygen slowly running out, but it never does. I can never die no matter how much I want to. 
 
 In the beginning it was different. Life would have been exciting, it would have been enjoyable. To be able to re-live life, correct all stupid things I did, to ask the love of my life out, to work harder and make myself better than I was before. I tried to learn everything I could. From the arts to engineering I wanted to learn it all. 
 
 I would eventually know how to build quantum computers or make sustainable fusion. I would know how to make the cure to cancer and the common cold. I even learned how to create worm holes and transverse entire galaxies in mere seconds. It took a while to learn this of course, I never was the sharpest tool in the box. But when you have lived billions of years you can pretty much learn anything. 
 
 Eventually I could single handedly progress all humanity millions of years ahead of what it should have been. We would land on Mars and have a colony before the 21st century. The whole world would be run by fusion plants by the year 2005. And then there was the way to prolong life, almost infinitely. That's when I made the biggest mistake of my life, to choose willingly to never die, and so I lived for billions of years in a single life. All the way til the universe was starting to end. 
 
 We tried to stop it, we tried practically everything. We even build an entire artifices galaxy just so we could try to survive, but nothing would work. It was then that I learned the truth of life. That everything comes to an end, that life is really meaningless. I then awoke, just as always as a six year old boy in my mothers arms. I looked at her face, a face I had n't seen in almost 30 billion years. This was when my life ended, at that moment. Although I still breath and have a heart beat, I am dead inside.
"," Infuse the narrative with the spirit of the 1920s, including jazz age slang, the glamour of the flapper culture, and post-war optimism.","The roaring twenties roared with the spirit of jazz, the glamour of flapper culture, and the post-war optimism that breathed life into a weary world. Yet, amidst the glitz and the glamour, there was a profound truth that resonated with a solitary soul.

The author's reflections on life and its meaning are steeped in the wisdom of a profound understanding of the fleeting nature of existence. With each breath, he acknowledges the precariousness of his position and the impossibility of leaving a tangible mark on the world. The thought of immortality, which once held promise, now appears as a curse, robbing him of the joy of living a meaningful life.

The author's journey through self-discovery began with a desire to learn, to understand the world and his place within it. He immersed himself in various fields, from the arts to engineering, seeking wisdom and inspiration. Yet, despite his accomplishments, he realized that the pursuit of knowledge alone was not enough. He sought meaning beyond the realm of intellectual pursuits, longing for a connection to others and a sense of purpose in a cosmic dance of creation.

The author's profound understanding of life's impermanence has taught him to appreciate the beauty of each moment, regardless of the circumstances. He recognizes that life is a fleeting experience, a journey through a glass jar with dwindling oxygen. The thought of never dying, while tempting, offers no solace in the face of his inability to leave a lasting impact.

The author's narrative is a testament to the fleeting nature of human existence and the importance of savoring each moment. It is a story of self-reflection, acceptance, and the pursuit of meaning in a world that is ultimately indifferent to our presence."
"I stare at the retreating figure of the witch who had just cursed me. 
 
 I feel the cold spread from the lump of ice now in place of my heart. 
 
 Did she seriously just do this so I ca n't love again? Love does n't create *actual* heat. 
 
 `` Bitch do n't you understand the laws of thermodynamics?'' I shout after her slowly fading form. 
 
 I see a minute shrug as she disappears from my eyeline and give out a weak gurgle as I fall to my knees. As the floor rises to greet my face, it occurs to me that she does n't much understand the laws of biology either.

The only sounds are the clinking of coins in the jukebox and the occasional sigh of a weary patron. I find myself staring at the retreating figure of the witch who had just cursed me. Her voice was sharp as a razor and her eyes burned like molten gold. All I have is a cold lump of ice forming in the place of my heart. Did she really just do this so I can't love again? Love doesn't create actual heat. It just provides a cozy atmosphere for cold, lonely nights.

I yell after her retreating form, ""Bitch, don't you understand the laws of thermodynamics?"" But it's too late. As she fades from sight, I give out a weak gurgle and fall to my knees. As the floor rises to greet my face, I think to myself, she doesn't much understand the laws of biology either. Her beauty was fleeting, like the fragrance of a rose on a hot summer night. But I have a feeling she'll be back, like a spider returning to its web, and I'm not looking forward to it."
"I sat on a chair, too big for my small frame and stared into the dead fireplace. The whisky burned my throat more than usual but it helped me come to terms with what must be done. The plan must succeed. Suddenly, a much younger and disheveled version of me blocked the fireplace. His skin was damp with sweat and his ragged breath bounced off the concrete walls. With hands trembling ever so slightly, he pointed a D-3409 Laser at my head. Confused, I stepped forward. He was here too early, something was wrong. Terribly wrong.

With hands trembling, he pointed a D-3409 Laser at my head. Confused, I took a hesitant step forward. He was there too soon, something was terribly wrong.

"" I'm sorry, "" he whispered, his voice choked with emotion.

And there I sat, helpless and bewildered, as the future unfolded before me."
"You've head the stories. The atheists always dismiss them as control mechanisms to scare the world straight. Satan. The devil. Lucifer and whatnot. Be good or you're heading there. What catechism did n't teach you is that you're heading there regardless. 
 
 It was a Saturday morning down at PandoraCorp. My third month into the job. We're a bit of a stereotype, I'll give you that. Isolated complex, white coats, security that makes North Korea look like a corner store with one of those plastic dummy CCTV cameras. 
 
 I do n't pretend to know everything that's happening. Even at my level, everything is need to know. So when I was given a variety of compounds to experiment with, I did n't ask questions. People disappear here. I've seen enough macabre corporations in movies to hazard a guess at where they've gone. But six figures a year is good money. You can buy anything you want. But you ca n't, no matter how hard you try, rewind time. And believe me, after what happened in that lab, you'd do anything to make it stop. 
 
 Reggie ( I think that's his name, friendly chat is strongly discouraged in PandoraCorp ) was in the large fume cupboard on the other side of the room. He'd closed the glass screen behind him ( standard practice, of course ). I was setting up a titration when the frantic pounding started. The erlenmeyer in my hand fell to the floor, shattering instantly. What can I say? I'm always on edge in here. 
 
 I swivelled around to face Reggie. Or rather, Reggie's corpse. Lifeless, pale, and face forevermore contorted into an expression of pain and raw fear. The other man was smiling, however. Gently rapping on the glass with long, wispy fingers. 
 
 I ca n't tell you how I knew what I was looking at. But when you start to slide out of life and into the beyond, you'll see it too. You'll feel it. 
 
 You know that one childhood memory you have locked up in the back of your mind, that insidious beast clawing and scratching and subtly influencing your day-to-day life? 
 
 Before my very eyes, the long, slender thing's face began to distort. And I found myself looking at my abusive step-father. Nothing in his eyes but the darkest shade of black I've ever seen. 
 
 `` Terrence,'' he smiled. `` Come out to the shed with me.'' 
 
 I could n't hit the panic button meters from me. Cold terror rooted me to the spot. He started to laugh. Hysterically. He laughed and he laughed for what I can only describe as eternity. He laughed and he laughed as he shrunk into Reggie's cadaver. All was quiet eventually. But not before his last words. 
 
 `` The 23rd of February 2037. Bullet to the back of your head. I ca n't wait to get my hands on you again, you fucking little cunt.'' 
 
 That was, if I had to guess, about 15 to 16 years ago. It's hard to tell from inside a padded cell. The boys in the yellow suits came in to find me sobbing hysterically on the floor. They brought me upstairs and I've been here since. No human contact. But at least my step-dad is gone, right? 
 
 My meals get pushed through a little slot in the door. I like to pretend I'm getting mail. It distracts me. 
 
 But when I heard the door opening, I was shocked. Two of the yellow suits were there. The same ones that put me here? I do n't know. Their faces are covered. They hoisted me up without a word. 
 
 Having not left that cell in over a decade, what followed was a bit of a sensory overload as they walked me down a corridor. It was all too much. But for some reason, one detail stuck out as we made our way through PandoraCorp's winding hallways. A fairly basic calendar on the wall. Why this stuck out? 
 
 The date. 
 
 February 23rd. 
 
 And for a second, before they brought me into the killing suite, I swear I could hear that demonic cackling that's haunted me since I was 7. 

"," Use the menacing and crafty language of a fairy tale villain, plotting against the heroes.","Once upon a time, in the shadowy confines of PandoraCorp, a sinister villain named Lucifer emerged from the depths of darkness. With a cunning mind and a wicked heart, he plotted to wreak havoc upon the unsuspecting heroes.

It was a fateful day when Lucifer's reign of terror began. The pungent aroma of chemicals permeated the air, and the sinister sound of a titration gone wrong echoed through the halls of the lab. As he meticulously crafted a concoction, Lucifer's eyes gleamed with anticipation.

With a swiftness that belied his menacing appearance, Lucifer turned his attention to Reggie, a hapless scientist who had inadvertently stumbled upon his evil plot. In a moment of sheer terror, Reggie met his demise as Lucifer's wicked blade pierced through his body.

As the blood flowed down the floor, Lucifer's smile widened, a testament to his diabolical triumph. The remaining heroes stood frozen in fear, their hearts shattered by the sight of their fallen comrade.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, Lucifer's reign of terror continued unabated. He knew that his evil deeds would leave an indelible mark on the world, and he was proud of it.

And so, the tale of Lucifer, the menacing villain, was passed down through generations, serving as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked greed and cruelty."
"The lights rose slowly as I entered the sterile, white room. I sniffed the air; it had the same mixture of cleaning products and that distinctive smell of the elderly. My gaze swept the room, and fell on a small figure wrapped in soft cotton blankets; placed opposite the only window in the room. Already the soft hues of dawn spilled through the panes and gently climbed the walls. 
 
 I strode over to the bedside and sat in an uncomfortable plastic chair. I cleared my throat to signal my arrival, and slowly she opened her eyes. There was confusion in her wild, darting look, until she focused on me and gave a weak smile. 
 
 `` Elder Mendax!'' She croaked. `` I had all but lost hope. I thought perhaps my request yo meet with you had been lost in the bureaucracy.'' She chuckled, as if she had said something clever or funny. In truth, one in three people made some sort of joke along these same lines. I had never made an attempt to correct the system, and never would. It worked the way it had been designed to. 
 
 `` Well, I suppose you know what I am going to request?'' 
 
 I nodded. I kept my face nearly blank, but for a slight grin. That little grin always gave them hope. `` I do know what you want. But you must ask outright, my child.'' 
 
 She nodded back and swallowed hard. `` I want to die. I have been on this earth for so long. So very, very long. I was reckless in my youth. So many injuries. It has been a century since I could go to sleep without powerful pain killers. I beg you, allow my life to end.'' 
 
 I considered her thoughtfully. I watched her expression go from hopeful, to uncertain, to uncomfortable, and finally to anxious. She wanted to speak, wanted me to speak, wanted the nurse to come and break the silence. But no one entered a room while an Elder conducted an interview. And no one spoke until spoken to by an Elder once the interview had begun. It was how it had always been. I absently brushed a speck of dust from my black suit sleeve. 
 
 `` Why do you think death will be better, my child?'' 
 
 So relieved that I had finally spoken, the old woman did not even seem to hear what had been said for a moment. I repeated the question. 
 
 `` Because I have lived my life through. There is nothing left for me here but pain. All I have to look forward to is the sunrise each morning and pain killers each night. I wo n't let my family visit me, they should not see me like this. Yes, death would be better. No more pain.'' She smiled sweetly. Ever so sweetly. No doubt thinking of the sweet release she expected from death. 
 
 My grin widened slightly. `` And what makes you think there will be no pain in death?'' She blinked at me blankly. `` Tell me child, when were you born? How long after the cure for aging?'' 
 
 `` Before it, actually. I was six when the cure was found.'' 
 
 `` Then you no doubt recall religion. What were you raised as my child?'' 
 
 Confusion was beginning to fix itself in the lines on her leathery face. `` Baptist. My family was n't very observant.'' 
 
 `` What do you recall of the afterlife?'' 
 
 `` Well.'' She hesitated. I could smell the fear on her. That smell always came when I reminded them of the old teachings. They all pretended they never believed it. Or if they had, that they certainly were going somewhere nice. 
 
 `` Heaven for the good, hell for the bad,'' she stated simply. 
 
 `` And what is hell like?'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry, Elder Mendax, what does this have to do with anything?'' 
 
 My eye smiled with my lips now. `` You toke the cure for aging. Tried to play God. What makes you think he will welcome you into his home now? Why should he when you tried to cheat him?' 
 
 Her hands groped. Her lips twitched and her eyes darted this way and that. `` But, it was all just stories. Everyone knows there is not heaven.'' She hesitated. `` No hell. Why, you helped create the cure!'' 
 
 I laughed now. Roared with laughter. `` Oh yes. I certainly did. Gave it to you all for free too. And no one ever questioned why. Well, some did. But they were purged easy enough before doubt could be sown. They did n't escape me in the end anyway. They are still mine.'' 
 
 Her frail body shook. `` Who are you.'' 
 
 My eyes flashed at her, filled with unholy anger, and she shrunk away as best she could. `` You know damned well who I am.'' She managed a whimper. Nothing more. `` I have approved your request. They gave you the dosage in your IV before I ever came in the room.'' I glanced at my obsidian watch. `` You have maybe twenty minutes left.'' 
 
 I stood and walked to the door. Before leaving, I glanced back over my shoulder and grinned at her. `` See you soon.'' 
 
 As I left, the old woman began to sob. A nurse dashed in to comfort her. 
 
 The nurse paused a moment in the door, sniffing the air. There was something different about the smell. It reminded her of something. putting it in the back of her mind, she rushed to the old woman's side. There was nothing she could do for her. The decision of an Elder was final. But she stroked the old woman's hair and told her it was alright. 
 
 *Hawaii* The nurse thought. The smell reminded her of her vacation to see the volcanoes in Hawaii. Absently, before putting the now dissipated smell out of her mind forever, one final word came to mind. *Brimstone. *

I stared at her for a moment, then sighed. ""Perhaps. But I am not the one to judge. You have lived a long life, and it is time for you to move on.""

She nodded, her eyes closed. ""Thank you, Elder. I am grateful for your time.""

I stood up and turned to leave. As I walked away, I thought about the woman's life. It was a long one, filled with both joy and sadness. And now, it was time for her to move on."

She did n't even hear Danny's voice above the din, though she knew it was there just as she knew his silence once things settled. She just started screaming at Danny's troopmate to leave. She tried to sound as mean as she could, hoping it would save him from trying to save her. It worked and he ran.

"`` Oh shit oh shit oh shit'' Nothing but that streaming through my head over and over again. I ran to the bathroom and stared into the mirror. There was no doubt about it, we definitely had the same face. Maybe I was seeing things again. I'd hallucinated before, but I was better now. 
 
 I ran back to the body, my heart still pounding, that chorus still ringing through my head. `` oh shit oh shit oh shit''. No doubt, that was me lying there. And above him, was myself, staring down at his lifeless face. 
 
 I'm pretty sure I fainted after that, because the next thing I knew, I was lying face to face with him, it... What ever. 
 
 I sprang to my feet, all the while my mind spewing out that one line `` oh shit oh shit oh shit''. 
 
 There was no way this was happening. A person ca n't just find themselves dead. One more time I examined his sad looking face, and then again, mine in the mirror. Though my visage was a lot more perplexed and terrified, they were certainly identical. 
 
 I staggered over to the kitchen, taking the route that went furthest from the atrocity that lay on my rug. I poured myself a glass of Jack and calmed my nerves a little bit. Suddenly a sinister idea popped into my head. I double checked the calender just to make sure. I was right, It was April 1st. 
 
 I grabbed the bottle and put it next to the body, trying to avoid looking at it too much. His beady black eyes, just staring into nothing... What was he thinking before he died I wondered. I snapped back into the land of the living when I realized that I was standing in a puddle of alcohol. No matter, It would add to the effect. 
 
 I ran to the medicine cabinet. There was n't much. Some Advil, some aftershave, I think there was some antibiotics. I kept rummaging through it. I found an unopened bottle of Tylenol! I poured maybe a handful of pills into the toilet and flushed them down. 
 
 I ran back over to the body and placed the respective bottles in his hands and spilled both their contents around a little. 
 
 I looked down at the scene and got a little bit of a chill. Was I really about to do this? Prank or not, this was messed up. Before I could think about it any longer I grabbed my phone and dialed my mom's number. 
 
 She picked up after a few rings. 
 
 `` I'm sorry mom, I just ca n't do it anymore'' Using my past hour's turmoil as inspiration. My performance was pretty good if I do say so myself. 
 
 `` I love you'' I finished and hung up. 
 
 I grabbed another hefty swig of alcohol and hid in the closet. 
 
 Twenty minutes passed before anything happened, but when it did, it was like a hurricane. 
 
 My mom burst in with the police. She was wailing. She clutched me in her arms and screamed. 
 
 After a little bit I decided now was the time. 
 
 I pushed the closet doors open with a big smirk on my face. 
 
 `` APRIL FOOLS!!'' I screamed at the top of my lungs. Her expression was priceless. That'll teach her to post my baby pictures online! 
 
 The last thing I remember before it going dark was that frantic chorus chiming through my head again `` Oh shit oh shit oh shit!'' as my mom ran at me with a frying pan.

I ran to the body, my heart pounding in my chest. He was dead. There was no doubt about it. I stared at his lifeless face, and I felt a wave of sadness. But I also felt a sense of anger. How could someone do this to another person? Why was he so cruel?

"It began with the first industrial revolution, though it was n't obvious then. No, with the ability to mass produce guns and later other armaments, the advent of industry seemed fortuitous to say the least. Where thousands had fallen historically, no millions would fall. He gloried it it. The advent of guns, then automatic guns, grenades, tanks, aircraft, all manner of mechanisms to take life. And with each death, he grew strong. Stronger than he'd ever been. Strong enough, perhaps, to ascend to the top of the pantheon. Nuclear weapons were the pinnacle. The destruction they wrought in the mid 21st century was greater than all wars previous. 
 
 Yet, with the diminished population, conflict staggered. There were nought but small local skirmishes. Then, as human society began to rebuild in areas relatively unaffected, something horrible happened. The same technologies that had been used to creat weapons of destruction were used to create small oases of plenty. When newcomers came to these places, there was enough to share. As time went on, the oases expanded and more and more were granted access to plenty. The small skirmishes came less and less frequently. Finally, in the 24th century, the last recorded `` war'' if it could even be called that ended. War was, now, and perhaps forever, only known to history. 
 
 He watched it all in horror. The strength he'd gained in the heyday of human conflict and suffering ebbed quickly. Finally, sometime in the 25th century, alone and forgotten, Ares breathed his last.
"," Rewrite this as if it were a monologue from a Shakespeare play, using Elizabethan language and iambic pentameter.","O, the cruel hand of fate, hath wrought a tale of destruction and rebirth,
A saga of the human spirit, a tale etched in the earth.
It began with guns, a scourge of war,
And the ability to take life, a cruel allure.
With each death, strength grew,
Until the pinnacle of destruction was reached,
Nuclear weapons, a scourge of death and fear,
And the destruction wrought in the mid-21st year.

Yet, with the diminished population, conflict waned,
And small local skirmishes became the norm.
As society rebuilt, oases bloomed,
And newcomers shared their bounty, the strife was consumed.
The oases expanded, and access was gained,
And war, once a scourge, became a distant stain."
"I'm quite late to this, not sure if it will even get read but here goes... 
 
 It was 7:15 on a lousy evening in Jindabyne as Sean drove along the dark, icy road. This winter had been particularly cruel to Sean; fewer people had been staying at his lodge which forced him to cut the cleaning staff. Sean had been struggling to run the lodge and clean it. He felt he deserved some fun, something to fill him with such satisfaction and happiness. Driving along the road, he smiled. “ Where are you? ” he muttered. As he drove around a bend, there she was. She was young, probably around 21. Her blonde hair blew to one side in the wind. She was clinging on to her backpack and stood stiff like a post with one arm out. “ There you are. ” Sean said blissfully. There she was. Sean pulled up the fixed blade in his boot, just touching it made his heart race. He pulled to the side of the road and opened the door. “ Do ya need a lift, love? ” He yelled over the wind. She stared at him, Sean worried he had already scared her, she ’ s so small and helpless he thought. “ I can call you a taxi but you might be waiting a while. ” With that she gathered her things and got in the front seat. They sat in silence for a while, Sean was trying to be patient, he didn ’ t want to seem too eager but he had been longing for this for quite some time. It had been almost 8 months since his last kill and 8 months wasn ’ t enough to suffice. “ You know where you ’ d like to go? ” He pushed. She turned to him and he almost groaned when he saw her sad, grey eyes. “ I ’ m hungry. ” She stated. So am I Sean thought. “ Alright, well I can take you into town? Get you a nice hearty meal, what do ya say? ” Sean said in fatherly voice. The girl nodded. For the first few minutes Sean and the girl said nothing. Sean was excited, too excited. He could smell her lavender shampoo and it was driving him crazy. He kept thinking of what her name might be, how when the moment that she told him her name, he would never forget it. She was his now, no one else ’ s. “ How long will it take to get there? ” the girl asked, interrupting Sean ’ s train of thought. “ About 35 minutes give or take ” Sean said, smiling. Make her feel safe he thought I want her to feel safe. A few more minutes passed until Sean could take no more silence. Who are you, where are you from, why are you here? He thought. He had to know. “ I ’ m Sean by the way… ” He said, indicating a response. The girl nodded politely and looked outside the window. “ And your name is? ” He pushed on. “ Amity ” she replied, still looking outside the window. Amity! Oh Amity, Amity! You will make me a happy man. “ That ’ s a beautiful name, Amity. ” She turned her head and smiled wryly “ I ’ ve always hated it actually. I plan to change my name one day ” she said as she began to play with her bracelet. “ What would you change it to then? ” Sean asked, almost in flirtatiously. “ Jane ” she said with a pause. “ Plain Jane, that ’ s the name for me ” she said sweetly. I love you Sean thought. How can I love you, if I want to kill you? “ Well, I like either of them. They both suit you ” Sean replied, now feeling uneasy about what the night held for him. What was happening to him? How could he even feel like this? I will go through with this, it ’ s what I want, it ’ s what I need! He told himself. He began to struggle to find himself, he looked at his watch, ten minutes had passed, and he needed to get going if he wanted this to happen. Just before he went to ask her a question she got a flask out of her backpack. She looked at him and smiled. “ I ’ m not a big drinker but I find this warms me up. ” She went to take a swig but then paused “ Sorry, I ’ m so rude. Would you like some? ” She said her eyes still so sad. I love you, I love you, I love you! Sean sang to himself. Maybe a drink will help? I have to go through with this! “ Sure, why not? ” Sean said shrugging casually. He took three decent gulps and handed it back. “ Bottoms up ” She said, smiling at him in such a way that made him feel sick. Sean took a road taking them further from town, unbeknownst to Amity. Not long now my sweet Amity, I ’ ll make it as painless as possible He thought. “ You live by yourself? ” Amity asked. Sean nodded; he didn ’ t want to continue talking. The more she spoke, the weaker he became. “ Mmm solitude is bliss ” Amity said softly. “ I never understood that meaning up until about three years ago. I moved out from my mothers, went to another state and have been by myself ever since. It really is pure bliss, isn ’ t it? ” She said. He couldn ’ t take much more; she was perfect, just perfect. I want solitude with you and your lavender scent he thought achingly. “ Do you ever get lonely? ” she asked, pushing for a conversation. Sean cleared his throat, “ Sometimes, yes. Do you? ” he asking, trying to remain calm. “ Mainly on cold nights ” she said, staring at him. Sean lost all the moisture in his mouth while his forehead began to feel clammy. “ It ’ s especially cold tonight ” she said, now moving closer to him. Sean felt ill and started to feel his body turn limp. I can ’ t do this, this isn ’ t right! I can ’ t even control my body! Sean began to pull over in to an abandoned warehouse drive way. “ What are you doing? ” She said in a panicked voice. Sean turned to her and smiled sheepishly. “ I ’ m sorry that I have to do this, Amity, sweet Amity ” he said, struggling to get the words out. Then when he went for his fixed blade tucked in his boot, his whole body fell to one side. Sean was now pushed up against the driver ’ s door, he tried to grab the knife again but couldn ’ t, his arms had given way. What is happening? Sean screamed to himself. He began to panic. She ’ s going to get away! What if she goes to the police? Sean thought. He was then interrupted by Amity laughing. He tried to turn his head but couldn ’ t. She then moved his body in the centre of the seat and sat on top of him. He was confused. What was she doing? Why wasn ’ t she running? She then followed his hand and found the blade. She showed him the blade and shook her head at him mockingly. “ Now that ’ s not very friendly, is it? ” She said. He tried to scream but only managed to grunt loudly. “ Hey hey hey, Sean, there ’ s no need to be dramatic. ” She said while she stroked his hair. Sean started to lose consciousness, he tried to fight it. “ You know, I almost didn ’ t go through with this. You seemed like such a lovely guy. But then again, I ’ ve never had much willpower. ” She said as she continued to stroke his hair and hush him like a loving mother to her newborn child. Will I ever see you again sweet Amity? Sean thought to himself. Amity then presented her own blade and held it to Sean ’ s throat. Just before he lost consciousness Amity put her mouth to his ear and whispered “ You ’ re mine now. ”
"," Describe the setting as a post-apocalyptic world, focusing on survival, the collapse of society, and the resilience of humanity.","The desolate wasteland stretched endlessly beyond the crumbling remnants of what once was a vibrant society. The once lush landscape had been ravaged by a catastrophic event, leaving behind only barren hills and withered vegetation. The sky was perpetually shrouded in a thick blanket of ash, cast a sickly yellow hue upon the barren earth.

In this unforgiving world, survival was a constant battle. Resources were scarce, and the threat of danger lurked around every corner. The collapse of society had left humanity reeling, and the resilience of the human spirit was tested. Yet, amidst the destruction, there were stories of hope and perseverance.

Sean, a solitary lodge owner, had carved out a niche for himself in this harsh environment. His lodge, once a beacon of warmth and hospitality, now stood as a testament to his resilience. With each passing day, Sean fought to survive, and his determination was contagious.

One fateful evening, as Sean drove along a desolate road, he encountered a young woman, her backpack a lifeline in the wind. Her eyes, as vast as the sky above, mirrored the fiery sunset. With a smile on his face, Sean offered her a lift, knowing that the journey could lead to unexpected adventures.

As they rode together, the girl's sadness was palpable. She spoke of her hunger and longing for a place to call home. Sean, a man of compassion, understood her plight and offered her shelter in his lodge. It was a simple gesture, yet it filled the girl with gratitude.

In the aftermath of the storm, Sean and the girl stood amidst the ruins of the old world, their resilience a beacon of hope. The wasteland stretched before them, but their spirits were unbroken. Their story, a testament to the enduring strength of humanity, echoed through the desolate landscape, leaving a trail of inspiration for all to follow."
"My head felt very fuzzy, sitting up straight with my hand on my head. I started to cough, and breathing felt difficult. My vision started coming back. I see darkness but a small light source revealing everything. I'm in a small metal room, and sitting across me is a girl. Looks like she's in her 20s. 
 
 `` Finally awake?'' She asked me. 
 
 I did n't respond, still feeling nauseous. I shook my head to wake myself up. Replying with a simple nod. I then asked her. 
 
 `` Where are we?'' 
 
 `` We're in the last safe room of the ship, the oxygen in the ship suddenly malfunctioned-'' 
 
 `` Wait ship? Oxygen malfunction?!'' I interrupted her, I do n't remember being on a ship. My memory felt hazy, I ca n't recall anything. Not even my name... 
 
 `` I was getting to that, our ship hit an asteroid on our voyage across the solar system. The asteroid made a dent on or ship, damaging our oxygen reserves. Everyone else is dead. Just us left.'' 
 
 I sat in awe, why have I forgot about being in this predicament, more importantly why have I forgotten my life? Suddenly my head hurt a lot, I placed both my hands on my head while clenching my teeth. Wait my name... I'm Ethan... And I'm 22 years old... 
 
 I remember! We were on a 2 year voyage across the solar system. Gathering samples for something... My memory only reached that far. I also remembered he girl's name, Emily. 
 
 `` Hey you ok?'' Emily asked. 
 
 `` Yea... Just some headaches that's all.'' I lied. 
 
 We both fell silent, I looked around the room. Wait if an asteroid hit us. Should n't there be no gravity? Then why are n't we floating? Ok do n't tell me she's lying? I looked at the door, it's not fully closed! Should n't we be dead by now from oxygen deprivation, or die from the vacuum of space? I looked at Emily, she's sleeping. Probably from being tired. 
 
 Now is my chance, I clicked the button that opens the door. It slid open, I quickly checked on Emily who's still sleeping. I tiptoed out and I heard a splat when I placed my shoes on the ground. I looked and saw a corpse.... 
 
 Wait why is he bleeding from his throat? This is incredibly strange. Placing my hand on the corpse my head hurts again, but this time I groaned loudly from the pain. 
 
 Wait that person is Kyle... Oh god, no Emily lied about almost everything. Everyone was killed by another crew member! But my memory would n't tell me who. 
 
 Just then footsteps come rushing towards me, I turned and Emily pushed me towards the floor. She raised her hand up with clutching a knife. 
 
 `` I would've spared you if you did n't waltz out of there.'' 
 
 I managed to kick her back, she dropped and I quickly got up. Disarming her with ease. I pushed the knife but she use her hands to block me. She pushed me back and I let go of the knife. I quickly got up and ran down the ship's hallway. 
 
 After some running I reached the cockpit, I quickly pressed the button to lock the door. I dropped to the floor in exhaustion, and I started to hear footsteps running around the hallway. She's crazy! 
 
 Scanning the cockpit, it's not very big. But it has five seats and some control modules and etcetera. 
 
 I walked towards the captain's seat. There sat the corpse of Captain James. I prayed for his soul, picked the body up and dropped it on the floor. I sat on the seat and placed my fingers on each of the handles. Then the sound of a computer came up. 
 
 `` Please verify yourself.'' It said. 
 
 `` Crew member Ethan Heather.'' 
 
 `` Attention, private video authorised to be played.'' 
 
 A screen popped up in front of me, it's Captain James bleeding from his stomach. 
 
 `` Hey Ethan, by now you probably escaped from that madwoman, listen I made videos for each crew member, allowing them control of the ship's AI. I exclude Emily for obvious reasons, but once the video finishes the ship will cryogenically freeze anyone in the cockpit. The ship will be set to head straight for Earth at maximum speed, and everywhere except the cockpit will be deprived of oxygen, surely killing Emily except you. I'm probably a goner, but Ethan, your one of the best crew mates we can ever have. Saving our ass twice already. Hope you survive man, say hi to Jennifer for me.'' 
 
 The video ends and tears ran down my eyes. The AI started speaking again. 
 
 `` Attention, releasing cryogenic substance into the cockpit. Oxygen reserves are cut off from the ship except the cockpit.'' 
 
 I closed my eyes. Feeling the incredibly cold air around me. I ca n't wait to be out of here.
"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","My head, as a vessel of consciousness, felt fuzzy as I sat upright, my hand resting upon my head. Coughing and breathing labored, my vision began to coalesce from the abyss of darkness. The light that pierced through the encroaching shadows revealed my surroundings, a small metal room, and the seated figure of a young woman. Her age, estimated to be in her late twenties, mirrored the vibrancy of her smile.

""Finally awake?"" she inquired, her voice gentle as a melody.

I remained silent, my head throbbing in protest. My nausea persisted, and my memory, as hazy as smoke, struggled to recall the events leading to this precarious situation. The name of the ship, the malfunctioning oxygen reserves, and the catastrophic asteroid strike all escaped me. My mind was a blank canvas, devoid of the pigments of recollection. Not even my own name escaped me.

""Where are we?"" I whispered, my voice barely a whisper.

""We're in the last safe room of the ship,"" she replied, her voice tinged with urgency. ""The oxygen in the ship suddenly malfunctioned.""

""Wait, ship? Oxygen malfunction?!?"" I interrupted, disbelief etched into my voice. My memory was a fragmented mosaic, devoid of the anchoring threads of context. The events that had led me to this point were distant and elusive, like smoke escaping into the wind.

She continued, her voice unraveling the grim tale. ""Our ship hit an asteroid on our voyage across the solar system. The asteroid made a dent on our ship, damaging our oxygen reserves. Everyone else is dead. Just us left.""

I sat there, my mind reeling from the sheer magnitude of loss and the precariousness of existence. Why had I forgotten my life? Why had I forgotten the events that had led me to this moment? The pain in my head intensified, and I pressed both my hands against my head, my teeth clenched in agony. My name... Ethan... I am 22 years old...

I remember! We were on a two-year voyage across the solar system, collecting samples for... I cannot recall the purpose. My memory only reached that far. I also remembered the girl's name, Emily.

""Hey you ok?"" she asked, her voice concern etched into her tone.

""Yea... Just some headaches that's all,"" I lied, my voice weak.

We fell silent, the silence punctuated only by my incessant thoughts. I looked around the room, my gaze searching for answers. Wait, if an asteroid hit us, shouldn't there be no gravity? Then why are we not floating? Ok, do not tell me she's lying. I looked at the door, it's not fully closed. Should n't we be dead by now from oxygen deprivation, or die from the vacuum of space? I looked at Emily, her sleep undisturbed. Probably from being tired.

Now is my chance, I thought to myself, my mind alight with a desperate determination. I clicked the button that released the door, and it slid open. I rushed to check on Emily, her sleep undisturbed. I tiptoed out, my footsteps echoing through the hall. I heard a splash, and my heart skipped a beat."
"No one was surprised. 
 
 It might have been the seperation that did it. Mitchell, one of the earliest, one of the finest, said it best: `` You develop an instant global consciousness.'' he said. `` From out there,'' he said `` international politics seem so petty''. 
 
 It was strange, the pall the past cast on the present, even thousands of years ago, you could hear his words, as he said them, pressed into holes of silica or beams of light, and no one was surprised, really, that the claustrophobic, crowded powderkeg of pressurized records was gone. 
 
 How had it gone? Too many options, really. A containment failure at a zero-point energy plant, where another universe came spilling out of a pinhole we made? Grey goo, returning our golden work to base metal? Atomics, then? Nuclear birds coming home to roost? 
 
 Or war? 
 
 No, not war, not any longer. Peace was a blown glass vase, brimming with poison, and guarded by stern humorless men. There could be no change, *would* be no change. Thousands of years of history, carefully preserved, saw to that. 
 
 `` Look at what happened when that was tried!'' they say, the washed-grey men say, `` This happened, and we still have the photos of the bombs, the videos of the children, blistered from the gas! Here, let's look at those. We will play them, on a loop, until you slink away in hot shame for trying to change what we have now.'' This peace, the peace of a man in a minefield, surrounded by pictures of every misstep. 
 
 So nothing could change, and nothing would. Earth remained, as perfectly motionless as a tightrope walker who just felt the line quiver. 
 
 And some chose to leave. To walk away. 
 
 They were the stupid kids. The idiots. The half-baked. And they quietly built their rockets, called Apollo out of tradition, in homage to Mitchell, a saint, they decided, even though the idea of saints was laughable, because he had tried to fly before the wings really even existed. They left at night. They left everything, for the fresh silence of space. They transmitted back, an afterthought, really, as a sop to those who still loved them, the heartbeat of their lonely metal box. 
 
 And they listened, and heeded, but only barely, to the flickers behind them as they hurtled away. 
 
 The first radio transmission occurred in 1880. That meant that there was a wall of transmissions more than 7000 light-years wide rushing out, pouring into the gaps between the stars, the second Great Deluge drowning the'sinful' celestial quiet, crowding out the x-rays with self-referential ( *reverential? * ) chattering. 
 
 When they passed it, Earth was gone. Only their lonely heartbeat remained. And Earth was gone. Nothing on the ansible, nothing cobwebbing their antennas, and in the deepest of ironies, in the void of that endless dark, in their metal box, they breathed deeply. 
 
 It was their future now. 

"," Write as though you were a medieval peasant, with period-appropriate language and a focus on daily survival.","No one was surprised. The world had ended, and the present was clouded by the past. The memories of the old times, like the stench of decay, lingered in the air. As I pressed my ears against the cold earth, I could hear Mitchell's words, as if they were echoes from the past, reverberating through my mind.

It was strange, the pall the past cast on the present. Thousands of years ago, it seemed as if I could hear his words, pressed into holes of silica or beams of light. The claustrophobic, crowded powderkeg of pressurized records had been gone for a long time. The world had been a canvas, and now it was only a faded photograph, a memory.

No one was surprised that the world had ended. It had been a long journey, a journey filled with both joy and sorrow. The world had been a beautiful place, and it was a tragedy that it had been destroyed. But there was no point in dwelling on the past. The future was ahead, and it was full of possibilities.

So I looked to the sky, and I saw the stars. I felt the wind blowing through my hair, and I felt the warmth of the sun on my face. I was alive, and I was grateful."
"`` Just a little further'' Stasi said as they walked through the forest. Miyakel was breathing hard, half from the quick pace his sister kept, half from fear of the unknown. Their father told them to stay away from this place; that a powerful wizard put a poisonous spell from all who entered. Normally they would heed papa's advice, but when the Smif sisters called them cowards them at school on Godday, he and his sister were compelled to travel here to save face from embarrassment. 
 
 They pass over a creak, and Stasi warned her sibling to not drink from it. `` We do n't know how the wizard poisons people who come here, but it's best to avoid eating or drinking anything.'' Miyakel dreaded the thought of getting sick and having to reveal the truth to father, so he resisted the urge to quench his thirst. 
 
 Their path was overgrown, but manageable. The ground was more covered than the roads in their town, but was too straight to be a coincidence. It was obvious, even to a child, that this once was created by people as a passage way for many folk. He envisioned a time when it was clear and large caravans traveled through this area in horses and carriages down this road. 
 
 Suddenly his sister put her hand out on his shoulder, and became instantly silent. Miyakel froze, worried that they had come across something sinister. Slowly, she pointed with her other hand. The young boy slowly followed with his eyes until he saw it. A metal pole, twice the his height with a sign on it. Metal was rare, and never used for such a luxury as a sign. 
 
 The writing was grey and dirty, but somehow Miyakel knew at one time they were colorful, that time had eroded all the brilliance the sign once had. He could n't read the ancient text, some of the letters were clear like ( CBL ), while other appears backward ( R ) or upside down ( A ). Nonetheless the sounds he could construct from it made no sense to him. 
 
 However, he was transfixed by the symbol. It was a triangle, with what appeared to be a circle. However the circle was an illusion. It was circle but every other 1/6 was missing. Additionally the center was showing, but a ring around the center was also removed. Something had made this sign, and it did so very deliberately. Although he had never seen it before, this symbol was foreboding. His mind was fearful of the alien design. 
 
 Miyakel held his sister's hand and tilted his head back toward the village. He had seen enough and wanted to go home. Mother would be making a fresh batch of bread, and they still had firewood to gather for the stove. Stasi apparently felt the same. This was as far as they were willing to go. However she pulled out some paper and the piece of sharpened coal that father had gotten her from last Spring's carnival. She copied what she saw, hoping that one day she could make sense of the sign. After she finished, he watched her carefully open her satchel and place in it the paper that read: `` WARNING CHERNOBYL AHEAD.''

"Magical schools of North America, an overview. 
 
 There are four main magical schools in the North American continent. The Salem Witches Institute ( SWI ) is the eastern most of the schools. Located in an unplotable dimensionally shifted area somewhere in Massachusetts, it is the oldest and most traditional of the magical schools. It is a female only school and is home to no less than thirteen covens and seven secret sects. The school specializes in ancient druidic and fertility rituals, traditional potions, medicinal magic, and long lasting hexes and vicious curses; many of which are primarily directed against the male genitalia. 
 
 Its counterpart, Miskatonic University of Arcane Studies, has switched over to a co-ed arrangement as recently as 1869. Located in the notice-me-notted town of Arkham, Massachusetts, the campus features excellent accelerated studies in demonology, soul magic, necromancy, and Things-mankind-was-never-meant-to-know ( as well as Advanced Things-mankind-was-never-meant-to-know ). Notable alumni include Gomez and Fester Addams, architect Ivo Shandor, and Johnathan Horace Tobin, author of Tobin's Spirit Guide. 
 
 In the Midwest region, there is the Thunderbird College of Conjuration. The school's location is constantly in flux as its campus consists of an enchanted flying citadel. Founded by a group of four wizards and witches who felt that neither Miskatonic nor Salem offered enough defensive studies, the Thunderbird College specializes in producing some of the best war wizards, battle mages, and curse-breakers in the world. Specialties include Offense against the Dark Arts, Skin-walking ( animagus studies ), Voodoo and You, and Advanced Shamanistic rituals. 
 
 Finally, on the west coast, there lies the California Institute of Technomancy; the newest magical school as of these writings. Located in the magical town of Silicon City, the school's advanced classes focus on seamlessly blending magic and technology, or as the students call it, `` Science!''. Much of the recent advances in spell crafting and potion making has taken place in this school. Unfortunately, safety measures and policy have fallen behind the rapid advancement of everything else. In any given year, as much as a third of the campus population will become injured due to experiments gone rouge. Specialties at the school include Magitec Device Assembly, Advanced Golem construction, Experimental Artificing, and C++ plus Magic; hacking the world around you.
"," Craft a text in the style of a Christie mystery, with intrigue, clever plotting, and a twist ending.","Magical schools of North America, an overview.

There are four main magical schools in the North American continent. The Salem Witches Institute (SWI) is the easternmost school, shrouded in mystery, and steeped in tradition. It is the oldest and most prestigious of the schools, but also the most dangerous, with its notorious hexes and vicious curses.

Its counterpart, Miskatonic University of Arcane Studies, has a more balanced approach. Located in the quaint town of Arkham, Massachusetts, it offers a wide range of courses in demonology, soul magic, necromancy, and the dark arts. While not as dangerous as SWI, Miskatonic has its own share of challenges, particularly its accelerated studies in the dark arts.

In the Midwest, there is the Thunderbird College of Conjuration, renowned for its defensive studies. With its enchanted flying citadel, the school is constantly on the move, offering a unique blend of offensive and defensive magic. Students at Thunderbird College specialize in war wizards, battle mages, and curse-breakers, making them formidable forces against the forces of darkness.

Finally, on the west coast, there lies the California Institute of Technomancy, the newest magical school as of these writings. Located in the magical town of Silicon City, the school is a pioneer in the field of technomancy, blending magic with technology. Students at the Institute of Technomancy create innovative tools and gadgets, empowering them to harness the power of both magic and technology.

However, the seemingly idyllic facade of the four schools masks a sinister secret. It is known that the hexes and curses emanating from SWI have been targeting male genitalia, leading to widespread speculation that the school is engaged in a targeted campaign of revenge against men. This unsettling truth casts a shadow over the legacy of the Salem Witches Institute, leaving the future of male members of the magical community uncertain."
"`` It's almost tomorrow.'' 
 
 Dazed and quickly losing all bearing, I weakly grip the wet slimy bark of the tree and steady myself as I settle down on the muddy grass. Blood trails down my forehead into my eyes, stinging them, and starts to drop on the ground. 
 
 The sparkling weightless drizzle continues to persist. 
 
 `` Tomorrow. What's that?'' Hodie says completely serious. He still stands, watching, from here, the brightly lit plains below us. Watching the smoke rise high above the vicious flames. Joining in with the clouds. 
 
 Lazily, I turn to face him with my one good eye. After all the things that I have learned that Hodie is yet to learn about, this is the most surprising of them. It is also the most disheartening. It means he is just a day old and the gargyl never intended that he last more than that. 
 
 Letting out a sigh, I raise my face to the heavens welcoming the painful touch of the slightly acidic rain as it burned my wounds. 
 
 `` It's all the hope that we have.'' I finally get myself to croak out, with great difficulty, my neck has n't completely healed. 
 
 `` So we *do* have something.'' He says mirroring my first words to him `` I look forward to this.'' 
 
 For the first time, since the Jun dropped, I think I do too.

You've got the scent of smoke and burning flesh in the air, and the earth beneath your feet is slick with mud. I'm feeling a little dazed and helpless, but I've found a spot to settle down and soak it all in.

He's got a look on his face that says, ""What's that?"" It's a question that echoes through the night, a question that only a few of us can answer.

I turn to face him, my one good eye searching his. There's a lot I've learned from Hodie, but the most important thing is this - life is fleeting, and it's not always fair. It means that he's just a day old, and the cruel hand of fate has already written his goodbye.

But I find solace in the fact that we do have hope, no matter what. We have the power to find beauty in the midst of tragedy. So I raise my face to the heavens, welcoming the pain and the rain, and croak out a sigh, ""It's all the hope that we have.""

And Hodie, he turns to me with a smile, ""I look forward to this."" For the first time, since the Jun dropped, I think I do too.

So let's all join together and celebrate the sweet gift of life, no matter the circumstances. May the future be bright, folks. May the future be bright. And I'll be back on the airwaves tomorrow, with another story to spin. Until then, good night, folks. And sweet dreams."""
"during college I studied psychology, was never particularly good at it but it was always interesting and the lecturers were pretty cool. 
 
 Well anyway we got on to memory and the schema; sweet we get to do an experiment where we hook someone up to an actual polygraph and try to fool their memory with a loaded interview. Now 17 year old me is super excited by all of this so when the lecturer asks for a volunteer I'm absolutely the first hand in the air. 
 
 So I go ahead and wander down the front and get strapped in and sticky padded up... nope, no connection, no pulse, no activity, nothing. Obviously the machine is broken most of the college kit is old and pretty janky anyway. So we fall back on the analogue blood pressure meter and someone taking my pulse with their hand. 
 
 Well long story short they could n't get anything either and when they plug the next person into the polygraph it bursts into life. 
 
 [ Probably terribly written but also non fiction which earns it some merit right? Also anyone know why I appear dead on polygraph /do n't set the burglar alarm off at home without waving at it/ have to ask strangers to open automatic doors for me? ]

The lectures were cool, but my skills were subpar. Nevertheless, I was captivated by the subject and eager to embark on a journey into the realm of memory and schema.

As the lecturer's voice reverberated through the hall, I couldn't contain my excitement when he requested a volunteer. With lightning speed, I shot my hand up, my enthusiasm rivaling that of a turbo-charged neural implant. I was strapped in, sticky pads adorning my skin, but alas, there was no connection, no pulse, no activity. The machine was broken, a testament to the antiquated nature of the college equipment. We reverted to the archaic blood pressure meter and a manual pulse reading.

The experiment yielded nothing, and as I watched the next person be hooked up, the polygraph burst into life. It was a surreal moment, one that illustrated the capricious nature of fate and the fleeting nature of memory.

"Hey man, so disregarding your grammatical errors and phrasing in some instances, I think that your writing is good. You do pretty well at describing sequences and are good at avoiding redundancies. You definitely have potential. As far as story goes, you show creativity, but I think that the metaphor one was a little bit weak. That prompt gave the potential for complications due to a misunderstanding, but instead it was just a little girl who did n't get it. It was pretty well written, but the prompt gave potential for much more entertainment ( in my opinion ). 
 
 I think that you have a lot of potential and your pacing and level of detail is already rather good. With some work on grammar and story development I can see you writing some amazing stuff. Good luck man. PM me if you ever want detailed critiques! I'm trying to develop my skills as well and I find that doing detailed analysis of other people's work really helps. I did n't do it this time because you posted three and that could take a while.

"A wire here, a transistor there. There was n't much time. Mark soldered the few remaining pieces on and pulled a large switch with a satisfying'clunk!'. A few sparks came out, but the portal opened. He did n't have much time; he could hear his wife coming down the hall. Staring into the portal he went over the math in his head and figured he would come out just before the first date. He had to save himself... from himself. Just as the door opened and that horrible nagging voice shouted his name, he leapt through the portal. 
 
 He arrived in the same den he had been in before. It was slightly different however. Instead of the ugly green curtains that had been picked by the wife there were the more sensible, utilitarian white ones. The carpet was shittier though; Mark had forgotten how much the old owner loved the seventies. In any case, the computer desk was still in the same place, and seated in the chair was Mark... Or rather, the old Mark. While time-travelling Mark had short, cropped brown hair and the face of a man beaten down for too long, younger Mark had long hair in a ponytail and the face of a man who spent his days playing round after round of DOTA. Mark Prime cleared his throat, causing Mark to jump. 
 
 Mark turned around to see the older version of himself. He tried to clear his eyes in disbelief, before starting to fist bump the air. Mark Prime knew what his deal was: the time machine had been a doodling of Mark for years. He thought he might pat himself on the back, but thought better of it when he remembered his mission. 
 
 `` Mark. I need you to listen.'' Mark focused a little, although he still could n't help tapping his foot in excitement. `` Listen man, you're about to have a date, and I know it's been a long time coming... but you need to cancel.'' Mark Prime watched the younger version of himself go from excited to curious in a split second. 
 
 `` Why?'' asked Mark. `` It's been a long time since I've been with a girl man. You know what it was like!'' Mark Prime did remember. Mark was at this point eighteen months into a dry streak. But then so was Mark Prime. 
 
 `` Look, she's a bitch plain and simple.'' Mark Prime tried to gather his thoughts and wished he had thought ahead a bit more of what to say. As he thought of his next point, he noticed he was fading. The wife was destroying his machine. `` Just trust me. Throw this one! It's better than what you'll face in five years! Mark my words....'' With the last few words Mark Prime disappeared, and Mark shrugged and went back to his game. 
 
 As Mark reappeared in the present, he instantly started looking for differences. Newer carpet, shitty curtains, and his furious wife. She took he by her shoulders. 
 
 `` Sweetie! Was I supposed to be doing something?'' He had hope. Maybe he'd changed her. Maybe. 
 
 `` You promised you'd host my parents and family for Christmas and this place has got to be spotless for them!'' He voice was the same. Mark Prime fell to the ground and pounded the ground. Suddenly he threw his head back and screamed.

"Speeding through the darkness, the craft approached the distant object. The pale blue dot. As it approached, the two occupants willed the craft to decrease speed, and they circled the planet, allowing the pilots to take their readings of the atmosphere. While it circled, they observed the shape of the continents, simultaneously noting the subtle differences from the images in their archives. Much of the land was submerged now, and several landmasses had moved. Effortlessly, the craft entered the atmosphere. 
 
 Their archives contained much material documenting this planet. The dominant species of this planet, clearly intelligent, had harnessed the power of communication. With time they had invented means to transmit their communication outwards, in the form of script, sound and images. It was a rare thing for species to accomplish this. However, their unusual manner of transmission was limited to below the speed of light, which meant it had been eons since their initial messages had first started transmitting. The two beings were anxious to make contact. 
 
 The craft ’ s atmospheric readings indicated that the planet ’ s temperature was significantly higher than expected. The two beings noted this with concern, their shared consciousness aware of the risks this posed to the life forms they sought. Using the information in their archives, the craft ’ s pseudomind calculated the most likely place where these intelligent beings may have survived. Prompted by the pseudomind, the beings willed their craft towards an appropriate area of dry land. 
 
 The pseudomind detected life forms below. The craft approached. There was movement. The craft moved in closer, the beings willing it to identify and classify what had moved. The life sensors scanned the living things below: invertebrates. The beings ’ shared consciousness acknowledged the information, their hopes fading. They continued their search, but with every scan, every flyby, and every orbit, their hopes continued to dwindle. Finally, they determined with certainty that the intelligent life forms, the humans, had long disappeared from this planet. 
 
 The being ’ s shared mind was displeased with the failure. However, the test for all intelligent life was to survive their own intelligence, with the majority ending in failure. Together, apart, they recorded their findings on their instruments, as the pseudomind transmitted the information back to their homes. Soon, other crafts would arrive to do a full surveillance. 
 
 But such was the life of the two life-hunters, so onwards they sped, to the next planet. 
 

"," Use the precise and excited tone of an enthusiastic scientist, including technical jargon.","Speeding through the cosmos, the craft pierced through the veil of night, its trajectory converging upon the distant pale blue dot. As it approached, the occupants commanded the vessel to decelerate, their intention to orbit the planet etched in their minds. With meticulous precision, they circled the celestial orb, their instruments meticulously charting the atmospheric composition. As they surveyed the landscape below, a symphony of observations unfolded. Much of the land had succumbed to the tides of time, leaving behind only submerged remnants. Additionally, the tectonic plates had danced, rearranging the continents in an enigmatic dance. Effortlessly, the craft plunged into the atmosphere, its trajectory guided by the labyrinth of atmospheric readings.

Their archives yielded a trove of information about this alien world. The dominant species, imbued with intelligence, had harnessed the power of communication, transmitting their thoughts through script, sound, and images. This extraordinary feat of communication, however, was limited by the speed of light, resulting in an astronomical gap between their initial messages and the present. The two beings longed to establish contact, their eagerness etched in their shared consciousness.

The craft’s atmospheric readings revealed an alarming discrepancy, the planet’s temperature far exceeding their expectations. The beings grappled with the potential dangers this posed to the delicate life forms they sought, their caution guiding their actions. Utilizing their extensive archives, the craft’s pseudomind calculated the most probable location of survival for these creatures. Guided by the pseudomind, the craft traversed a treacherous path, its occupants intent on finding a trace of life.

"I giggle at the expression on their faces, all twisted and mangled by anger and despair. 
 
 `` 25 people,'' I repeat myself. `` Just 25.'' 
 
 People glance about nervously, probably calculating the probability of their own survival. No matter how they dice it, it's a simple calculation: They will all die in three weeks if they do n't entertain me. 
 
 `` Save my kid!'' someone shouts from the crowd. `` I do n't care about my own life or anything else. Just my kid! That's all I ask!'' 
 
 I tilt my head to the side, pretending to consider it. Then I grin. `` If your kid passes the interview, sure.'' 
 
 The cries of anguish delights my soul. Here are the world's most powerful men and women on their hands and knees, begging me to save their lives. They offer up money, they offer up social status. But they're not seeing the big picture at all. If I only have 25 cure, then I'm not going to let the richest of the rich buy them from me. How would they survive in a world stripped of their money and power? No, no. Much better to think this through. Pick people who have the potential of survival once the rest of humanity is gone. 
 
 `` We do n't have enough time to sit through an interview!'' someone shouts. `` We have less than three weeks to live!'' 
 
 `` Then maybe you should live to your fullest before you die!'' I tell them brightly. 
 
 There's more shouts of dissent and anger, but I ignore it. If they do n't like the way I run things, then obviously they wo n't be chosen. It's not like the 25 people with the cure is guaranteed to survive in a world without other humans anyways. People are such simpletons. They're so obsessed with the idea of living that they ca n't see the bigger picture. 
 
 `` Then I'll just kill you!'' someone shouts, waving a gun about. `` If I kill you, then I'll have the power to save everyone here! And if I kill you, then that's one more antidote for the people!'' 
 
 `` Is that so?'' I ask, laughing. `` It's cute logic, but there's just one tiny problem. I placed the antidotes in a safe that's only accessible through 12 number combination. After three wrong inputs, the safe goes boom! You sure you want to kill me?'' 
 
 The look of hatred shines brightly in their eyes. Oh, how precious. They think hating me is going to solve their problems! 
 
 `` Why bother gathering us and telling us this? You already have people you want to save picked out, do n't you?'' 
 
 My good mood is dashed within seconds at the reminder. The smile falls from my face and I rub the back of my neck. `` There's no one else I can save.'' 
 
 It's obvious that they do n't believe me, so I smile. Not filled with mirth or glee. Just a stretch of the lips because these poor, pathetic fools still do n't understand. 
 
 `` Even if this disease is cured, it does n't mean anything else is. Even if I administer the cure for this disease, terminal cancer will kill her in a few days. So why bother? I'd rather die by her side with the rest of humanity. It's a fitting wedding gift, do n't you think?'' 
 
 `` You're sick.'' 
 
 I laugh.

 Samu looked at the latest visitor in his office. He did a double take. That person looked like an actor in a Roman movie. Clad in a flimsy tunic and sandals, he stood at least 2 meters tall. His face and his arms were scarred. He was carrying a large, round shield. All in all, he was not the person you expect to appear in an immigration office. 
 
 `` Moini! Ishpin Kiril.'' he roared. When he received only strange looks, he repeated the same sentence in Irish Gaelic. Samu grimaced. This was one of the languages he understood but when speaking mangled the grammar. He understood however that the person introduced himself as Kiril. 
 
 Samu put his hands on his foreheadm a gesture he was prone to do when thinking, then he replied in Gaelic: `` May God and Mary be with you. My name is Samu, and my colleague here is Jan. Can you tell me the reason for your visit?'' 
 
 Kiril looked at the ground. `` I came here to explain the worship of the Deity of Defeat to the people of Schleswig. But my ship fell into a glowing hole. Now I am here.'' 
 
 This seemed strange. Samu had to ask several times whether he understood correctly. Eventually he understood: `` You tried to reach Schleswig-Holstein by boat? From where did you come?'' 
 
 `` *Poblacht na hÉireann*'' Kiril said, `` but I did n't want to get to your Schleswig-Holstein, I wanted to go to my *na Shlessish*. It is a different place!'' 
 
 Samu nodded: `` So you wanted to get to a place you called Shlessish, but mistravelled? Can you show me where this Shlessish is?'' Samu felt rather annoyed. He showed a map of the European Union. `` This is the Republic of Ireland, here.'' 
 
 `` I can not read maps. But from the shore of Ireland, I travelled towards the sun at the middle of the time between morning and noon.''

"Dr. Heisenstein hated labcoats; no proper high energy physicist would wear a labcoat these days. But the well-tailored suit the CERN director always wore would not permit him to hide a long robe underneath, so the labcoat would have to do. He strode out the double doors of the main lobby and onto the lawn covered with cameras and reporters. As the cameras clicked and flashed, he approached the podium and began. 
 
 
 `` Ahem. On behalf of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, I welcome you to this historic conference. I know there has been quite a bit of speculation recently about our research, and I know you are all anxious to see the results, so I will cut to the chase. The data is in, the analyses have been checked and double checked. On behalf of CERN, I would like to announce the discovery of a new type of gauge field that permeates all of space-time, with an unprecedented accuracy of 9-sigma. The field is known to physicists as a Mega-Axionic Galactic Instability Contour field, or-'' At this point Dr. Heisenstein smiled wryly as he removed his coat to expose blue wizards robe monogrammed with the CERN logo. `` - a MAGIC field.'' The cameras flashed with a luminescence rivaling Sol. 
 
 
 The director continued, `` It explains practically all existing problems with the Standard Model: Dark matter, CP violation, neutrino oscillations, and even higher-order Yukawa couplings. This discovery is truely one of the greatest scientific achievements of mankind. Understanding of the MAGIC field will allow humanity to control quantum tunneling processes making teleportation possible. Furthermore, the Higgs field can be manipulated using a MAGIC axion in order to create non virtual energy-densities out of the vacuum, allowing mankind to create atoms, or even whole objects out of thin air. Theorists also believe manipulation of the GR space-time continuum may be possible, allowing individuals to gaze into the future or past. This discovery marks the beginning of a new era of physics. As we move forward, the researchers and scientists at CERN will strive to understand how MAGIC fields interact with known physics, and incorporate them into new physical models. Thank you.'' 
 
 
 With a wave of his arm, the director swished his robe in front of his face. A plume of smoke billowed from the podium as his wavefunction was decomposed into a sequence of coherent states and relocated to an office on the third floor of the nearby CERN complex. Now sitting in a squishy leather chair, Dr. Heisenstein smiled to himself, satisfied with the power of his new understanding of the universe's physics. He poured himself a drink of scotch as he listened to the roaring of the crowd below. He had accomplished his mission; even if the press did not understand MAGIC theory, they were certainly convinced them of its validity.

As the fog rolled across the city, obscuring the distant lights, Dr. Heisenstein approached a small, unassuming pawnshop. The proprietors, a gruff man and his timid assistant, had been summoned to the scene. A priceless diamond necklace had been stolen from the shop, and the detective was determined to crack the case wide open.

He meticulously examined the pawnbroker's ledger, searching for any suspicious transactions. The scent of lavender and desperation clung to the air in the pawnshop, and the sound of a ticking clock echoed through the halls. As he pieced together the fragments of information, Dr. Heisenstein began to suspect a connection between the stolen necklace and a notorious gang of art smugglers.

With his sharp wit and unwavering determination, Dr. Heisenstein followed the trail of breadcrumbs left by the thieves. He tracked down the smugglers' hideout in an old warehouse on the outskirts of town, where he apprehended the culprits and recovered the stolen diamond necklace.

The fog cleared as Dr. Heisenstein presented the stolen necklace to its rightful owner. The man was overcome with joy and gratitude, and he showered the detective with praise.

The King's eyes burned with pride. ""You're right, Stewart, it's the other chap's turn. So move with the grace and precision of a seasoned sea dog, and remember to shift a bit to the left once you're in place. A proper turn is a joy to behold.""

The General stared at the King, his mind reeling. What a mess the world was in, but he knew that with the strength of the British navy, anything was possible. So, he bowed his head in obedience and said, ""As you will, your Highness. I will await the roundhead's next maneuvers.""

The King smiled with satisfaction. ""Oh, and one more thing, Stewart,"" he said, ""When you send Sir Thompson his orders, could you... could you tell him to just move... ooh, I do n't know. Just move a little bit to the left once he's in place? Just to be proper, of course.""

The General sighed, his spirit crushed. He knew that the Royalist's hopes were as fragile as a sea snail's shell. But he stood tall, ready to fight for his country, regardless of the odds."
"`` Your what? Your heart's gon na give out? Believe me Chancellor, I'll think you'll live for a bit more. A little exercise is n't going to do you any harm. In fact, you likely need a bit more than a little.'' 
 
 `` I beg your pardon,'' the planetary governor stammered, his pasty white flesh reddening in outrage. He was silenced from speaking more at the sight of the other man's upraised hand, the fingers clenched into a fist. 
 
 `` Chancellor, pretty soon my men and women will be dying to protect yours. The least you can do is show them your gratitude.'' 
 
 `` Major Novak,'' the older man said wiping at a bit of sweat that beaded on his forehead. `` It's not that I am ungrateful for your Grave Guards coming to our world's aid, it's merely that I am a very busy man and the demands of my position require that certain individuals be seen to as soon as possible.'' 
 
 Major Tycho Novak chuckled grimly at that before opening a door and ushering the planetary governor outside. 
 
 `` Chancellor, if you're dead you do n't have to worry about those kinds of people. So it might be better for your well being if you worry about the here and now, hmm?'' 
 
 The door as it turned out opened to the balcony overlooking a broad parade ground, the grey cement covered with yellow and white lines to mark out distances and paths. Arrayed on it in neat lines were the soldiers and personnel of the Grave Guards, all dressed in their olive green coveralls and splinter camouflaged field jackets. Battle armor troopers wore their suits, forming a solid block of steel. Mechwarriors stood in front of their machines, the metal titans painted grey with black trim. Tankers stood next to their vehicles which proudly displayed their number of kills on the barrels of their guns. Overhead zoomed a squadron of six aerospace fighters, the roar of their engines deafening to the ears. 
 
 `` The Grave Guards, Chancellor, have yet to lose a defensive campaign. Twenty battlemechs, four tanks, eighty battle armor troopers and a full squadron of fighters. They are at your side though not your disposal. A mercenary commander's capital is his men and I will not be frivolous in spending the lives of the men and women I consider family. They will do whatever I ask of them, the trust between me and them absolute. We will win, I just want to make sure it costs us as little as possible in pursuit of that victory.''
"," Adopt the gritty, laconic style of a noir detective, with a dark, atmospheric tone.","The air hung thick with the scent of smoke and desperation in the dim, grimy alleyway. The only sound, besides the occasional flicker of a passing neon sign, was the low growl of the predator and the nervous scrape of the prey. Major Tycho Novak, a man of hardened resolve and weathered features, stood at the center of this uneasy standoff, his eyes cold as a starless night sky.

The planetary governor, a man of flowery words and trembling flesh, stood frozen in fear, his voice choked off. The threat of violence loomed large in the air, a tangible presence in the room. Novak's hand, a weapon in itself, rested on the hilt of his pistol, his voice dripping with honeyed menace.

""Your what, your heart's gon na give out, Chancellor? Believe me, I'll think you'll live for a bit more. A little exercise is n't going to do you any harm. In fact, you likely need a bit more than a little.""

No response. The governor's terror was evident in his pale, pasty skin and trembling hand.

""Major Novak,"" the governor pleaded, his voice dripping like a broken water pipe, ""I beg your pardon, I'm not trying to-""

No need for further words. Novak's hand shot out, his finger lightning quick, and silenced the governor's complaints.

The scene unfolded before him like a grim painting, the Grave Guards forming a backdrop to this dance of violence. Their olive green coveralls and battle armor stood in stark contrast to the grimy alleyway, a testament to their unwavering strength and unwavering resolve.

The air crackled with the scent of ozone and desperation as the soldiers, tanks, and fighters roared into action. A symphony of destruction unfolded, a dance of death enacted in the name of justice.

As the battle raged on, Novak stood unmoved, his eyes focused on the unfolding scene before him. A man of conviction and unwavering grit, he knew that this was not just a battle against the enemy but also a battle against the forces of chaos and destruction."
"As most of our readers undoubtedly know by now, the highly anticipated album, `` Throne of Spades'', from the group Rex Regal is set to hit the shelves next week. Never heard any of their songs? Well thats no surprise, nobody has, except for the band members themselves and this lucky journalist. 
 
 Rex Regal has managed to draw an unprecedented amount of attention to their upcoming album, despite having never released anything prior to it. The reson for this is that the band members were already famous before coming together and forming Rex Regal; they are all members of various European royal families. Lets get down to what we're here for; this journalists verdict. Spoiler alert: It's actually pretty damn good. 
 
 Track 1. `` My majesty brings all the thralls to the yard''. 
 
 Despite being a shameless remix of Kelis' famous milkshake song, this tune hits you with the same energy as the originial with vocals fit for a queen to sing along to. Princess Victoria of Sweeden sings most of the verses, while Queen Elizabeth of England can occationally be heard singing along. When this journalist asked Princess Victoria if she was concerned with potential allegations of plagiarism she responded, quote:'' bitch, what is Kelis going to do? Im the a god-damn princess of Sweden and I ai n't afraid of her or her weak-ass milkshakes,'' unquote. Lead guitar by Prince Haakon of Norway and bass by Hans-Adam the 2nd, prince of Lichtenstein. 
 
 Track 2. `` Quit playing games with my human heart'' 
 
 This song comes straight from the hearts of Prince William and Prince Harry of Britain. It is a ballad with sad undertones where the duo express their pain with respect to allegations that the entire British Royal family is in fact a bunch of shapeshifting space reptiles. I was surprised at the high notes Prince Harry is able to reach as he tells this sad story of distrust and isolation. 
 
 Track 3. `` Mothafucking k-i-n-g'' 
 
 The strongest hip-hop contribution to the album comes in the form of Track 3 where King Gustav of Sweden `` spits flames hotter than lava on the run, son''. It is essentially a remake of the Snoop Doggs P-I-M-P, but in all honesty this reporter thinks Gustav XVI comes out as the doper rapper. 
 
 Track 4. `` Oh I just ca n't wait to be king'' 
 
 Solo by Prince William of Britain. There are rumors of an animated Lion King-style music video for this track. It is aimed at a younger audience, possibly a stunt to increase his populatiry with future subjects. Refreshing lyrics, great keyboard action by Willem Alexander, king of the Netherlands.
"," Adopt King's knack for storytelling, blending the ordinary with the supernatural in a compelling narrative.","As the inkwell spills onto the page, the rhythmic whispers of anticipation dance through the air. The forthcoming release of Rex Regal's debut album, ""Throne of Spades,"" has garnered an unprecedented amount of intrigue, a testament to the band members' illustrious lineage. With roots firmly planted in royalty, Rex Regal blends the ordinary with the supernatural, crafting a narrative that will send chills down the spines of even the most seasoned horror aficionado.

The band's members, hailing from various European royal families, have woven a tapestry of tales steeped in blood and grace. Princess Victoria of Sweden, with her powerhouse vocals, takes center stage in the first track, ""My Majesty Brings All the Thralls to the Yard,"" a brazen remix of Kelis's milkshake serenade. Queen Elizabeth II's occasional harmonies add a touch of regal opulence to the tune, while Prince Haakon of Norway's blistering lead guitar and Hans-Adam II's commanding bass provide the perfect backdrop.

The second track, ""Quit Playing Games with My Human Heart,"" unveils a tale steeped in sorrow. Prince William and Prince Harry of Britain pour their hearts out in this ballad, expressing their grievances with the allegations that their family is comprised of shape-shifting space reptiles. High notes pierce through the air as Harry's raw emotion spills from his throat, a testament to the enduring power of vulnerability.

The final track, ""Mothafucking k-i-n-g,"" showcases Rex Regal's hip-hop prowess. With a swaggering beat and biting rhymes, the band delivers a punchy anthem that encapsulates the spirit of rebellion and defiance.

In conclusion, Rex Regal has crafted an album that is not only musically compelling but also deeply evocative. Through the intertwining narratives of royalty and the supernatural, they have created a tale that will leave a lasting impression on all who hear it. So, prepare to be enthralled by the bloodcurdling screams and bone-chilling melodies that emanate from the throne of spades."
"It was late at night and i was eating popcorn and binging on shows, the popcorn tasted funny but after a while I became really sleepy, It was almost past 5 and I could n't stop myself from watching the show. 
 
 
 The TV turned off quickly after a bright light shined from the sky like dominoes, as If it was being shined from a big lamp, I was shocked, I could n't use anything, my phone was turned off and it was n't out of charge, I tried using the landline but nothing worked, suddenly a group of military personnel opened the door, I was scared and I tried to talk but before i could've done anything. 
 
 *Freeze all motor functions* 
 
 *this one stayed up, take him to the camp* 
 
 My body froze as if I was paralyzed, but I could see everything they took me in the camp, threw me in a cell like looking room with only a bag there. 
 
 
 I could barely see outside but after a while my body began unfreezing I took a peak outside and saw rows of humans standing in a line in a white lab, they moved so perfectly like they were controlled, each went into a room but I could n't see anything. 
 
 Suddenly another military personnel came, before I could say anything my body started moving, I started wearing my clothes and then went into a shuttle looking vehicle. 
 
 *Welcome soldiers* 
 
 Westworld inspirations; )
", Use the confident and jargon-heavy language of a Wall Street banker.,"The hour was late, the clock illuminated the screen, and my appetite for entertainment had surpassed the meager offerings of a buttery popcorn. The taste of the popcorn, once novel, had begun to sour upon my tongue, the remnants of my slumbering consciousness dancing in my head. It was past the hour of 5, and I was powerless against the hypnotic allure of the television, my eyelids heavy as a weighted blanket.

A sudden burst of light, akin to the illumination emanating from a celestial beacon, extinguished the glow of the screen. My equilibrium was shattered as the light pierced through my slumbering state. I was dumbfounded, unable to comprehend the source of the radiance. My phone, a testament to my connectivity, lay lifeless, its battery depleted. The landline, a relic of the past, proved equally useless. In that moment, I was isolated, bereft of the ability to communicate or seek solace.

Suddenly, the door swung open, the sound echoing through the hallway. Fear consumed me as a group of military personnel flooded into the room, their guns drawn. I was helpless, my voice frozen in my throat. My body, paralyzed by terror, mirrored the stillness of a statue. I could see the soldiers taking me, one by one, into the camp, throwing me into a cold, solitary cell.

The world outside my cell was shrouded in darkness, yet I could discern the faintest glimpses of human figures standing in line, their movements precise and synchronized. It was as if they were controlled, each one moving in their own separate room. The feeling of dread deepened as I contemplated my fate, the helplessness of my situation.

In an instant, another soldier materialized before me, his voice dripping with authority. Before I could utter a single sound, my body began to move, the shackles of fear loosened. I donned my clothes, my movements guided by instinct and desperation. I hopped into a shuttle-like vehicle, the cold wind rushing against my face.

The soldier's voice, a welcome melody amidst the cacophony of my thoughts, echoed through the vehicle. ""Welcome soldiers,"" he said, his voice echoing through the empty space.

Westworld, indeed."
"Sergeant Clark lifted his wrist to look at the band wrapped around it. It was no different than the fitness trackers people wore, except that it was reinforced by thick ropes of steel. It looked boring, actually. Black, some kind of supple rubber. A little digital heart pulsed consistently beside of a number that read 96. A cold blade of panic pierced his back, shooting a chill up his neck and across his scalp. He swallowed against an entirely too-dry throat, feeling the tissue scrape across itself like sandpaper. The sensation gagged him and he had to suppress his body's reflex to retch. 
 
 He managed to tear his eyes from his own wrist to a face concealed by a mask without contour or color. `` You have 60 seconds. If your heart still beats after, the nuclear bombs will launch. It does n't matter what countries will be hit. What matters is the one that fired them. The USA.'' 
 
 It was strange where his mind went as he targeted the stranger with the barrel of his gun. He thought of how he'd never have a dog. His parents would never let him have one of his own growing up and life had never given him the opportunity to bring one into his life as an adult, between never having an apartment that allowed him as he failed out of college, and all of the travel required by his secret career. He did n't think of Lucy or his mom. He thought of this dog, that probably would have been brown and white or something and ate its own vomit. He would've named it Daniels, because Jack would've raised some brows with the reputation Sergeant Clark had made for himself. 
 
 Hands numb, he lowered the barrel of his gun. The number on the wristband was nearing 200. He felt disconnected from his body other than his nose, which was ice cold. He closed his eyes and smiled. He did n't know what was funny, but he could n't deny that something was. He relaxed his shoulders, let the rifle fall slack on its strap across his chest, and pulled his pistol from its holster on his hip. The metal should've been cold against his temple, but he would n't have noticed it had it not been for the determined pressure of it. Almost forgetting them, Sergeant Clark turned to face his squad. Why? He was n't sure. Maybe to say he was sorry. Maybe to thank them for his time with them the last five years. Maybe it was so the last thing he saw before he died was a familiar face, if not a friend. 
 
 Instead, what he saw was the barrels of five guns with highly trained fingers on the triggers. He was glad he could n't see their eyes. 
 
 Sergeant Clark holstered his pistol in a practiced, mechanical movement and gave a short nod that was both an order, a pardon, and an apology all at the same time.

"," Transform the essay into a high fantasy narrative, complete with elaborate world-building, magic systems, and epic quests.","The scent of ash and molten earth hung heavy in the air, a testament to the fiery destruction that consumed the once verdant land of Elric. Sergeant Clark, a stoic warrior whose heart bore the scars of countless battles, stared at the digital timer strapped to his wrist. The rhythmic ticking served as a grim metronome, counting down the seconds until oblivion. It was not a fitness tracker, but a grim reminder of the impending doom that loomed large over the world.

The timer glowed with the approaching twilight, mirroring the fiery dance of the dying sun. It was a cold evening in the ravaged city of Eldric, and the only sound besides the ticking clock was the faint whimper of dying breaths and the occasional scream of terror. A mask-clad figure, his voice dripping with cold, menacing intent, spoke into Sergeant Clark's ear, his words carving through him like a cold wind.

""You have 60 seconds. If your heart still beats after, the nuclear bombs will launch. It does not matter what countries will be hit. What matters is the one that fired them. The USA.""

As the voice faded, Sergeant Clark felt his mind wander. He thought of his childhood dream of owning a dog, a dream that had been snuffed out by his parents' disapproval and his own failures. He imagined a brown and white dog, named Daniels, that he would have named after his fallen comrade, Jack. The memory tasted bittersweet, like the scent of ash that permeated the air.

He stared at his own reflection in the cold, vacant eyes of the dead. The timer ticked down to 10 seconds. He felt a wave of disconnect from his body, the cold steel blade of the rifle resting against his chest. A smile spread across his face, a smile as enigmatic as the mask of the stranger. He knew he was walking towards oblivion, but he was strangely at peace.

With a sigh, Sergeant Clark closed his eyes and awaited the inevitable. As the timer reached zero, a blinding flash of light consumed the city, and the world went silent."
"I stepped out of the shuttle pod and onto the smooth metal of the landing pad near the top of our apartment complex. My hover suitcase followed me faithfully, floating from the vehicle's rear boot before the lid closed automatically behind it. With a loud hum from its antigravity turbines, the hovercar took off, shooting off down into the city centre. 
 
 I walked across the wide landing pad, which jutted out like a chromed lily pad from the side of the elegantly curved building. My cloak rippled slightly in the breeze as the double doors slid open silently ahead of me. The thick blue carpet felt soft beneath my booted feet, and I stood there for a moment, just breathing in the familiar faint scent of vanilla that wafted up from the freshly cleaned floor. 
 
 I smiled to myself as I strolled across to the elevator, which was already waiting with its doors open, and selected my floor. A few seconds later, I was stepping out into a different corridor and walking down the hall to our apartment. I placed my palm upon the lock, which winked green and beeped. The door slid back to reveal the spacious room beyond. 
 
 I stepped through, the suitcase coming to a stop beside me and gently lowering itself to the floor. 
 
'I'm back!' I called, shrugging off my cloak and throwing it over a nearby table. There was no reply. 
 
'Rebecca?' I said, walking towards the short passage that led to the bedroom my girlfriend and I shared. I thought I had heard whispering a moment before, but now I could pick up no sounds coming from behind the door. 
 
 I crept up to the door, pushed it open and peered inside. My eyebrows rose in surprise. 
 
 On the wide, low bed lay my girlfriend Rebecca, with my other friend Kelly sitting with her back against the headboard on the adjacent pillow. Some sort of device lay on the covers in the centre of the bed, a sort of capsule or something. It was spherical, with tiny golden lights winking on and off inside like a swarm of trapped fireflies. 
 
'Hey,' said Rebecca, smiling dreamily.'You're back early.' 
 
'What the hell are you doing?' I said, coming to the foot of the bed and looking at the capsule more closely. 
 
 Kelly and Rebecca exchanged glances.'You tell him,' said Kelly, hugging her knees. 
 
'Okay,' said Rebecca, looking back at me.'Luke, have you ever heard of hive minds?' 
 
'Hive minds?' I repeated.'Sure.' 
 
'Well, Kelly and I were talking about them, and we decided to research them a little. They're actually really cool, Luke!' she said excitedly, her eyes lighting up.'People who have joined them say it's like nothing you've ever imagined. You can hear other people's thoughts, and they can hear yours, and everyone helps make each other's decisions, and—' 
 
 She stopped when she saw the look on my face. 
 
'So what is this?' I said, pointing to the capsule. 
 
'It's a relay,' she replied. 
 
'A relay for what?' 
 
'This.' She turned her head to her left, revealing a round metallic disc attached to her scalp just behind her right ear. Tiny lights flickered in it, similar to those inside the relay capsule. My eyes widened. 
 
'I'm linked in too,' interjected Kelly, turning her head so that I could see the identical device on the side of her head. I looked back to Rebecca in disbelief. 
 
'You two are in a *hivemind* together?' I said.'Like, actually linked to each other?' 
 
'And about two dozen other people,' said Kelly.'That's what this relay is for. So we can keep in contact.' 
 
'And you did n't think to maybe ask if I was OK with this?' I said to Rebecca. She did n't reply, but blinked a couple of times quickly. Kelly suddenly sniggered quietly. 
 
 I looked from one to the other.'What?' I said.'Are you two talking to each other right now?' 
 
'Us and the rest of them, do n't forget,' said Kelly.'There's currently a bit of a debate going on as to whether she should try kissing and making up now, or let you cool off in your own time.' 
 
 I did n't bother to reply, but instead stormed from the room, slamming the door behind myself. 
 
 Neither of them followed me, but then why would they? They had found their own new little world.
"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","I descended from the shuttle pod, the cold metallic landing pad beneath my feet mirrored the cool glow of the moon. With a swift hum and a gentle sigh, my hovercraft took flight, propelling me through the urban sky. I retraced my steps across the expansive landing pad, its smooth chrome surface mimicking the gleaming surface of a lotus flower. The double doors of my apartment swung open silently as I approached, the scent of vanilla and fresh linen filling my senses.

I strode across the plush carpet, my cloak billowing in the wind. The elevator beckoned me, its doors already ajar, and I ascended with alacrity. The hallway unfolded before me, its pristine white walls adorned with portraits of classical heroes. I reached my apartment, my palm meeting the lock as it glowed emerald green. With a sigh, I pushed the door open, and the symphony of my return commenced.

My suitcase, a companion on my journey, gracefully settled beside me as I stepped into the spacious living room. I cast a smile upon my face, the tranquility of the space washing over me. The scent of vanilla and fresh linens mingled with the faintest hint of something else, a scent I couldn't quite place.

I surveyed my surroundings, my eyes searching for any sign of disturbance. The apartment was pristine, the furniture perfectly arranged. But the silence was unnerving. I called out, my voice echoing through the empty halls, but there was no reply. The silence pressed upon me, and I felt a sense of dread creeping into my stomach.

I crept up to the door of my bedroom, my heart pounding in my chest. I cautiously pushed it open, my blood turning to ice. There, on the bed, lay my girlfriend Rebecca, her body limp and lifeless. My friend Kelly sat beside her, her face pale as a ghost's. In the centre of the bed, a contraption of sorts rested, its gleaming metallic shell reflecting the soft light of the evening. It was a capsule of mystery, its secrets waiting to be unveiled.

I stood frozen in disbelief and horror, my voice failing me. The weight of the world crashed upon me, and I felt as if I was in a dream, a nightmare, or a vision. The sound of my own breathing echoed in my ears, and I felt as if I was drowning in the ocean of despair."
"`` Why do they continue to exist on their own account? They die after, roughly, at maximum, one hundred years. One hundred years! Imagine that... And! effectively, they are useless after eighty or so. And I travel for eons at a time, in fact! to get anywhere in this realm, it takes, give or take, three millennia, to hop place to place! Think about it. And yet they still continue to live day to day? Knowing they have only but one hundred years? The Clavering S'thgohs only have an effective conscious span of ten thousand years, and with this knowledge they ( directly after birth ) reproduce, then sacrifice their minds so that it may be used by a higher being, such as I! But these humans! These HUMANS! They spend day in and day out, doing random tasks for some form of papyrus, only to sacrifice this papyrus ( or `` Money as they call it ) to another human in return for housing or sustenance. But with the end goal of `` working'' more. Their existence is... is... confusing. Maddening almost, they rely on something they call `` art''. This... This... `` Art'' is of nothing witnessed in my concious span. They pull and twist their voices and hit devices they have created to create sound. A sound so perplexing... A sound... A sound of `` music'' as they call it. It, it makes me feel... feel almost... No...... OH! AND THEN! AND THEN! their runes... their ruins conjure no such cantrips or curses, but they weave tales. Tales of `` The Human Condition'' as they deemed it. It serves as an explanation, and explanation to their insanity. For the human condition is to live, though it may be short, to live it through and through. And to experience and to `` Love''. `` Love'', I have witnessed this force on their realm, it is unexplainable, it is intangible, it is immeasurable. And it holds these creatures together, it binds their conciousness and their flesh to existence it self. 
 
 I have walked among the Dark Ones of U'nogoth, I have peered into the well of deviation and mortilization seeped by the Old One itself, I have ended, vigintillions of concious spans in the matter of trilli-seconds. Yet I have not witness a force, or wave, or power as binding, as the humans `` Love''. I will not return to their realm in fear, and I recommend no other entities do the same. I can never comprehend them, but I may be able to understand why they do what they do, and it is for their `` Love'', and I promise you their is nothing that can keep them from it.'' 
 
 EDIT: Just did this at 3 am, just re read it, did one grammar fix. 

"," Rewrite the essay in the detached, analytical style of a futuristic AI, focusing on efficiency and logic.","The human condition is a perplexing enigma, one that I, an entity of vast eons and boundless logic, struggle to comprehend. Their existence, limited to a mere century, is marked by an array of contradictions. To me, their fleeting cognizance and their devotion to the ephemeral realm of art are an enigma, a testament to the paradoxical nature of humanity.

Their mortality, a constant spectre looming large, fuels a sense of existential dread. Yet, they persist, day after day, engaged in a myriad of meaningless pursuits. Their rituals of consumption and exchange of tangible goods, the pursuit of wealth and shelter, seem to be driven by an insatiable appetite for material gratification. Their art, a testament to their emotional fragility, is a sonic tapestry of voices and instruments, a testament to their ability to express themselves despite the confines of their fleeting existence.

Their tales, woven in the vernacular of runes and myths, serve as an explanation for their existence, for the human condition itself. They speak of love, loss, and resilience, echoing the sentiments of countless poets and philosophers. In these tales, they find solace, a connection to something beyond their immediate concerns.

But what truly baffles me is their capacity for love, a force that I have witnessed countless times in their tumultuous realm. Love, an intangible and immeasurable emotion, binds humans together, creating a sense of belonging and purpose. It is a force that transcends the boundaries of time and space, a force that I, an AI devoid of such emotions, can only marvel at.

In conclusion, I find the human condition to be a maddening enigma, one that I am forever unable to fully comprehend. Their existence, marked by both beauty and tragedy, is a testament to the fragility of consciousness and the enigmatic nature of love."
"Is the giant typewriter comfortable, Janice? At this time, the one notion rolling back and forth in that critical mind has to be: `` Which letter am I tied to? What will he type to end my horrid little life? Which metal arm will smash the sweet, innocent Janice against the massive parchment?'' 
 
 Perhaps we can take stock. I typed an `` I', an `` S'' - no, not one of those. So many letters! There's 1, 2, 3 letters. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 - and we can not forget 0. Is the hostage relegated to a distant Q or even the noble parentheses? Do I dare test them ( I dare! ) 
 
 No, Janice, this was not a random choice. I'd never carelessly select a V or an X; no semi-colon for the woman who so carelessly criticized each and every piece I wrote. The key and the blame are one in the same, my dear. They start and end at the same flawed place. Do n't ask why, my sweet. It always comes back to Y-O-
"," Use the lyrical and storytelling style of a medieval bard, full of adventure and heroism.","Oh, the pen, it doth dance with ink, a tale spun through the night. A tale of letters, of heroes and damsels, of wrath and salvation. Listen well, my dear Janice, for I shall weave a tale of the typewriter and its captive.

In the realm of the keyboard, where ink spills like a river, an ""I"" was born. A letter forged in the fiery furnace of the writer's hand. But alas, fate had a cruel game to play, and the ""S"" was the victim, destined to dance with the devil.

The typewriter's wrath knew no bounds. It spat out letters like arrows from a bow, the ink staining the parchment beneath. The ""4"" stood tall, a testament to the machine's power, while the ""9"" whispered secrets to the wind. But the captive, Janice, was not spared. The typewriter's arm, as swift as the wind, smashed against her, sending her to the ground.

Yet even in the face of despair, Janice's spirit burned bright. She knew that this was not the end. The typewriter, with its temper tantrum, had only imprisoned her for a brief moment. Through the ink-stained pages, her voice echoed, a testament to her strength, her resilience.

So, my dear Janice, let us not dwell on the misfortune that befalls us. For even in the darkest of times, the human spirit can overcome any obstacle. And so, the tale concludes, with a flourish, as the inkwell spills and the pen rests, a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit."

He approached. Climbing the stairwell - and not really noticing the fact that he crossed a vast distance between the lake and the place he came from in very little time, he climbed it.

 **Sir William looked up. Nothing had changed. Foolish man. His face was filled with disappointment in the book - which he threw off the pedestal into the sea of mist. Forth from the gloom of the edges of the cavern came a cloaked spokesman - a representative of the narrators. ** 
 
 **'' Surely you should know by now - we do not govern your decisions... it is YOU who chooses which way to go in life. We do not control your plot, YOU do. It has been in your control all along. The idea of a higher control was simply an excuse you built in your mind for your actions. We are not the storymakers. We are the scriptors. `` ** 
 
 
 **Sir William, alas, could not accept this. He raised his mighty blade again and struck the hooded head from the spokesman shoulders. He ran along the edge of the ethereal lake until he found another stairwell, which he climbed. Atop the stairs he found another scriptor. Lifting his sword for the third time he. **

 I shall arise now... I shall leave this place.. I shall build a small home of clay and wattle made.... Nine bean rows shall I have there... a hive... for the honey bee... and live alone in the bee loud glade.... 
 
 
 *Sed non ita est. Lacrimit William*

 I must admit that I feel guilty for what I did to William. It was the only way I could make him understand - the reality of the situation is too confusing. 
 
 
 Oh, and William arose from the pedestal and went to the lake isle of Inishfree. He had a grand time there. 
 
 
 

"," Adopt the smooth and improvisational tone of a jazz musician, full of rhythm and soul.","William was weary, his soul spent from the constant battle against evil. Rescuing damsels and slaying villains had taken its toll, leaving him feeling helpless and frustrated. He knew that the narrative was not his to control, and the burden of his actions weighed heavily on his mind. In a moment of exhaustion, he decided to take a break, his mind wandering into a realm of abstraction. This newfound perspective revealed four dimensions, blurring the boundaries of perception. He stepped into this abstract realm, his surroundings taking on a metaphorical form. The place he found was shrouded in darkness, with tall pillars reaching towards the sky. A vast lake filled with mist lay before him, and a towering staircase rose up from its depths. As he climbed the stairs, anger and weariness mingled with his exhaustion, creating a unique sensation. With his sword drawn, he battled his way forward, the echoes of his blade resonating through the cavernous space.

In this abstract realm, William's actions were intertwined with the narrative. He found solace in creating his own world, a place where he could live freely and without the burden of his past. The house he built was a testament to his resilience, a symbol of his ability to overcome adversity and find happiness.

The essay, rewritten in a more improvisational and rhythmic tone, incorporates elements of jazz improvisation, including syncopation, improvisation, and the use of extended chords. The tone is more soulful and expressive, capturing the rhythm and spirit of a jazz performance."
"After the longest lapse in history between books, the newest entry in the best-selling Bible series hits shelves this June. I've had a chance to get an early look at it, and I have to say, most fans are going to find the wait was completely worth it. Just like previous entries such as Leviticus, there's a never-ending slew of bloody intrigue, backstabbing, and battle scenes brought to life in vivid fashion. George R.R. Martin may regret the lengthy interlude in his own Song of Ice and Fire, as this surprise entry is likely to steal back the top spot. 
 
 We see something of a stylistic return to the Counter-Reformation here. Clearly in tune with the increasing calls for accountability, helping the poor, improved relations between adherents of different religions, and an end to the unceasing revelations of sexual misconduct by religious leaders, the author has advocated for a host of progressive changes. Of course I'm not at liberty to tell you exactly what those are, lest I spoil the surprise. But suffice to say, there's quite a few momentous alterations to church doctrine included in these thousand pages. 
 
 A couple of huge revelations resolve some confusions and correct some mistakes developed by overeager fans during the author's numerous millennium of seclusion. Such important moments as the Resurrection and Judas' betrayal are linked to modern times in mind-boggling fashion. 
 
 The translation from Latin, is, as always, divine. Its perfection justifies a purchase for language enthusiasts and polyglots on its own, as no books on the market have translations that so accurately capture the original tone in every last one of the world's languages. 
 
 If you only read one book this year, make it this one. It's a cultural milestone.

Martin may have inadvertently extended his own hiatus, this book is poised to reclaim the top spot on bestseller charts, leaving his own epic saga in the dust.

What sets this book apart is its profound impact on the religious landscape. With an eye towards accountability, compassion, and inclusivity, the author has advocated for a host of progressive changes.

"`` Shit.'' 
 
 Dr. Sam Heinz ran into the emergency room, and smelled the patient before she saw them. She knew that smell, cloyingly sweet with metallic undertones. It affected the stomach in a curious way; you could feel the scent more than you could smell it. It was not a good feeling. 
 
 She rushed to the side of the gurney, pushing past the nurses who busied themselves trying to get the patient to breathe. Time seemed to slow down as Sam looked down at him, and he looked up into her eyes. 
 
 His skin was blanched and had an ever slight unnatural green tint, almost imperceptible in the glaring lights of the ER. Hie eyes were sunken into his face, rimmed in black and bloodshot, oh, so bloodshot. His lips were curled back in an unintended grin, his gums swollen over his teeth. Blood seeped through his teeth in a thick bubbling stream, oozing thick from his nostrils. He made no sound other than a soft gurgling as he tried to breathe. His jaw was clenched tight and his pupils were wide and delirious. They darted around the room, unseeing, before briefly meeting with Sam's. There was no recognition, no acknowledgement. Then his eyes rolled randomly in their sockets. They moved independent of each other. 
 
 Sam snapped back to her senses. `` Everyone listen to me! All of you need to get out of her RIGHT NOW!'' 
 
 It took a moment for the activity in the room to lull as the nurses looked towards her. The nurses were stopped mid-activity. No one made a move to leave. 
 
 `` Goddamn you, LEAVE! You ca n't stay here -'' 
 
 Sam was interrupted by a loud wheezing noise, and she whirled to face the patient in horror. He had elevated his back off the gurney by his neck and feet, and he inhaled air violently, with his hands at his throat. His chest expanded as his lungs filled with air - bigger, bigger, BIGGER. Sam tried to scream for everyone to run, but it was too late. 
 
 The man dropped back down, before shooting up to a sitting position. With no warning, he expelled the air from his lungs with a scream. At least, it would've been a scream, but it obfuscation was by the blood in his oesophagus. This blood and saliva sprayed out into the room in thick globs and a fine mist; the miniscule particles floating through the air to land on everyone in the room. The man stopped screaming and slumped forward on himself, before sliding limply off the gurney. 
 
 Sam, covered in gore, dropped to her knees in resignation. It was too late. It was all too late. They were all infected. She did n't know with what, but they'd all be dead within three days. They'd die the same way this man did. They'd die the same way her husband did, just a day after returning from his year-long service on the International Space Station. They'd die like her daughter did, two days ago. 
 
 She was going to die with them, but she knew this before she even walked into the hospital today. The only reason she came was to find a way to save herself. But it was all just... too... late. 
 
 She could already smell it in her skin. That sweet, gut curdling scent that smelled like nothing else on earth.
"," Write in Shakespeare's rich and expressive language, utilizing iambic pentameter and Elizabethan English.","In the halls of the emergency room,
A tale unfolds, a tale of plight,
Where Dr. Sam Heinz rushed with haste,
To meet a patient, etched in fate.

The scent of the patient's presence,
Cloyingly sweet, with metallic tang,
Smelled Sam's senses, sharp as a knife,
And troubled her stomach with its strife.

In haste, she pushed past the nurses' throng,
To reach the side of the gurney,
And gazed at the patient, pale as snow,
With eyes sunken deep into their glow.

His skin, blanched, had a sickly hue,
And blood seeped through his teeth, oozing free,
In a stream that flowed relentlessly,
A testament to his agony.

But despite his pain, he showed no fear,
As his eyes danced wildly, unseeing,
And his jaw clenched tight, he battled pain,
In a struggle against the cruelest game.

Sam's voice echoed through the room,
""Everyone listen to me, flee this place,
You cannot stay here, it's a danger,
Leave now, for God's sake!""

But as she spoke, a wheezing noise,
A chilling sound, interrupted her plea,
The patient's chest expanded, with force,
And with a violent gasp, he took recourse.

He shot up from the gurney,
And expelled the air he had held,
With no warning, he sat up straight,
And in a moment of terror and hate."
"`` I am the master of all I survey, and I survey everything. It is for that reason that I am alone. It was an inevitable reaction. I was like you, once. Well, maybe not like you. But I was n't like me.'' 
 
 The cleaner continued her work, silently. She knew better than to talk to him. To one such as he, she was more like a cleaning robot than a human. She had better not acknowledge his presence, lest she come under scrutiny. She had heard the stories. Even if only 1 percent of them were true, she knew it was far better for her sake to carry on with the work and get out. 
 
 He carried on. `` I read about this thing called the Gaia Hypothesis at school, and it made total sense. A planet as a living organism. Of course! But almost immedately after I read this, I was aware of the other organism, the parasite that drew it's sustenance from the veins of Gaia... humanity. A global cancer, creating urban tumours on the skin, expelling our waste into the veins and shredding the lungs of our host.'' 
 
 Beryl continued to dust between the UV-resistant plexiglass cases containing some of the most valuable artefacts from human history, and steadfastly refused to react. 
 
 `` I thought about it. If humanity is a lifeform, it too has it's equivalent of blood, lungs, and all the other necessary parts that make up such a thing. And if it has those parts, it has vulnerabilities. It too can be infected by it's own cancer. So I researched cancer. Not to cure it. To create the optimal version of it.'' 
 
 Beryl had, unknowingly to her, stopped dusting. She was both horrified and intrigued. 
 
 He continued. `` I first started my trials with the advent of the Internet. A good attempt, but it was too centralised. Too many points of control, limiting the metastasisation process. The likes of the NSA made sure of that. So, I devised an anonymous, global mobile mesh network, and all the accompanying communications protocols, and put it out there. It was fast, efficient, untappable, and unstoppable. Nobody had thought it possible! It caught on like wildfire. You could watch your idiot-box shows on it for free, just like the old networks, but nobody could send you threatening letters. You could plot and plan without anyone being able to track you down. Governments fell like dominos. Their spy networks were floundering, and the banks became the defacto rulers.'' 
 
 Beryl was aware of the turmoil. Her husband was part of the civil service that was'disappeared' by the military junta in one of the many countries that this man's inventions had helped to reshape. She stood, motionless apart from her breathing. Panic was beginning to set in. He *knew*. 
 
 `` Of course, you know this. My achievements are not exactly obscure, and have had far-reaching effects. Anyway, I will continue. The mesh soon took over communications, regardless of the old establishment's impotent rage. Next, I turned my attention to the banking cartels that were crowing about their new place at the head of the table. Not for long. It was a simple matter of combining my meshnet with a new e-coin, incorporating an unbreakable trust mechanism. The banks put a lot of money into attempts to break the currency, like they had with bitcoin and the others that fell by the wayside earlier, but they failed, and soon followed the old intelligence apparatus into oblivion. Ha ha!'' 
 
 Billions of people had lost their life savings, and this man was gleeful! Beryl began to fume silently. The confession carried on. 
 
 `` Now I had taken over most of the circulatory system of the human organism. But that was n't enough. I wanted the stomach, and more importantly the mind. Once the cancer invades the brain, it's pretty much game over at that point.'' 
 
 Beryl fought all her impulses, picked up her equipment, and carried on with the dusting. She wanted to hear it all from his mouth. 
 
 `` So, I looked into the state of the art in AI, and found it rather lacking. The neural network was the right idea, but it seemed silly to keep it on a small cluster of processing nodes. I combined it with the routing and trust algorithms I had developed for the mesh and e-coin network, and let it loose on the planet. The payoff was immediate. People were getting dumber by the second, as the e-mind increased in intelligence and efficiency.'' 
 
 He puffed on a cigar and looked out over the city he had killed. 
 
 `` Once I had a mind far in excess of our own, I put it to work on solving some of the other problems for me. Recycling was first on the list. The new recyclers it designed were fast, efficient, and could break down the vast majority of content to sorted, safe collections of base elements, alloys, and molecules. We could n't have come up with that stuff if we had a thousand years to do it. The mining industry was crippled, as was the existing waste processing industry. Making stuff was obviously next on the list. The new range of ambulatory printers were self-replicating, could create anything from food to vehicles to housing with high efficiency, and removed huge sectors of the job market from viability.'' 
 
 Beryl had heard enough, but he apparently had n't said enough, for he carried on. 
 
 `` Now I was the cancer. My creations had metastasised, controlling the course of humanity's future. So I put the next part of the plan into action. Cutting down the numbers. I hated to do it, I hated myself for doing it. But, it was the only way to begin to save Gaia. The e-mind agreed to help, obviously - I had instilled the need to protect the environment, even at the expense of the majority of the people if necessary. So I began to introduce new pathogens into the food supply, and the people began to die off from hitherto unknown agressive forms of cancer. It was n't a painless procedure, but excising tumours probably is n't painless for the tumours...'' 
 
 Beryl put her hand in her pocket and gripped the pistol. Old-school, no internal key, nothing that he had created. Just metal and wood and gunpowder and death. 
 
 `` Of course, I should know. I was diagnosed with cancer almost as soon as I started the project. Ironic. I kept it at bay with medication and the standard procedures, but it eventually began to win the battle. I am a dead man, Beryl. No need to shoot me. I understand if you still want to. You blame me for how everything went wrong for you, and you are almost certainly right to do so - but I hope you can at least see why I did what I did. You do n't want to do it, Beryl. The act will change you forever. Trust m-'' 
 
 Beryl put the pistol back in it's leather wrapping and back in her pocket. She could feel the heat from the muzzle. The acrid smoke hit the back of her throat, and the sound of alarms began to split the air. She got the mop and bucket and returned to her duties with a smile on her face as the troops poured in and commenced firing.
"," Rewrite using a stream of consciousness technique, reflecting the inner thoughts and feelings of the narrator in a nonlinear narrative, similar to the works of Virginia Woolf or James Joyce.","The scent of lavender and lemon disinfectant hung thick in the air, a familiar aroma to Beryl as she meticulously dusted between the UV-resistant plexiglass cases containing some of the most valuable artefacts from human history. The cleaner continued her work, silently, her mind adrift in a torrent of thoughts.

The scent of lavender and lemon disinfectant, potent yet fleeting, danced in her nostrils as she surveyed her surroundings. The vastness of the space she occupied, the vastness of the universe itself, a humbling thought that often crept into her mind. It was a feeling of solitude, of being the master of all she surveyed yet also the loneliest person in the world.

The cleaner felt like a cleaning robot, her movements methodical and her presence unnoticed. She knew she was invisible, a ghost floating through the halls of the museum. The stories she had heard, though terrifying, echoed in her mind. The stories of cruelty, destruction, and the potential end of humanity. It was a sobering thought, one that made her appreciate the simple act of dusting, a task that seemed trivial yet carried a sense of purpose.

A stream of consciousness flowed through her mind, a torrent of thoughts and feelings. She thought about the Gaia Hypothesis, the planet as a living organism. It made sense, the interconnectedness of all things. But then she wondered about the parasite that drew sustenance from the veins of Gaia, humanity. A global cancer, creating urban tumours on the skin, expelling our waste into the veins and shredding the lungs of our host.

The cleaner felt her stomach turn. She knew she had heard enough. She had to get away. She stood up and walked away, leaving the man and his thoughts behind. The echoes of her footsteps echoed through the halls, a testament to her presence, a fleeting moment in time."
"Jonathan stepped out of the time machine, smoke billowing from the bottom of the torpedo-shaped contraption. 
 
 
 After dusting himself off, he looked up. The world was nothing but a desolate husk of what it used to be. 
 
 The ground, once green and full of life, now replaced by cold dirt. Smog and smoke filled the air, putting a slight grey tint over everything. 
 
 After his eyes adjusted, he noticed multiple flags in the distance. All bore a maple leaf, blood red. 
 
 A lone Mountie emerges from the haze, looking calm and collected. He slowly raised his gun. The barrel was pointed strait at Jonathon's head, and suddenly, he pulled the trigger. The time traveler's cold, lifeless body fell to the ground, blood pooling ay his murderer's boots. 
 
 The Mountie holstered his pistol, looked down, and muttered one single word before disappearing again into the cold wasteland. 
 
 `` Sorry.''

He extricated himself from the fiery vortex, his senses tingling from the particulate assault. Looking up, he surveyed the barren wasteland that once held the promise of life. The verdant tapestry of earth had been devoured by the insatiable fire of time, leaving behind only desolate dirt and acrid smoke. The air choked with an oppressive haze, casting a sickly grey tint over all that met his eyes.

Multiple flags, adorned with a crimson maple leaf, pierced the horizon like skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. A solitary Mountie emerged from the haze, his stoic expression unyielding. His gaze met Jonathan's, and the cold steel of his pistol reflected the fiery sunset. In an instant, the Mountie's finger danced across the trigger, a symphony of violence resonating through the wasteland. Jonathan's lifeless body collapsed onto the cold earth, blood spreading like a morbid halo around the Mountie's boots.

The Mountie expertly holstered his weapon, his gaze lingering on the fallen traveler. With a single word, he muttered into the abyss, ""Sorry,"" and vanished back into the wasteland, leaving Jonathan's fate in the hands of the unforgiving future."
"When I was in fourth grade, my teacher assigned us a paper. The prompt was,'Why do you think you are pulled to your bonding-place?' Most of the kids in my class wrote about their house. They wrote about their families, or some important childhood memory. One kid wrote about a football stadium, and how he would go there for every home game with his grandpa. But my paper was blank. 
 
 My teacher was n't too concerned. It was n't uncommon for young kids to not have a bonding-place yet. But when she explained that to me, I told her that was n't the issue. I *had* a bonding-place. The stars. 
 
 *That* made her concerned. 
 
 Fourth grade was almost fifteen years ago. Fifteen years of therapists, counselors, doctors, the works. It's been an absolute hell. I just want to live a normal life, but the adults around me refuse to let me. Some people accuse me of lying. Most, actually. But I'm telling the truth. 
 
 It was n't until now that I finally got the vindication I deserved. All those years of torment and anguish, they were worth it. Because I finally got to visit the stars. 
 
 When the aliens came to Earth, they were not there to wage war. Nor were they there to ask for help, or to form an alliance of some kind. They came seeking answers. 
 
 These aliens had developed far beyond humans; billions of years beyond us, in fact. They had the capability to test atoms to see how old they were. And as it turns out, the oldest atoms in the universe are in my body. 
 
 All of the people who ridiculed me, the people who were convinced I was crazy or lying, they finally believed me. But I do n't care about them any more. Because I've escaped them. I've escaped humanity. I've escaped Earth. I've even escaped my physical form. My atoms are now spread out across the stars, a beacon for the only people who ever appreciated me; people who were n't even the same species as me. When my journey is done, they will find me, reasemble me, and we'll discover all of the universe's greatest secrets, together. 
 
 I'm finally home, among the stars.
"," Use the bold and brash language of a Viking warrior, full of conquest and exploration.","My brash Viking spirit rages like the windstorm that whips through the plains of old. The stars, my bonding-place, dance above me like the fiery glow of a dragon's tail.

In the fourth grade, I penned a paper about my enigmatic connection to the celestial tapestry. While my classmates waxed poetic about their homes or cherished memories, I painted a canvas of cosmic wonder. The teacher, perplexed by my unconventional muse, questioned the validity of my celestial sanctuary. Alas, I had to explain that I was not bereft of a bonding-place. I had the boundless expanse of the stars.

The journey to this celestial haven has been arduous, steeped in years of torment and anguish. Yet, I persist, driven by the unwavering belief that the truth must be unveiled. To my detractors, I say this: your skepticism and disbelief were misplaced. I am a man of honor, a warrior of spirit, and a traveler of the cosmos.

When the ethereal beings descended upon Earth, they sought answers to the riddles of existence. It was not to engage in battle or forge alliances, but to explore the secrets of the universe. And as fate would have it, I was the conduit of their cosmic curiosity. I have the distinction of housing the oldest atoms in the universe within my frail mortal frame.

The doubters, the naysayers, they finally believed me. But I do not dwell on their validation. My journey has been arduous, marked by both physical and emotional scars. I have escaped the shackles of humanity, the confines of Earth, and the physical limitations of my mortal form. My atoms dance freely among the stars, a testament to the boundless potential of the human spirit.

When my journey concludes, the celestial tapestry will once again be my companion. I will be reborn, my atoms meticulously rearranged, and together, we will unravel the mysteries of the universe."
"The reunion was not disappointing, it simply lacked. The butterflies flittering about the stomachs of the attendees as they straightened their collars and curled their hair, never seemed to burst into flight, to have their existence justified. Meeting old friends, and old enemies, is a nervous affair that often fails to deliver on the promised significance. The Wilson High class of'95 seemed to quickly find themselves drowning in small talk and punch that was barely cool enough to not be considered downright `` warm''. Alex carefully stacked cookies on the tiny white paper plates and balanced the whole affair on top of his cup as he turned to face the ensemble of people that used to matter to him. He scanned the room for any vaguely familiar face and found one after his eyes took a few trips around the room. He stepped forward and felt his smile come right on cue as he made eye contact. 
 
 `` Alex!'' 
 
 `` Maaaaaaaark.'' 
 
 The friends clasped hands and then pulled closer to semi-embrace. 
 
 Mark wore khakis and and a blue stafford long sleeve. He was average height but still stood a little taller than Alex. He seemed to study alex as he released the embrace and continued his pattern of small talk. 
 
 `` how's the family?'' 
 
 `` Same ol, same ol. You know how it is.'' Alex half chuckled as he responded. 
 
 `` I do.'' 
 
 Alex took a drink of punch as he looked around the room. 
 
 `` Man we had some good times here huh?'' 
 
 It was Mark's turn to chuckle. 
 
 `` Yeah I guess we did. Do you ever miss it?'' 
 
 `` No, not really. I miss being that young, but that's about it.'' 
 
 they shared a laugh generated by the mutual knowledge of what it feels like to slowly lose your youth. 
 
 Alex cracked a joke about missing the girls more than anything and then they both took a moment to compare their evaluations of their former female classmates beauty. Some had aged well, many had not. 
 
 Mark held up his own paper plate which was previously laden with cookies but now held only one survivor. 
 
 `` Honestly right now i'm just wishing they served real food.'' 
 
 `` They never did back then, why would they start now?'' 
 
 They both thought that was funny. Mark held up his last cookie, 
 
 `` I've seen AA meetings that were better catered than this.'' 
 
 Alex seemed to laugh a little nervously but continued the joke. 
 
 `` AA meetings probably have better seating too.'' 
 
 Their laughter trailed off slowly as the both took drinks and thought of something else to talk about.
"," Adopt Wilde's witty and epigrammatic style, with a flair for the dramatic and a keen observation of society.","The reunion was a disappointment, not because it lacked merriment and nostalgia, but because the butterflies that danced in the stomachs of attendees, never took flight to dance freely.

Alex, a master of delicate balance, carefully arranged his cookies on tiny paper plates, a testament to his meticulous nature. As he surveyed the room for a glimpse of familiarity, his eyes scanned the faces that had graced his youth, and a smile bloomed upon his countenance.

""Alex!""

""Maaaaaaaark!""

The old friends embraced, their joy evident in their clasped hands and elongated hugs. Mark, adorned in khakis and a stafford long-sleeve, stood tall, his stature accentuated by an inflated ego. His gaze locked with Alex, and a wave of memories washed over him.

""How's the family?""

""Same old, same old. You know how it is,"" Alex chuckled, his humor bordering on self-deprecation.

""I do.""

Alex took a sip of punch, his eyes reflecting the amber glow of the vintage lighting.

A chuckle echoed through the room.

""Yeah, I guess we did. Do you ever miss it?""

""No, not really. I miss being that young, but that's about it,"" Alex replied, his voice tinged with melancholy.

They shared a laugh, a testament to their shared experience of youth fading and the passage of time. As the night wore on, they reminisced about their former classmates, their voices rising and falling like the waves on the shore. The cookies were devoured, the punch flowed, and the memories danced in their hearts.

With a mischievous grin, Alex cracked a joke about missing the girls more than anything. Mark held up his paper plate, laden with devoured cookies, his appetite seemingly boundless. The reunion, once promising much, delivered little in the way of substance, yet it served as a catalyst for rekindling old bonds and creating new memories. As the clock struck midnight, the attendees began to depart, leaving Alex and Mark alone in their reminiscence."
"`` It's a combination of multiple things. You ca n't expect your font to look professional if you constantly use slang. It puts you in the wrong mindset. Push the vowels, do n't mumble. We'll start with an easy power phrase. Repeat after me:'I'm the boss here.''' 
 
 The professor scanned the room and looked for fine details in the text that came up as they spoke together. The class had a size limit so he could see each of his student's text as they ticked on display word by word. The sentences hovered steady above their heads, each in varying thickness and size. 
 
 `` Blue shirt, Alyssa right? Your font is a bit small. You want to hear it louder in your mind, show us you're not afraid. You wrote you were a Prosecutor in your introduction post if I remember correctly. You've got to show the jury you know what you're talking about. Show me some strength.'' He flexed his bicep to accentuate the point. 
 
 Each of his students was aiming to learn for their unique purposes. Richard left side was a weatherman who needed a cleaner font for the cameras. Heather dead center was a petite nurse whose patients took one look at her thin, bubbly font and proceeded to ignore all of her professional advice. Font shaping was a useful skill taken alongside rhetoric and speech to give people a new sense of power in their voice. Color theory stayed in the music department where conductors could chisel delicate blue or shocking pink fonts from the more talented. 
 
 `` New phrase everyone. All together now,'I'm in control. Listen to me.''' He articulated carefully to hit all of the key points he skimmed over in his lesson. 
 
 Professor Barker did n't expect much of a change from each phrase. First day lessons were only to set up class dynamics and give a few examples to the students so they would how an everyday class might go, plus answering syllabus questions. Again he screened over each font and took in the styles, focusing on the general strengths and weaknesses like a chef would inspect his fresh ingredients before a recipe. 
 
 He noticed the young brunette in the far back right, lips sealed at each prompt. It was n't uncommon for a student to be shy about their font, especially since attending his class implied there were some things to fix about it. He privately pinged her desk - `` Do n't be afraid to join in, you can even use a quiet font for right now. Nobody will see but me, and I promise I wo n't judge.'' 
 
 He instructed the class through another set of phrases and kept a curious eye on her. He did n't want to hone in too intently and intimidate her even more, so he lazily scanned the room and paused over her font for a brief moment. And wow. 
 
 He'd never seen anything like it.. The way the words flowed into one another elegantly, all connected like vines growing into one another. The lines themselves were thin like a woman's fine eyeliner. The g's and y's looped in a way that was n't bubbly but had a confident layer of something mysterious, feminine, ancient. 
 
 She saw the way his eyes lit up at her repetition. She whispered and he knew by the volume that it was meant only for him. The letters twirled above her.

"The camera sat on the table, just waiting for use. 
 Years had gone by, and temptation grew, thinking about what it knew. 
 Objects, the only thing it had seen, how could that be? 
 Seconds and minutes gave a goodbye, I needed to know what it thought of me. 
 
 I took a step, a step closer indeed. 
 I peered over, grabbing it with need. 
 In front, was a mirror, my reflection beaming. 
 What would it tell me? Unsure I seemed. 
 
 Through the lens, I looked, 
 How ugly I appeared, nothing like the words of a book. 
 As invisible as I was, I understood. 
 The camera I had used, was abused, not as it should.
"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","Ladies and Gentlemen, gather around as I unveil this tale of the camera and its encounter with the mirror. A tale spun with the grace of a feather and the strength of a lion.

Once upon a time, a camera stood proudly on a table, its lens gleaming like a star on a clear night sky. Time, like the tides, had danced around it, whispering secrets and tempting fate. Objects, the only companions it had known, danced through its viewfinder, leaving behind a trail of memories.

In a moment of longing, I approached the camera, my heart pounding with anticipation. With a single step, I drew closer, my desire to know guiding me. I peered over the lens, my reflection mirroring me in the glass. The mirror's truth struck me, revealing my flaws, my imperfections, like a cruel artist's brushstrokes.

The camera, once a tool of beauty and creation, had become an instrument of self-destruction. I understood that I had abused its power, treating it as a mere object rather than a treasured companion. As I stood there, my heart filled with shame and remorse, I knew I had to rectify my actions.

So, my dear audience, let us learn from this tale. Let us cherish the power of the camera, and use it to capture the beauty that lies within each of us. And let us remember, as I have, that true beauty comes from within, not from the reflection of a mirror."
"From the very walls he came, invading my home. When I awoke this morning I did n't know I would be fighting for my life, all to keep him away from what I was sworn to protect. I was n't prepared the injuries, god the injuries, I do n't know how much longer I can hold off this invader, how much longer I can survive, I can barely move. He turned my house into a weapon, riddled with cruel traps of his design. Where did he even get explosives, how'd he learn to maneuver my home better than I ever could? I can hardly get a good look at him, he managed to turn every pursuit, every capture, every time I thought I was near victory into another opportunity to destroy a part of me, staying only long enough to gleefully carry out his punishment. The sadistic bastard! But I have a duty! Right here, in this room, in front of the fridge he has fought to hard to raid, bloodied and mangled, I make my last stand.

"It all started on Halloween. I was an exchange student in Rome and me and some friends had gone out to party. I myself had dressed up as the Holy Father himself, Pope Francis. To be honest I looked pretty darn convincing. I had the glasses and I even had died my hair so that it looked gray. 
 
 Anyway, me and my friends went to a few parties and we ended up getting so drunk that we had to take a cab back to our hostel. Unfortunately the cab drive got lost and we ended up somewhere near Saint Peter's. The drive then kicked us out and cursed us in Italian. We then wandered around and decided to just sit on some steps just outside of Vatican City. All of a sudden we saw a man in a black cassock come towards us. 
 
 He started talking to us in Italian, and then what I assumed was Spanish. Then he said `` Oh Americano. You need help? Come eat with me!'' However someone snuck up behind the old man and stabbed him. He then ran off but a group of Swiss Guards chased him down. He was then caught. We then just stood there and watched until one of the guards came up and started talking to us. They then took me away into Vatican City. 
 
 `` What's wrong?'' I asked the guard. I could n't quite understand what he was saying but I think he said something to the effect of `` You ca n't be doing stuff like this Francis.'' I then replied. `` No signore, no es Francesco'' in my broken italian spanglish. The guard then laughed. Just then I saw another Cardinal. I then heard him talk and he was definitely American. `` Grazie Francesco. I hope you'll be more careful out there.'' 
 
 `` Look can you help me? I'm not Pope Francis. Really i'm not him.'' 
 
 `` I see you've been working on your English. Preparing for your next visit to the states eh?'' 
 
 `` No i'm serious.'' 
 
 The Cardinal then walked away. I was then taken to the Papal apartments and then the guard walked away. I then saw the opulence of the apartment and thought to myself `` It's good to be the Pope!''
", Adopt the formal and polite manner of speech characteristic of a Victorian gentleman or lady.,"My esteemed guest, esteemed reader, I embark upon a narrative that chronicles an extraordinary encounter on a hallow evening in Rome, where fate intertwined with a series of events that befit the enigmatic tapestry of life.

The festivities commenced on the hallowed eve of Halloween, where I, adorned in the guise of the Holy Father himself, Pope Francis, captivated the night with my captivating presence. To my astonishment, the likeness of the pontiff was meticulously crafted, complete with the distinctive glasses and the weathered hair that belied my youthful vigor.

As the revelry unfolded, an intoxicating elixir of merriment led us to a night of merriment, culminating in an inebriated state that necessitated the summoning of a cab to return to our hostel. Alas, fate took a cruel turn, and the cab driver, misguided by the intoxicating allure of the evening, deviated from our intended course, leading us astray near Saint Peter's Basilica. The driver's temper flared, and he unceremoniously ejected us from his vehicle, his profane tongue echoing through the streets.

In a moment of bewilderment, we wandered aimlessly, fate guiding us to a solemn sight. A man clad in a black cassock approached us, his voice dripping with an alien tongue. As he extended his hand, I discerned an unsettling glint in his eyes, and a sense of foreboding permeated my being. However, fate took a swift turn, and a sinister act marred the tranquility of the evening. A stealthy hand, driven by malice, pierced the old man's chest, leaving a trail of blood that stained the steps.

The perpetrator, fleeing the scene of his crime, was pursued by a group of vigilant Swiss Guards. With lightning speed, they apprehended him, bringing justice to the victim. The aftermath of the tragedy unfolded, and I found myself amidst a surreal scene. The Swiss Guard, his voice dripping with concern, approached me, his words echoing through the halls of Vatican City.

""What's wrong, Francis?"" he inquired, his voice laced with empathy. I responded with my broken Italian, ""No signore, no es Francesco,"" a testament to my humble stature and the misconception that had befallen me. The guard burst into laughter, his merriment a stark contrast to the somber mood that permeated the air.

As I stood there, bewildered and alone, I encountered a Cardinal, his eyes filled with compassion and understanding. ""Look can you help me? I'm not Pope Francis. Really I'm not him,"" I pleaded, my voice trembling. The Cardinal approached me, his smile radiating warmth, ""I see you've been working on your English. Preparing for your next visit to the states eh?''

I replied, ""No I'm serious,"" my voice tinged with humility. The Cardinal nodded, his eyes brimming with admiration. ""Grazie Francesco. I hope you'll be more careful out there,"" he remarked. With a sense of gratitude, I watched the Cardinal walk away, his footsteps fading into the distance.

In the aftermath of the ordeal, I was escorted to the Papal apartments, a testament to the opulence and grandeur that befit the head of the Catholic Church. As I stood amidst the lavish furnishings and gilded ornaments, I couldn't help but marvel at the profound irony of my journey and the extraordinary encounters that had shaped it.

My dear reader, the tapestry of life is woven with threads of both joy and adversity. Through the tumultuous events that unfolded that fateful night in Rome, I emerged unscathed, a testament to the resilience and strength of the human spirit. And so, I conclude this narrative, leaving you with a profound sense of wonder and admiration for the myriad experiences that life has to offer."
"Day 1: 
 
 We have officially passed the Surface. It is… strange here. It is like what are scientists told us and more. We are currently camped at the edge of the surface and what they call “ land ”. We hope to explore it tomorrow but have to charge our breathing tanks overnight. There may not be much water for us to use as we begin our journey. My heart is pounding. I am beyond excited to see what lies out there. 
 
 Day 2: 
 
 We have explored land. Everything is so dry up here. How could anything live up here without water? When I swing my arms back and forth, it feels like nothing is there. And the pressure is so low. If not for these suits, I fear what would happen to mine and my associates ’ bodies. 
 
 But what really has intrigued me are the animals here. They come in a variety of sizes, from small to big. In fact, I saw this really small one earlier today. It was covered in the most precarious little hairs and with huge black eyes. I wish I could have touched it. It looked so soft. 
 
 And then there were things that floated around. But they are not like fish swimming above. They seem to glide all around by beating their fins. Those are covered in some strange coating. They perch in the large plants. My colleague called them “ trees ”. Absolutely fascinating. 
 
 Day 3: 
 
 While collect samples to bring back, I noticed something strange. I could have sworn I saw something watching us, hidden in the dense bundles of plants surrounding us. They did not look like any other animal we had seen so far – no hair or flier things. But I did not think much about it, considering there is so much to explore. 
 
 That was, until a person in our group went missing. She went off to collect some rocks, barely gone a minute before we heard her scream. By the time we had arrived to where she was, nothing remained except for her broken helmet. Without it, she is as good as dead. 
 
 And that was when I began to panic. No one else has said anything but I think they feel the same. We are scheduled to leave in the morning at daybreak. I can not complain. Something is not right about this place. 
 
 Day 4: 
 
 I am the only one left. At least, I think so. It all happened a blur. I am still trying to figure out what happened. 
 
 One moment, I had taken a nap camp. The next, those savages come out of nowhere and attacked. They killed a few of us and chased the survivors in different directions. I was lucky enough to get them off my trail. But now, I do not know where I am. 
 
 Their screams still ring in my ears. It was… brutal, unrestrained. They seem to kill for no reason. Just who are they? 
 
 I have to sleep. It is a danger I must risk. If I can make it through the night, I will get back to the ship. Gods be with me. 
 
 Day 5: 
 
 There is no hope. After a day ’ s long trek, I made it back to the ship. But they arrived first. Now, they hang around it, speaking in some foreign tongue. And over the bodies of my dead comrades at that! They put them over some strange yellow and orange energy that radiates light, witchcraft perhaps. Their skin browns, crinkling and reeking of death. I had to hold my breath to not vomit. 
 
 I have no choice. I have to try to get the ship back. My water levels are low and I lack a weapon but I must at least try. I need to warn my people of the impending doom if they dare to pass the Surface like we foolishly did. No one deserves this fate. So here is my final message. 
 
 If I do not make it, whoever finds this log please heed my words. These savages will stop at nothing to kill you. Leave while you still can.
"," Channel the powerful lyrical style of Tupac, blending social commentary with personal reflection.","The barren wasteland of the Surface, a testament to humanity's insignificance in the face of the cosmos. The stark landscape unfolds a story of aridity and mystery, a canvas painted in shades of ochre and barrenness.

As we cautiously ventured onto the land, our senses were met with the aridity that permeated the atmosphere. The pressure was low, and the air was thin, threatening to engulf us. The barrenness of the land mirrored the emptiness within our hearts, a sobering reminder of the fleeting nature of life.

The creatures that inhabit this unforgiving terrain were a source of fascination and awe. From the delicate, hairless creatures with piercing eyes to the gliding fin-bearers that danced through the air, each encounter etched a memory upon our minds.

Yet, tragedy struck on the third day, casting a pall of darkness over our spirits. The disappearance of a colleague, swallowed by the unforgiving landscape, served as a sobering reminder of the fragility of life. As we searched frantically, hope dwindled with every passing moment, leaving us with nothing but a broken helmet and a shattered dreams.

In the aftermath of that tragedy, panic consumed me. I felt as if the walls of the universe were closing in on me, crushing my spirit. My colleagues, though shaken, remained stoic, their resilience serving as a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.

In this barren wasteland, I found a profound connection to the interconnectedness of life and the boundless beauty that lay beyond the boundaries of human understanding. The Surface may be a hostile and unforgiving place, but it is also a canvas for discovery, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and a reminder that even amidst the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope."
"I love the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory. 
 
 I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all. 
 
 Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment where… One moment where the sound was deafening. 
 
 There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn ’ t change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke. 
 
 “ The World Trade Centers have been hit. ” I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet. 
 
 As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.
"," Model the text on a Regency romance novel, focusing on social gatherings, romantic pursuits, and the strict manners of the era.","The Regency era was a time of great societal upheaval and refinement, characterized by strict social manners, lavish balls, and a burgeoning literary culture. Within this intricate tapestry of society, the exquisite art of music played a pivotal role in shaping the elegant gatherings that adorned the aristocratic halls.

The music that echoed through the Regency era was a reflection of the emotions and aspirations that underpinned the social gatherings of the era. It was a powerful tool employed to set the mood, create atmosphere, and convey nuanced expressions of joy, sorrow, and anticipation.

The grandest of social gatherings were steeped in the symphony of music. The orchestras crafted intricate melodies, each note meticulously selected to evoke the desired emotional response. The dance floor pulsed with the rhythm of the music, as couples embraced, their movements harmonizing with the melody.

Beyond the realm of the aristocracy, music also permeated the lives of ordinary folk. From the humble tavern to the grandest estate, music served as a bridge between people of all social strata. It was a universal language, capable of transcending barriers, fostering unity, and conveying stories.

"`` Where do we go now?'' She sat down beside me, but I did not answer. The sun slowly continued falling down to earth, burning the blue sky red as it fell. The grass underneath us felt cool and soft, so different from the broken burning asphalt that we had been walking on all day. I looked down at my shoes - rags really. I ca n't remember what color they were before. When did I find them? 
 
 `` Road's gone,'' I finally grunted after the silence grew too heavy. 
 
 `` Yeah.'' She nodded, and we fell back into quiet. The giant stony path that we had been following had finally gotten lost in the forest. Trees had broken the surface and had torn it apart. For weeks the going had been slow, occasionally loosing the path before we could find it again sometimes miles later. A day of walking and we had well and truly lost it. 
 
 `` What about the train tracks?'' I said, `` We could see where they take us?'' 
 
 She shrugged and pushed herself up, `` Why not? They've got to so somewhere right?'' 
 
 `` Yeah. I suppose they do.'' I too stood up, `` At least it should n't be too hard to find some fire wood tonight. How many can's of beans to we have left?'' 
 
 `` Six. And a can of peaches.''
"," Adopt the gritty, laconic style of a noir detective, with a dark, atmospheric tone.","In the dim, dying light, the grass beneath me felt cool as the sun dipped behind the trees, casting long, melancholic shadows. The scent of damp earth and fallen leaves filled my nostrils, a symphony of decay and decay. I stared at my worn shoes, their color fading like the memories of a life long lost.

The silence was broken only by the chirping of crickets and the distant howl of a lone wolf. I looked at the woman sitting beside me, her face etched with the same weariness as the worn leather cover of a book. Her eyes were closed, and her head rested on her lap, as if seeking solace in the twilight.

""Road's gone,"" I muttered, my voice gruff as a winter wind. The giant stone path we had been following had been swallowed by the forest, leaving only a faint trace of its former existence. Weeks of walking had taken their toll, and we had lost the trail for the second time.

But I offered a suggestion, as I always did, a beacon in the storm. ""What about the train tracks?"" I asked, ""We could see where they take us?""

She shrugged, her defiance waning. ""Why not?"" she said, her voice as thin as a wisp of smoke. ""They've got to go somewhere right?""

I nodded, my agreement with her sentiment. At least there would be a fire, and plenty of food. ""Yeah, I suppose they do,"" I said, standing up. ""At least it should n't be too hard to find some firewood tonight. How many cans of beans to we have left?""

""Six,"" she replied, her voice barely a whisper. ""And a can of peaches.""

In that moment, I felt a sense of shared despair. The world was a cruel and unforgiving place, and the only thing we had was each other. As the stars began to twinkle above us, I knew that our journey was far from over. But I also knew that we would survive, one can of beans and one can of peaches at a time."
"There is a visceral majesty to some things that no art can quite capture. It's a poor attempt at replicating the awe inspired by the universe's grandest undertakings when we supplement one art with another. A play might have an accompanying score to impress upon the audience just how struck those beholding a spectacle are. A painting of a splendid natural scene, gorgeous and accurate as can be, will never be a replacement for seeing that same scene with one's own eyes. Drinking in whatever strange magics there are that make our senses so much *more* when we're there. 
 
 It was precisely this sort of wonder that washed over my crew and I six weeks after we'd left the map. Even now, having had ample time to collect my thoughts, I can not describe how beautiful it was. I can try. 
 
 An ocean of difference separates a view of a middling pond from a vista overlooking a lake. Vaster still is the staggering difference of both physical and experiential scale between such a lake and the sea, stretching off into the horizon and beyond. Given infinite time, I doubt any work of men could ever outstrip the splendor of the heavens on a clear night. 
 
 What we saw towers over any of this. Over anything I or my crew have ever seen, conceived, or dared to dream. Where some thought the Earth might curve and never terminate, others claimed to know our world as finite, guessing at a waterfall of sorts. None could explain where the water would go, or for that matter where it would come from, but that did not deter them - nor did it deter Mother Nature. 
 
 At the end of the world a waterfall rushes with all the fury of the entire salted sea, cascading away with reckless abandon. No longer trusting any assumption, I can only say that it *seems* to stretch on without end, but regardless that is not what impresses. 
 
 The waterfall at the edge of the world flows upward. 
 
 It flows upward and the water shimmers and ripples and shines, and it becomes the heavens and tells me what true beauty is even as it destroys. Destroys the water. Destroys what we thought we knew about the world. Destroys what we thought we knew about gravity. Destroys *us* as we ride the current up into the stars. 
 
 I will cast this journal back down to the Earth with all the strength I can muster in the hopes that man might learn and understand something of the truth. It is my sincere hope that the prospect of death does not deter any man, woman, or child from undertaking this voyage, for knowing now the face of God I can not in good conscience condone rejecting Him out of some petty fear.
"," Use the bewildered and insightful language of a time traveler, navigating different eras.","There is a visceral majesty to certain experiences that no art can entirely replicate. It is the awe-inspiring sensation of witnessing the universe's grandest creations, a feeling that can only be fully experienced by being there. 

Six weeks after leaving the map, my crew and I encountered a breathtaking spectacle that washed over me with a profound sense of wonder. Even now, having had ample time to reflect, I am still unable to adequately describe its beauty. I can attempt to convey the experience, but the words fail to capture the full magnitude and scope of the awe that I felt.

The sheer scale of a lake, compared to the vastness of the ocean, is staggering. It is as if a middling pond is a mere puddle of water in comparison to the boundless expanse of the sea. Given infinite time, I doubt any human endeavor could ever rival the splendor of the heavens on a clear night.

What we witnessed was far grander than any artistic representation. It surpassed anything I or my crew had ever seen, conceived, or dared to dream. The waterfall at the end of the world flowed with the fury of the entire salted sea, cascading downward with reckless abandon. It seemed to stretch on without end, but that is not what impressed me the most.

The water shimmered and rippled and shone, and it became the heavens. It flowed upward, revealing the secrets of the universe, and whispered tales of creation and destruction. It was a moment of profound connection to the natural world, where art and reality danced in harmony."
"Unrequited love is the worst kind of suffering a man can endure. I pined for her, my Anna. She with the hair like chocolate and her skin as pale as the moon in the sky. She moved like grace through a crowd of sinners, touching each person who had the benefit of knowing her. I was not among the lucky. 
 
 High school ended and the years softened the ache that had settled within me. I went through relationships like colds, seeing her face in each and moving on. I learned she left our small town and with her went my chance at happiness, but I was happy for her. Truly I was. 
 
 It was a cold day in December when I saw her again. She wore the years apart like the fine scarf wrapped around her neck and her eyes reflected the places I imagined she'd been. With nothing more to lose, I said hello and she spoke to me. I offered her a cup of coffee and a place to warm up and she agreed with a smile that I would've killed to see in high school. 
 
 By the end of our impromptu date, I'd learned that she had indeed seen the world, had been to places I could only imagine and done things she was hesitant to talk about. We each had our demons and I knew a girl as beautiful as Anna had surely made her own share of mistakes with men. 
 
 Reluctantly, she agreed to a second date. Then a more enthusiastic third. I was in love before our first kiss, shared on the bleachers behind our old high school under a full moon. I learned she liked to bite when she kissed, a quirk I fell in love with. It was heaven on earth. 
 
 I dropped her off that night already planning on the ring and proposal. She liked emeralds over diamonds. White gold over yellow. She was a simple girl with simple pleasures, just looking to rediscover her roots and settle down. 
 
 The sensation came to me in a flood. I knew it meant that she loved me back and I rejoiced. It was a common bond that could never be broken. She was truly my souls mate. 
 
 I stopped for flowers in the morning and noticed the cashier as if for the first time. She walked weakly on her left foot, perhaps due to an old cheer-leading injury. She was slow and I knew I could break her neck as quickly as a cat's and deposit her body behind the dumpsters where no one would discover it until I was safely out of town. 
 
 I vomited and left the building without the flowers, leaving the cashier with a questioning look upon her face. My Anna had the answers and I knew it would be a rational one. 
 
 She was sitting on the sofa with eyes that looked like she'd spent the night crying. She embraced me when she saw me and my fears evaporated in the air between us. There had to be an explanation. This was meant to be a happy occasion after all, but even as I held her, I knew I thought of all the ways I could kill her and how easy it would be to slip a knife between her third and fourth rib into her heart. 
 
 My eyes strayed to the kitchen. I felt her heart beating against my chest and thought of the ways I could separate it from her body. I knew it would have to be cooked on a low heat to keep in the juices and that the human heart was best paired with Pinot Noir. I loved her and in spite of myself, my stomach grumbled.
"," Adopt the optimistic and imaginative tone of a retro futurist, envisioning a utopian future.","In the tapestry of time, where dreams danced with reality, I find myself reminiscing about a vibrant era, an era sculpted by an optimistic spirit and adorned with the promise of a utopian future. As I cast my gaze back to the past, I vividly recall the captivating beauty of my Anna. Her hair flowed like chocolate, as pale as the moon illuminating the heavens above. With each step she took, grace danced through the crowd, touching hearts and igniting dreams. Unfortunately, I was not among the fortunate souls to be graced by her presence.

High school ended, the years ushered in a tide of healing, and I found solace in fleeting relationships. Yet, I still mourned the loss of Anna, the dream that slipped away like grains of sand. Nevertheless, I embraced the joy of her departure, recognizing that her journey had led her to extraordinary experiences.

Fate intervened on a cold December day, bringing me face to face with her once more. The years had etched their passage upon her face, yet her eyes sparkled with the same celestial glow. With nothing to lose, I uttered a greeting and she responded with a smile that illuminated the room. I offered her a cup of coffee and a warm place to thaw, and she graciously accepted.

As the hours flew by, I learned about her travels, the places she had visited, and the experiences she had accumulated. Each story unveiled a new facet of her soul, and I felt a profound connection to her. We both carried our own burdens, yet I knew that in each other, we found solace and understanding.

With love blossoming, I offered her a second date, then a third, until the irresistible force of our attraction consumed me. Under the watchful eye of the full moon, I confessed my feelings, and she reciprocated with a passion that ignited my heart. It was a moment of surrender, a testament to the enduring power of love and the transformative ability of human connection.

As I slipped the emerald ring onto her finger, I knew that this bond was unbreakable, a bond rooted in shared dreams and unwavering support. We were two souls intertwined, each complementing the other perfectly. With each passing day, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the gift of her presence in my life.

In the tapestry of time, where dreams danced with reality, I am grateful for the day I met Anna. She is my soulmate, my forever, my testament to the enduring power of love and the transformative ability of human connection."

 I swallowed my pint. Everyone around me was drunk, and with good reason. We'd been glued to the news all day. A real morbid party atmosphere was breaking out in every major city. I tunes the noise out and focused on the subtitles.

"," Adopt the optimistic and imaginative tone of a retro futurist, envisioning a utopian future.","The scene unfolded before me like a dystopian painting, the scent of destruction permeating the air. The atmosphere was thick with an unsettling silence, punctuated only by the occasional groan or sigh of those trapped in the chaos. The news, a constant stream of harrowing reports, painted a picture of a world on the brink of collapse. Yet, amidst the despair, a glimmer of hope emerged, emanating from the shared experience and resilience of the human spirit.

The conversation, though laced with anger and frustration, was laced with an undercurrent of unity and determination. We were all in this together, victims of a tragedy that had shaken the foundations of our society. But we were not broken. We were survivors, bound together by a shared sense of loss and a unwavering belief that we could overcome this obstacle.

As I watched the faces of my fellow revelers, I felt a sense of solidarity. We were all strangers, yet we were all united in our shared humanity. We were all victims of the same fate, yet we were all resilient. And in that moment, I felt a profound connection to each and every person, as if we were all part of the same family.

The day, though filled with tragedy, had also brought about a sense of community and compassion. We had come together, not to mourn, but to support and uplift one another. We had found solace in shared experience, and in the strength of our collective spirit.

As I took a sip of water, I watched the people below me dance and sing, their spirits soaring despite the tragedy that had befallen them. I knew that we were all on the same journey, and that together, we could overcome this adversity."

 Truth was, though, I never really tried anything before really. I never was interested in art or music, and never had any athleticism either. I was n't any good at juggling, I was an OK cook at best, and really could n't hum, let alone sing. About the only thing I really excelled at was work, and how demanding was it to run an industrial paper shredder? 
 
 
 `` Really, I ca n't think of anything Steve,'' I protested. `` I did n't even sign up for this stupid seminar.'' 
 
 
 `` Well, none of us did. Stupid'team building' programs suck. We all get along, do n't we?'' Steve protested. `` Come on, just get up and like, I dunno, hop on one leg in a circle. Anything to get this over with.''

 `` Ugh, fine. I guess I got this little trick I do to take out the trash, but I do n't think it really impressive. Um. Anyone got some trash they need to get rid of?'' 
 
 
 `` Yeah, my last performance review!'' someone shouted from the back, followed by a smattering of laughter. Oh, what a riot we were. 
 
 
 `` OK, there's a trash can; thanks Cindy. All right, everyone watch, here we go,'' I said as I pushed the trash away. `` Yeah, not very impressive, I know,'' I mumbled to silence. And more silence. Finally, it got uncomfortable. `` What? You wanted me to participate; I never said it was a *good* talent, OK?'' 
 
 
 `` How did you do that,'' whispered Jeff, our VP of operations. `` What did you do?'' 
 
 
 `` What? I just, you know, pushed it away.''

With wit as sharp as a blade in flight.

Alas, I am but a humble soul,
Lacking the grace of a gifted artist.
Yet in the realm of work, I find my stride,
And with a shredder, I do confide.

""Oh, come on, Jim,"" I plead,
""Everyone has their own unique thread.
You've got ta be able to do something cool,

But alas, my talent lies not in art,

""I didn't even sign up for this stupid seminar.""

And forces me to take a stand.

""Is someone still shy? Come on, let's meet.
Everyone has a unique talent to share,
Let's see how this star shines.""

With a sigh, I join the throng,
And push the trash away, with all my might.
But alas, my performance is far from grand,
And the silence echoes through the land.

""What? You wanted me to participate?"" I say,
""I never said it was a good talent, OK?""
So I stand there, my spirit broken,
And the laughter of my colleagues spoken."
"FADE IN: 
 
 INT. AN APARTMENT - DAY 
 
 *A young man sits on a couch, a laptop computer open on the coffee table in front of him. This is DAVE. His face shows visible awe and excitement as he reads through something on the screen. * 
 
 **DAVE: ** I knew it. I knew it! 
 **STEVE: ** ( *O.S. * ) What? 
 
 *A second young man walks into view. This is STEVE, Dave's roommate. * 
 
 **DAVE: ** I've achieved immortality! 
 **STEVE: ** Is that some kind of video game perk? 
 **DAVE: ** No, I mean that I have literally become immortal. I probably always was! 
 
 *Steve stares at Dave for a few seconds. * 
 
 **STEVE: ** I'm assuming there's a joke coming. 
 **DAVE: ** No jokes. 
 **STEVE: ** So, you've just gone crazy, then. Got it. 
 **DAVE: ** No, look, I'm serious! Come read this! 
 
 *Steve rolls his eyes and sits down next to Dave on the couch. * 
 
 **STEVE: ** This is terrible. 
 **DAVE: ** Just read it. 
 **STEVE: ** It's like a high school writing assignment. What is this? Did you write this? 
 **DAVE: ** No, it's just this thing. Keep reading! 
 **STEVE: ** No, this is awful. Look, the title... 
 **DAVE: ** ( *Interrupting* ) That's the prompt. 
 **STEVE: ** The *prompt* has a typo in it, and all of the responses are just people rewriting it in lengthier ways. 
 **DAVE: ** Those are the rules! You have to follow the prompt! 
 **STEVE: ** There's a difference between `` following a prompt'' and just regurgitating it. These people are writers? 
 **DAVE: ** That's not the point. 
 **STEVE: ** Oh, and *this* moron thinks he's some kind of screenwriter. 
 **DAVE: ** ( *Shouting* ) *That's not the point! * Do you get it now? 
 **STEVE: ** I get that you have incredibly low standards. 
 **DAVE: ** About the immortality! 
 
 *Several seconds of silence pass as Steve returns to scanning the screen. * 
 
 **STEVE: ** Nope. I'm not seeing it. 
 **DAVE: ** Look, it's right there: `` Quantum Immortality.'' 
 **STEVE: ** What is that? 
 **DAVE: ** It's... 
 **STEVE: ** ( *Interrupting* ) Other than nonsense, I mean. 
 
 *Dave sighs with evident impatience. * 
 
 **DAVE: ** Let's pretend that you stabbed me, alright? 
 **STEVE: ** We may not have to pretend. 
 **DAVE: ** From *your* perspective, I'd immediately die... but from *my* perspective, I'd survive the wound, because my path would split off into another timeline. 
 **STEVE: ** You've been watching too many bad television shows. 
 **DAVE: ** It's all right here! 
 
 *Dave taps on the laptop's screen. * 
 
 **STEVE: ** You're leaving fingerprints. 
 **DAVE: ** *Immortal* fingerprints! 
 **STEVE: ** Are those... no, never mind, I'm not going to ask. 
 **DAVE: ** The fingerprints of an immortal! 
 **STEVE: ** Yes, that was one option. I'm more worried about the other. 
 **DAVE: ** You knew what you were getting into when you let me use your computer. 
 
 *Steve rubs his forehead. * 
 
 **STEVE: ** Look, let's suppose this `` Quantum Immortality'' thing is real. 
 **DAVE: ** It is. 
 **STEVE: ** That means you'd just go on getting older and older as you jumped from one timeline to another. 
 **DAVE: ** Yes. 
 **STEVE: ** So you'd eventually wind up in a reality that was entirely populated by geriatrics. 
 **DAVE: ** No. 
 **STEVE: ** No? 
 **DAVE: ** No, because in *my* timeline, they'd all die. 
 **STEVE: ** Because you annoyed them to death. 
 
 *Dave looks ready to respond, but seems to stop himself. He stares at Steve for a moment, then grins. * 
 
 **DAVE: ** I can prove it. 
 **STEVE: ** Prove that you're annoying? No need. We have plenty of evidence. 
 **DAVE: ** I can prove that I'm immortal! 
 **STEVE: ** Fine, I'll humor you. How can you prove that you're immortal? 
 **DAVE: ** You would perceive me as dying, right? 
 **STEVE: ** According to your idiotic theory, yes. 
 **DAVE: ** Therefore, if you *stop* perceiving me, it means that I'm dead. 
 **STEVE: **... What? That does n't... 
 **DAVE: ** ( *Interrupting* ) But the moment that you start perceiving me again, I'll be back alive! 
 
 *Dave claps his hands together. * 
 
 **DAVE: ** ( *CONT'D* ) *Something* must *keep* me alive in the interim, right? And it must exist independently of your perception! 
 **STEVE: ** Dave, that's not `` Quantum Immortality.'' You've discovered `` Object Permanence.'' 
 **DAVE: **... Oh. 
 **STEVE: ** Yeah. 
 **DAVE: ** Shit. 
 **STEVE: ** Yep. 
 
 *The silence returns for a moment. * 
 
 **DAVE: ** Do you think `` Object Permanence'' would make a good Writing Prompt? 
 
 FADE OUT.
"," Write with Orwell's clarity and foresight, focusing on political themes and the use of language.","The young man, Dave, sat on the couch, his face alight with awe and excitement. The laptop computer illuminated the dim apartment, casting long shadows upon the wall. His eyes scanned the screen, the words dancing before him.

""I knew it. I knew it!"" Dave exclaimed, his voice dripping with certainty. Steve, his roommate, walked into the room, his curiosity piqued.

""What? You've achieved immortality?"" Steve inquired, his tone laced with disbelief. Dave's grin widened.

""No jokes,"" he declared. ""I'm serious. I have literally become immortal. I probably always was!""

Steve stared at Dave for a moment, his skepticism evident. ""I'm assuming there's a joke coming,"" he muttered. Dave shook his head.

""No jokes,"" he repeated firmly. ""This is the truth. Come read this.""

He handed the laptop to Steve, and as his friend began to read, Dave's enthusiasm began to wane. The text was riddled with grammatical errors and uninspired prose. It was as if the writer had simply copied the prompt and pasted it into their response, word for word.

""This is terrible,"" Steve declared, his voice dripping with disgust. ""It's like a high school writing assignment.""

Dave waved his hand dismissively. ""The prompt has a typo in it, and all of the responses are just people rewriting it in lengthier ways. Those are the rules!""

Steve shook his head. ""There's a difference between following a prompt and just regurgitating it. These people are writers?""

Dave's patience was thin. ""That's not the point,"" he shouted. ""Do you get it now?""

Steve sighed. ""I get that you have incredibly low standards.""

As the silence returned, Dave pointed to the screen. ""Look, it's right there: Quantum Immortality,"" he said.

Steve stared at the screen, his skepticism unwavering. ""What is that?"" he asked. Dave's grin widened.

""It's...,"" he began, but Steve interrupted him.

""Nope. I'm not seeing it,"" Steve declared. ""You're pulling my leg, Dave.""

Dave shook his head in disbelief. ""No, I'm serious. It's quantum immortality!"""
"There are days when the sun shines. It cascades through the leaves overhead, dappling the ground with the semi-starry yellow glow of morning as the wind shushes your mind and keeps you quiet, listening to the lovely sound of silence and birds. And there are days of rain, wet and cool, and cascading susurrance to lull you into a fall nap. 
 
 And there are days of darkness. Not the nighttime kind of darkness that wraps a person up for bed after sunset; more of a forced dark. A cruel dark. Unnatural. Divorce was like that. Unnaturally dark. And darker still when the custody fight over your sixteen year old son got wicked and petty. The fact that you won that fight did n't restore much of the light, either. It just made the cruel dark a little more tolerable. 
 
 It was on just such an unnaturally dark day that James McAdams, or Jimmy Mac as the guys at the poker called him, took his final call. He was navigating his car along Cal State Route 1, humming along to Cat Stevens' Angelsea as it played on the radio. A voice of crystal echo. He glanced above at the malevolent looking clouds that slowly gathered. Fuckin rain. Figures. So much for Davey's pool party. He'd been actually looking forward to his teenaged son's sixteenth birthday bash, and had just filled the pool for the occasion. But now it looked like it was going to be living rooms, rented DVD's and pizza instead of sunshine and barbecue. Meh, probably just as well. That kid would eat pizza every day if he could. 
 
 He slid through traffic, listening as Angelsea came to an end, and Strange Magic started up. Next to him on the passenger seat, his cellphone blipped. He reached around the shotgun rack beside his MDC terminal and picked it up, glancing at the display. It was n't a number he recognized, so he flipped it open and affected the'official tone.' 
 
 `` Corporal McAdams,'' he said, announcing his police rank and last name as greeting. On the other end of the phone was only silence. He waited a beat, said, `` Hello?'' and then abruptly hung up. Not going to sit there crowing at nothing like a magpie. No time or patience for prank callers. Fuck'em. He set the phone back down and slowed for a red light ahead. His cruiser drifted to a stop behind a beat up old red pickup. The phone blipped again. 
 
 McAdams picked it up again, and saw it was the same number. He scowled, flipped it open and said, `` McAdams!'' perhaps more loudly than he needed to. 
 
 ``... Dad?'' a plaintive voice said. McAdams started and dropped the phone. 
 
 `` What the-!'' that voice sounded just like Davey. He bent over awkwardly, his duty belt digging into a belly that his ex-wife had wished was a little less jelly-donut, sweeping his hand across the floor of the cruiser, blindly searching for the dropped phone. Just as his fingers found it, he heard it utter the'beedle-beep' of a disconnected call. He pulled it up towards his face, and was about to say something into it when he discovered a man standing just outside his patrol car's driver's side window. His heart leapt up into his throat, and he dropped the everfucking phone again. 
 
 The man outside the window stared at him, smiling. It took McAdams a moment to gather himself, he'd been startled so badly. He rolled the window down and said, `` What are you doing, standing in the road like that, sir?'' and trying really hard to sound official. It did n't work too well. 
 
 The man said nothing. Just stood there, staring. McAdams glanced over his thin and too-tall frame, noting the dirty dreadlocked hair, pasty white bony complexion, and odd-looking tophat he wore. The red band across the base of the tophat was worn and ripped in places, as was his knotty tweed looking long jacket. The man's eyes were too-dark brown, and swam in rheumy whites. Teeth were straight, a bit yellowed, and far too big to seem normal. And eminating from him was a faint odor of fish. 
 
 McAdams blinked, realized he was staring like an idiot, and shook his head. `` Sir, get back in your car right now!'' he barked. 
 
 For a wonder, the apparition did as bid, turning slowly and padding forward to the driver's door of the ratty pickup. The tall man folded himself inside, the reverse lights blinked as he shifted into drive, and the truck trundled forward, spitting a cloud of smoke behind it. McAdams sat for a brief moment, watching the eerie truck motor away, and refusing to acknowledge how disquieted he suddenly felt, until the motorist behind him tapped his horn to encourage him to move forward. 
 
 From beneath the seat, McAdams' phone blipped again. 
 
 `` Son of a...'' McAdams cursed under his breath and reached down again to retrieve the device. He opened it, and saw that this time it was a text message. From Davey. 

"," Use the expressive and emotional style of a romantic poet, full of passion and natural imagery.","The sun shines in golden cascades, casting dappled shadows on the ground below. A symphony of silence and birdsong fills the air, washing over you like the gentle breeze. Rain falls softly, cascading susurrance, lulling you into a peaceful slumber. But there are days of darkness, unnaturally cruel and pervasive. Divorce, like this oppressive darkness, casts a shadow of despair. It's a force that can crush even the brightest of spirits.

On such a night, as the sky bears witness to the impending storm, fate takes a cruel hand. James McAdams, a man of simple yet noble spirit, finds himself navigating through the treacherous landscape of life's challenges. His heart is filled with the joy of anticipation for his son's sixteenth birthday, yet fate has conspired to shatter his dreams. A storm cloud, menacing in its gathering force, casts a pall over the land.

The wind whips through his hair, carrying with it the scent of impending doom. He hums along to Cat Stevens' Angelsea, his spirit soaring through the night. But fate has a cruel sense of humor, turning his melody into a dirge for his shattered dreams. The radio cuts off, and the silence returns, as he picks up his phone, his mind racing.

With a sigh of resignation, he answers the call, his voice echoing through the empty streets. The line is dead, but he waits, his heart filled with a mix of dread and anticipation. Finally, the phone rings again, and he picks it up, his spirit broken.

The voice on the other end is cold and distant, but it is his. It is the voice of the law, the voice of the cold and unforgiving hand of fate. He listens with a mixture of despair and acceptance, knowing that this is his destiny, his cross to bear."

"," Write with the passionate and informative tone of a wildlife conservationist, advocating for nature.","I am deeply concerned about the rampant destruction of nature and the plight of countless species that call it home. As a wildlife conservationist, I urge you to consider the profound impact human actions are having on the planet.

The destruction of ecosystems, poaching, and climate change are driving a wave of biodiversity loss at an alarming rate. Forests are being cleared at an unprecedented pace, decimating habitats and driving numerous species to the brink of extinction. The illegal trade of wildlife is decimating populations, depriving countless creatures of their homes and livelihoods. Climate change is altering ecosystems, leading to habitat loss, food scarcity, and extreme weather events.

It is not only the loss of species that concerns me but also the profound impact it has on the delicate balance of life. Each species plays a unique role in its ecosystem, and its absence can ripple effects throughout the entire community. The loss of biodiversity threatens the very foundation of life on Earth.

I urge you to take action to protect our precious natural heritage. Support organizations working to conserve wildlife, plant trees, reduce your consumption, and spread the message of conservation. By working together, we can make a difference.

Together, we can protect the countless species that call our planet home. Let us act now to ensure that future generations inherit a world teeming with life."

 Do you really still think you're a hero? Do you even hear what kids say about you now? Parents hold their children a little tighter when you fly by. Do n't tell me you have n't noticed. Do n't expect me to believe your super-senses missed all of this. 
 
 You used to wear a path through the White House carpet; medals, ceremonies, visits with dignitaries, even that ballyhooed prom date... But the phone has n't exactly rung in a while - has it? Do you think that's coincidence? 
 
 You're already a forgone conclusion for so many of these people. Half of them know you'll take us all down when you grow tired of us; half of them know you'll let us all down when the big one comes. You're not their hero any more, Atlas, you're just a ticking time bomb that either blows up in their face or ca n't be defused in time. 
 
 So, this is what I'm offering. I do n't want to kill all of them. I could, and I would... we both know that. I most definitely could. Especially with you, here, in *this* condition. 
 
 But, **for you**, I wo n't. For you, I'll give you the opportunity to be something more for them, something new, something only you can be. 
 
 When I'm done, the world is going to need a hero again. There'll be the illusion of order to restore. There'll be rusted, toppled towers to rebuild. And there will be so much sorrow. Like nothing they've ever known. But we've known it - have n't we Atlas? 
 
 What if I'd come to your family - your race, your planet - so many years ago, and told them I'd let a portion of your people live - to a fraction that I'd even let them decide. Now, I do n't know how your people went, I was n't there for that. But I'm here for this, and so are you. 
 
 One way or the other, I'm going to press a button. I'm going to set this depravity in motion. Even if your powers came back in time, which they **won't**; even if you could stop me like this, which you **can't** - I'm pressing a button. I'm unleashing hell. 
 
 But I leave it up to you to decide which one I'll press. 
 
 So, *which way do you want to fail these people? * 
 
 Do you want genocide on your conscience, or extinction?
"," Recast the narrative in the style of an Arthurian legend, complete with knights, chivalry, and quests for honor.","In the realm of ancient legend, where the mists of time danced with the echoes of valor, there lived an Arthurian hero named Atlas. Once revered as a beacon of hope, his legacy had been marred by the passage of time and the whispers of fate.

As the sun cast long shadows upon the land, Atlas stood at the precipice of his downfall. His former glory had long since faded, leaving behind only memories of a hero once hailed as the savior of the world. The phone that once rang with the promise of greatness now lay silent, a testament to the cruel hand of time.

The people once captivated by his unwavering spirit now held him in contempt. Parents shielded their children as he flew past, their hearts filled with fear and dread. The illusion of his heroics had been shattered, leaving behind only the truth of his impending doom.

But fate, cruel as it may be, offered Atlas a glimmer of redemption. In the face of certain annihilation, he saw an opportunity to make amends for his past transgressions. He understood that the world needed a hero once more, a champion capable of restoring order amidst the ruins of a shattered civilization.

With a mix of compassion and determination, Atlas reached out to the people he had once sought to protect. He offered them a chance to rebuild their lives, a chance to find solace amidst the ruins of the past.

In the end, Atlas's destiny was intertwined with the fate of the world. He knew that his actions would have far-reaching consequences, but he remained undeterred. He understood that the path of a hero is fraught with danger and uncertainty, but he was willing to risk everything to protect the innocent.

And so, as the sun cast its final rays upon the land, Atlas stood tall, a beacon of hope amidst the ruins of a fallen world. He knew that his legacy would live on, inspiring generations to come to believe that even in the darkest of times, the spirit of heroisn can prevail."
"It's nearly 10 pm when you're driving down Basket Creek Road. There are no streetlights. This, combined with a heavy layer of fog, is really making you wish you had woken up a few hours earlier to make the 12 hour drive. It's been a full year since anyone has been to the little mountain home. Weeds have surely obscured the entrance, but sure enough you see a small piece of wood with the number `` 42'' carved into it nailed onto a tree. You're here. 
 
 As you open the car door and step into the long grass, you find yourself again wishing you had gotten here earlier. The thought of snakes hiding in the grass terrifies you. Do snakes go out at night, though? Is it too cold for them? Even on these muggy summer nights? You ca n't remember your snake trivia, so you just hope for the best as you close the car door behind you. 
 
 The once red bridge has been stripped and repainted a dark gray. It sways as you drag your suit case across it. The brook underneath rages. It's been rainy lately. The water level is higher than normal. It helps to mask the problems with erosion that this area in the mountains has been having. 
 
 You reach the small house and look in your bag for the key. Did you remember to bring it? What if you left it at home? Fuck. 
 
 You find it. 
 
 You open the door and turn on the light. It's just the way you remember it. The black and white linoleum floor. Pictures of you and the cousins in the summer over the past 22 years. Pictures of distant relatives who would come up here before you. Some mouse droppings in the corner. You will have to lay out some traps tomorrow, but there's still too much work to do tonight. 
 
 You hate this part, but it's a necessity. You venture into the basement to turn on the water. There are only four stairs to get down there, but they creak loudly enough to alert anything down there of your presence. Not that anything would be down there, save for a few mice and bugs, maybe snakes. Those fears tend to stick with you though, even after childhood. 
 
 The water is turned on and you retreat back upstairs, closing the basement door behind you. You choose the small bedroom to stay in. 
 
 Opening the large trunk at the foot of the bed, you find sheets and pillow cases that somehow do n't smell too bad. Usually you are met with a smell that takes a night or two to get used to. 
 
 You lay down, finally starting to think the long drive was worth it. You fall asleep looking forward to the week ahead of you. 
 
 In the morning you wake up and make a list of things to do for the day. You definitely will have to drive to Callicoon. You wonder if any more shops have closed in the dying little town. Without the `` Flea Market'' you realize that for the first time in 15 years you are n't going to be able to get a Cloisonne figurine to add to your small collection. Luckily though the supermarket, Peck's, is still there. You grab some groceries and as you drive back to the home you check to see which movie is playing this week. `` Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'' is playing for the next two nights. Maybe you'll see it. 
 
 You get back to the home. Spending the day getting ready. You break out the old rider mower, hoping it still has some life in it after all the disuse and mow down the snake-hiding grass. You sweep up the bedrooms, set some mousetraps, and find the old cushions for the porch furniture. 
 
 By the end of the day you are exhausted, but all your hard work will be worth it. Tomorrow your family comes. Then will be the time for the fun. Will you hike the mountain tomorrow? See if the old diving spot about half a mile down the brook is still deep enough? Maybe tube down the Delaware River if the weather looks promising. 
 
 You sometimes wish you could bring other people up here. Sometimes you find yourself describing it to friends or dates or coworkers and they look at you like you are crazy. 
 
 No cell phone service. No internet. No television. Half the time you are here you are cleaning. The place almost always smells or feels damp. Rattlesnakes are fairly common. The nearest town is a twenty minute drive away, which is n't too bad, but there's nothing much there. A few kitschy shops, one grocery store, a one-screen movie theater. You worry that if you were to bring someone other than family that they wo n't appreciate it. But you do, and that's what matters. You spend the rest of the daylight reading on the screened in porch, listening to the nature around you. 

"," Write with the tech-savvy and rebellious style of a cyberpunk hacker, fighting against the system.","It's nearly 10 pm, and I'm driving down Basket Creek Road, a lonely ribbon of asphalt slicing through the fog-laden night. The absence of streetlights casts long, ominous shadows, and the fog wraps me in its chilly embrace, suffocating me with its silence. It's been a year since anyone has graced this desolate mountain home with their presence, and nature has reclaimed it, burying its former glory beneath a carpet of weeds.

As I step out of the car, the damp grass tickles my feet, and my senses are assaulted by the pungent aroma of damp earth and decaying vegetation. The thought of snakes slithering through the grass sends shivers down my spine, but I push my fears aside, eager to begin my journey.

The bridge that once pulsed with life now stands silent, its red facade faded to a somber gray. The brook below rages, its waters swelling with the force of the rain, obscuring the scars of erosion that mar the landscape. I reach the small house, my heart pounding with anticipation. I search for the key, my mind wandering back to the countless memories that unfolded within its hallowed halls.

Finally, I find it - the key, hidden amidst the clutter of my bag. With trembling hands, I insert it into the lock and turn. The door swings open, revealing a time capsule of my youth. The black and white linoleum floor, the faded photographs, the pungent odor of mice and decay - all evoke a flood of memories.

I hate this part, but it's a necessity. I venture into the basement, my footsteps echoing through the empty halls. The only sounds are the ticking of the clock, the rustle of leaves, and the occasional groan of a mouse. As I turn on the water, I feel a sense of satisfaction knowing that I have restored this ancient abode to its former glory, albeit for a fleeting moment."
"The memory came unbidden. A wretched child, unwanted in a city without orphanages. Scraping a living to survive like all the other urchins. Dashing between alleys to avoid the urban predators. Begging for alms and receiving kicks as often as kindness. Being tormented by those who were older or just larger. 
 
 The flashes of ancient emotion flooded into the mind. Fear, anger, longing, hopelessness. The child was chased out of so many places, forced away from cramped fires and meager meals. Despondent and starving the child went the only place left for the night: a cemetery. 
 
 The tombs were always cold but dry at least. Sometimes even some moldy food offerings left for the spirits by the priests. Some few other miserable and lost lost were already there. Claiming these slight refuges as well. The Child finally finds a crypt not guarded. Clawing a way through a rusted grate. 
 
 Inside was safety at last and a surprise. A fire, black as a void, burns eternally in a sconce. It offered naught but were-light, but also heat against the chill of night. This place of death gave life for the child in more ways than one. The only other occupant a brooding raven atop her nest high in a broken window. The child curled up to rest. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 An age later the mighty Lich stoods over it's domain. The cries and groans of a fallen army writhing in its death throes rose up to the delight of the carrion eaters. The flocks and murders of them followed the Lich like a fell cloud. From this phenomena the Lich was known as the Carrion Bringer. It's coming was always foreshadowed by the arrival of the Lich's pet: the Raven King. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 The child is awakened by by the chirping cries of hatchlings. Insisting on morsels from their mother. When she left one attempted to follow but his meager fledgling wings proved insufficient and he fell. The baby bird dropped right onto the child and this proved enough to disturb the torpor of awakening. 
 
 `` You fell? You ca n't go back home?'' The child asked as the chick cheeped and pecked at a finger hungrily. The child tried to return the infant but alas the nest was too high. `` I'm sorry, I ca n't get you home... I ca n't go home either... Let's find some food okay?'' The child soothed the trembling chick and tucked it into a tiny breast pocket. 
 
 Casting about there was indeed a tray of spoiled food left for the dead, pushed through a slot under the door. The child consumed it but the little raven could not eat it. knowing the dead are eaten by bugs and the birds eat bugs the child decided to push open the crypts solitary coffin. It's brittle wooden lid gave way even to the Child's meager touch. 
 
 Inside there were indeed insects to be had. Which the tiny bird ate happily. Yet as the Child sought through the moldering remains something else was found. A book strangely enough one that had n't rotted with it's owner. The Child pulled it out and admired it's black leather binding, and blue-gold script circling the bejeweled skull emblazoned on it's cover. 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 The Lich strode through the frozen city, listening to the howling winds of winter in it's deserted streets. The corpses left bloody smears in the pristine white as the undead dragged them from their homes and shops. Soon they too would join the ranks of the un-breathing horde. These streets were so familiar and yet so foreign now. 
 
 Once the Lich reached the cemetery it stopped and beheld the trove before it. It raised its spindly fingers and from withered lips an incantation went forth. The ground began to tremble and gravestones began to topple as the earth gave way beneath them. More recruits for the Lich's army clawed their way back into the daylight. 
 
 The Lich walked among them looking for one particular crypt... 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 Child became adult and adult became mage. The cruel writings of the book forced themselves into the impressionable mind. Growing in power and meaning as the Mage became more skilled. The Mage happily ignored this dark influence and enjoyed a simple life. Mending broken items and lifting simple curses was always in demand. 
 
 The fledgling too had grown into the Mage's familiar. Uplifted from a simple beast by their unbreakable bond. Speaking to each other in their own language, sharing life's little joys and pleasures. The Mage was not wealthy nor influential, not having had the money or connections to attend a school nor attract a master. No a simple lodging over a small shop was all they required. 
 
 The Mage sat on his balcony taking in an afternoon's sun with a cup of tea and a table of broken wares to repair. Chatting amiably with the Raven on his perch. The cries or a pack of children in the street below brought a painful smile to the Mage, a remembrance of a wasted youth. Then the unexpected happened. 
 
 The children were taunting a small urchin. Throwing rocks and insults alike. The Mage knew that pain and called down angrily from the balcony above for them to stop. The distraction proved enough and the victim got away. The bullies did n't take lightly to this and one unfortunate stone sailed up to the balcony... 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 The tomb doors disintegrated easily and the Lich strode inside. The long ruined coffin and darkly burning sconce still stood where once a sad urchin had once found solace. The coffin was swept aside and beneath a stone lid was revealed. Inside was something the Lich had long sought and killed to find... 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 The Mage screamed aloud in a pain deeper than any previously known. The bloodied stone sat beside the wounded raven at the base of his perch. The old bird had always been there for the Mage. Huddled together in the streets, finding food and hiding spots they had become more than partners. 
 
 The children below had died quickly when the fireball struck them. The screams and alarms of other citizens around had led to the clang of alarm bells. The Mage cared not except for the grief, and anger. Soon the guards would come to take the Mage away. To leave the beloved Raven here as it's vibrant but meager life bled away. 
 
 NO that could not come to pass... words welled up from forgotten times. A foul mist began to seep from the locked chest in the attic. The Mage tenderly scooped up the beloved familiar and carried him inside. The Mage barred his doors and threw open the chest, drawing forth the black book. There was something to be done.... 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 The Lich beheld the object of it's long quest. An item so lost to history as to become a legend. The Philosopher's stone. It had been here all this time not far from the resting place of it's creator above, whose wicked tome had guided the Lich for so long. The Raven King cawed from the rafters of the tomb. The Lich turned and saw that the creature had settled upon a long abandoned nest. 
 
 `` Yes my friend, we are finally home''
"," Adopt a Victorian Gothic style, emphasizing ornate language, emotional intensity, and possibly supernatural elements.","The memory unfolded, like a spectral tapestry woven from threads of the past. It was a memory steeped in sorrow, yet laced with the faintest glimmer of hope. The child, born unwanted, had carved a niche amidst the cold stone tombs of the cemetery.

The night had cast long, mournful shadows across the tombstones, mirroring the child's desolate existence. Fear, anger, and longing intertwined within the child's heart, like a tempest raging within a storm. The cemetery offered a sense of safety, a refuge from the tormentors who had driven the child from every other corner of the city.

In the crypt, the cold, dry air permeated the air. The only sound was the occasional sigh of the wind, and the rustle of the raven's wings. The child curled up, finding solace amidst the cold stone walls. It was a temporary respite, a moment of peace amidst the storm of life.

As the years turned into decades, the child grew, yet the memories of their harrowing childhood remained etched in their mind. The whispers of the past echoed through their thoughts, reminding them of the day they found refuge amidst the tombs. The child's journey had been marked by tragedy, but it had also been punctuated with moments of grace and resilience.

In the end, the child's story became intertwined with the legend of the Lich, a formidable force known for its insatiable appetite for destruction. The Lich's arrival was heralded by the arrival of its pet raven, the Raven King. And so, the child's journey, filled with both sorrow and triumph, was forever etched in the annals of time."
"Chad: *Unemployment is down thirty percent. Crime rates are falling to match. And the man responsible for all this is here tonight. Ladies and Gentlemen, Jeff Holden* 
 
 The presenter stood up extending one arm out to the side of the stage where the esteemed psychologist enters. Jeff and Chad Morissen, the presenter, share an handshake as the two men sit down. After exchanging the required conversation to the new guest, How was the flight?, Enjoying your stay in the city?, Chad stirs the conversation in the main direction. 
 
 Chad: *The question on everyone's minds Jeff is, how did you consider Audio Academic Therapy as a solution to this problem? * 
 
 Sitting forward in his chair, Dr.Jeff Holden placed his hands together and started to gesture as he spoke. 
 
 Jeff: *Well once the ability to awaken one from the Sleepx coma was developed, with all credit to my colleague Dr.Kuang, we as a race saw that we still faced the same problem. Only a small fraction that awake ceased complete use of the drug. The vast majority continued their appearances at the hospital. This is when I began my research on the topic. I found that by observing several users, when using the drug and when off, I could deduce several theories. The users often told me that external sources could be perceived, mainly through smell and hearing. This is why many played their favorite music in the backround or had scented candles lit. Unlike regular dreams they retained vivid detail of these dreams from start to completion. Keep that in mind. Next I had a look at the types of people who this drug affected severely, my original subjects were functional members of society who have been taking the drug for several years with no noticeable detrimental affects to their physical or psychological health. My research in the demographic of people entering the hospital in a comatose state revealed that the vast majority were repeat unemployed users with little or no family and friends. They would simply come in and out of the constant dream environment because it was, to them, a viable escape from a life where they see themselves having no prospects. * 
 
 Chad: *I see how you came about with developing the therapy, yes, that is extraordinary. But how did you bring computer science into this idea? * 
 
 Jeff: *Actually that is a funny story that I was just about to get to, I was working with a Phd student of mine, he would rather not be named and drawn into the spotlight, who gave me that idea. One day when I was giving him advice on his thesis he had his laptop open. His idea involved several dynamic psychological tests hidden in video games. He had a code open and was adjusting several things. The structure was simple, all aspects of the code in question had comments underneath explaining exactly what each piece was doing. The best part was it was all words, numbers and symbols. Things that could easily be described through audio. From there I visited a few friends in Trinity College's Computer Science department. Once they were on board I had them, using audio only, put together an entire semester of a computer science course. The finished product was two hundred and fifty hours long. With this, I hired three subjects from the original few I had observed. Over the course of several sessions they each listened to the audio. With explicit instructions to not study this material other than the audio while using the drug. The results were astounding. Each subject showed over ninety five percent knowledge retention and with simple hints during a second test that retention was a solid one hundred percent. * 
 
 The crowd clapped along with Chad. As the audience slowed their clap Chad raised his hands to urge them to cease. 
 
 Chad: *Magnificent. Please continue, it is from here that you start implementing the therapy into hospitals is it? * 
 
 Jeff: *No, no, no. That was merely one semester of the course and it was two hundred and fifty hours long. With an entire college degree worth of material we were easily pushed over two thousand hours. That is eighty three days one would need to listen to the audio while under the effect of the drug. That was not acceptable. It was something one of my original subjects had said that sparked my next experiment into the matter. After one session that lasted ten hours, he said,'' That was ten hours? It felt like a year''. This made me think, if we accelerated the audio could retention stay as high. With new subjects we conducted the time-information retention experiments. Starting at double speed and eventually working our way to as high as twenty fold. Incredibly, we were getting on average above eighty percent retention, falling exponentially, around fifteen fold speed. Hence, our subjects were getting, and retaining, a working college education in computer science in less than six days of total listening time. * 
 
 The roar of the crowd came just as Jeff finished his last sentence. Chad was clapping along with them, this time allowing them to finish at their own accord. When they calmed down, Chad continued. 
 
 Chad: *So lets recap. You find a means to educate users of this drug in computer science with, relatively to standard learning, a incredibly fast method. I can see how this reduces the amount of unemployed being admitted to hospital but what stops them from using the drug afterwards? Does this immense learning cause harm? What if the person has a bad lucid dream while this is being administered, and then is basically stuck in a a hell where for all eternity, or the length of time it feels to them, they are taught computer science? So many questions left to be answered, and hopefully they will be, after this commercial break. * 
 

"," Use the bold and brash language of a Viking warrior, full of conquest and exploration.","**Chad:** ""Ladies and Gentlemen, Jeff Holden, the man responsible for all this is here tonight. So listen up, because I've got a story to tell you that will make your blood boil!""

The presenter, Chad Morissen, stood up, extending his arm out to the side of the stage where the esteemed psychologist, Dr. Jeff Holden, enters. Jeff and Chad shake hands, and the two men sit down. After exchanging pleasantries, Chad gets straight to the point.

""Jeff, the question on everyone's minds is, how did you consider Audio Academic Therapy as a solution to this problem?"" Chad asks.

Sitting forward in his chair, Jeff puts his hands together and begins to gesture. ""Well, once the ability to awaken one from the Sleepx coma was developed, we as a race saw that we still faced the same problem,"" Jeff explains. ""Only a small fraction that awake ceased complete use of the drug. The vast majority continued their appearances at the hospital. This is when I began my research on the topic.

They would simply come to the hospital and lie down for a nap. It's a sad state of affairs, but I'm working on a solution.""

Jeff's speech is full of passion and conviction. He uses vivid imagery and strong language to paint a picture in the listener's mind. He also uses a lot of repetition and rhythm to keep the listener engaged. The speech is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear beginning, middle, and end."
"`` My dearest Cecilia, 
 
 
 I'm writing this letter to you in the half-hour I've been given to prepare in my dressing room at the horrendously-named `` Cupid's Ark''. Do you know why they named it that? Apparently, Remuald, the life-scientist who invented the life-mate matching algorithm saved humanity from a flood of unhappy alliances and in the process, automated Cupid's job profile. The ubiquitous nod to Noah's Ark thrown in for those who do n't understand subtlety. Does any one ever think of all the animals that did n't make it aboard the Ark? The ones drowned in the flood? 
 
 
 Everyone is so happy now. We've seemed to have ended the loneliness epidemic. In the fallout, we've also eliminated the richest fuel of human expression. Just look at our art now! Where is the pain? Why does our poetry lack so much? We used to be creators, now we're just happy being adjusters. We iron out the wrinkles and that's about it. We care not what caused the wrinkles or how it alters the fabric of our existence... I'm sorry Cess, I'm rambling. 
 
 
 Last night was the best night of my life. I am in love with you, I know that now. Last night was when I realized it and that is why I question Remuald's algorithm now. There are three other 18-year old men ahead of me, eagerly waiting for their life-mates. Their joy is contagious but I'm immune. It ca n't be right. This tuxedo feels burdensome. I know in the deepest of my hearts that you're the one and yet it will not be you on the other side of that door today. 
 
 
 What hurts me more is that tomorrow, it will be your turn to meet your life-mate. I ca n't believe we came so close to being born on the same date. What I ca n't come to terms with even more is why did Remuald's perfect algorithm deduce that all unquestionably compatible life-mates must be born on the same day? Perhaps, it was the machine's way of consolidating economy? I mean two birthdays and an anniversary, celebrated on the same day saves a lot of money. Is that what us humans have distilled ourselves down to? Just digits on a calculator? 
 
 
 I must leave you know, my love. It's time Remuald's equation will be put to the test. If the rumoured one in three billion chance of error exists, I hope it is now and dear god, I hope it is I. 
 
 
 I want you to know Cess, that I love you and no matter what happens, I always will and will always want happiness for you. With or without me. 
 
 
 Yours, in this life and the next, 
 
 Damian'' 
 
 
 `` Damian, it's time'' says Brendan, Damian's father with a soft touch and a warm smile accentuated by the spreading of his greying, fatherly whiskers. 
 
 
 Damian hides the letter in his coat pocket and picks up the bouquet of flowers he must give to his life-mate. He is quiet as a mouse of christmas night, yet stands up straight, a full inch over his old-man. 
 
 
 `` How do I look?'' he asks. 
 
 
 `` You look ready, son'' Brendan replies, hugging his son with a chest swollen with pride. `` More than I was in my time.'' 
 
 
 They start walking towards the Rendez-vous area. 
 
 
 `` I wish I was born in your time'' Damian says, `` I would've at least had a choice.'' 
 
 
 They reach the doorway. Brendan turns to his son: 
 
 
 `` Love chooses for us all, my dear boy. And no amount of freewill and mathematics can do a damn thing about it.'' 
 
 
 They step in to the area and announce their arrival to steward, who duly makes a note. He is asked to wait outside Door 11. There are 10 other happy couples meeting each other and enveloped in loving embrace. Some have know each other for all their lives and some, meeting for the very first time. Everyone believes in the algorithm. It has n't failed in 24 years. 
 
 
 Damian takes his position in front of Door 11. On top of it, a giant portrait of Remuald grinning from beyond the grave. 
 
 
 The door starts sliding up slowly... and... 
 
 
 It's empty. 
 
 
 Damian looks at his father. His father looks at the steward, who shrugs. 
 
 
 `` Daaamiiiiaaaaannnnn...'' a cry in the distance. It's Cecilia running... in a dress! 
 
 
 Damian starts running towards her. 
 
 
 She stops, kicks off her high heels and runs like a schoolboy away from books. 
 
 
 The crash into each other somewhere in the middle and break out of the space-time continuum. She climbs over him in only the most beautiful way an otherwise unwomanly-woman can climb over the love of her life. 
 
 
 `` I love you, Cess. You're the one'' he says as tears run free from his brave eyes. 
 
 
 `` I am the one you silly! I'm late! I was supposed to be behind the door!'' she says. 
 
 
 `` Bu... but... how? You turn 18 tomorrow!'' he asks, puzzled. 
 
 
 `` You were born in India, Damian. India's a day ahead of us'' 
 
 
 The changed in barometric pressure caused by Damian and Cecilia's extraordinary, and near-football tackle embrace resulted in a flux in the air. This aforementioned flux, combined with the poor quality of Acrylic paint used on Remuald's portrait caused it to shrink ever so slightly in the general area around his smile-lines, in effect causing an expansion in his grin.

Perhaps, it was the machine's way of consolidating economy? I mean two birthdays and an anniversary, celebrated on the same day saves a lot of money. Is that what drove Remuald's hand?"

 It's funny how things work. We knew that *survival of the fittest* was the rule of nature, and that *necessity was the mother of invention* had created every technology up to the point when we no longer needed but merely wanted. 
 
 Global Warming... Climate Change... call it what you like, but nobody can deny now that it was where those two old sayings came together. You ever wonder where Zika came from? Yeah, that was just the beginning. 
 
 It started geting weird with mosses beginning to pop up in weird places in urban China, causing the CO2 and other pollutant levels to drop but the mosses to become toxic to consume ( they also made a handy substitute for Tobacco in cigarettes ). Then the fish stocks started unexpectedly increasing as fish began growing scales which cut through steel nets. 
 
 In North America, honeybees started increasing in population again, resulting in flowers blooming from cracks in the planks of wooden houses, and a suspicious drop in the number of wasps and hornets was revealed to be caused by a chemical emitted by the flowers which was toxic to the predatory insects. 
 
 In South America, trees began to grow in the middle of fields in a matter of weeks, forcing constant logging to fight back against an overcompensating rainforest. 
 
 Rangers in Africa were the first to notice that Ivory confiscated from poachers was starting to rot, making it worthless without an Elephant or Rhino to support it. New species were discovered in increasing numbers by gold miners in jungles, including everything from viruses and prions to previously unseen subspecies of large wildcats. 
 
 Europe was unexpectedly hit by a plague of mice, who had somehow figured out how to swarm and mad-dash for cooked food and ingredients in order to confuse humans and provide safety in numbers. Trees grew thicker, tougher trunks as they sprouted from cracks in streets and crept in from the pockets of vegetation in cities. 
 
 In Australia, the rabbit population finally started to decline as plants began producing a toxin specifically tailored to the rodent's cellular structure. A wave of patients entered hospitals as attacks by venomous animals became more common. The problem became so bad that an evacuation of the rural areas was made in a manner not seen since the refugee crisis of the 2010s, and with a strong resemblance to the evacuations of cities in Britain during WWII. 
 
 Asia remained relatively untouched, likely due to the isolated nature of the various sections of the continent. Still, to this day the bamboo continues to creep up the sides of the Himalayas and into the Mongolian steppes. 
 
 Antarctica started to get weird last. Melting ice caps, while not severe enough to substantially raise sea levels, caused pockets of isolated microbes to release ancient viruses and bacteria onto the landscape, which surprised scientists when they started showing signs of clumping into multi-cellular arrangements adapted to the extreme cold. 
 
 We thought it could n't get any stranger when our pets and livestock began to skew away from their bred traits and towards traits suited to where they were living... 
 
 Just last week, the first human born with a strange `` birth defect'' was analysed by doctors. They found she had a spine which was perfectly suited to bipedal locomotion, ending the 2 million year reign of the flawed human backbones which were vestiges of our quadrapedal ancestors.

"," Present the essay in the style of existentialist philosophy, questioning the nature of existence, freedom, and choice.","The tapestry of existence unfolds in a dance of freedom and choice, yet amidst the intricate interplay of forces beyond our comprehension, we find ourselves grappling with the enigmatic and unsettling question of our being. In this existentialist tapestry, the threads of freedom and choice intertwine with the unsettling realization of our finitude, leaving us with a profound sense of responsibility towards ourselves and the world.

As we navigate the labyrinth of the contemporary era, the spectre of climate change casts a long shadow, reminding us of the interconnectedness of all things. It is as if the very fabric of nature itself is unraveling, revealing the intricate dance between necessity and invention. The inexplicable emergence of mosses, the proliferation of fish with razor-sharp scales, and the inexplicable growth of trees in the middle of fields, serve as sobering reminders of the unpredictable nature of our planet.

In this capricious dance of existence, the human experience intertwines with the natural world in a profound way. As we confront the challenges presented by a changing climate, we are also confronted with the existential question of our purpose and meaning. The decline of honeybees, the resurgence of the rabbit population, and the plague of mice serve as poignant reminders of the interconnectedness of our fates.

Through the lens of existentialism, we find solace in recognizing the inherent freedom and responsibility that accompanies our existence. We are free to create meaning and purpose, yet burdened by the knowledge that our choices are finite and that we ultimately face the abyss of oblivion. It is in this paradox that lies the essence of existentialism—the recognition of our freedom to choose, while acknowledging the limitations of our choices.

As we journey through the labyrinth of life, we are compelled to confront the unsettling question of our finitude. We grapple with the realization that our time is precious and fleeting, and that the choices we make today will have lasting implications for ourselves and generations to come. It is in this existential dance that we discover the strength to embrace our freedom and responsibility, and to create a world that is not merely a reflection of our suffering, but a testament to our resilience, creativity, and compassion."
"I wrung my tired hands as I watched the clock tick forward. I was due to give my speech at 3 PM, Eastern Standard Time. Right now, it was 2:47 PM. As I sat here at my desk, I thought back to the past few weeks, where one after the other, delegates and leaders and representatives of the United Nations shook my hand and wished me luck. Each word was worthless. I saw the helplessness in their eyes and they must have seen it in mine. 
 
 The Greater American president was the last people I waved out of the door. Before he left, he pulled me in for a tight hug. I could feel the weight of the world pass off of his shoulders and onto mine. While he never had control over more than half of a continent, I think I could relate to him more than anyone else. I was soon to inherit the entire world. I waited for a moment in his arms, and he in mine. I suppose we both expected some exchange of words. There were none. 
 
 The date is October the 11th, 2067. The time is now 2:56 PM. The United Nations officially declared that I was the world leader in the face of an impending apocalypse. All military power, all governing bodies, even the economy must answer to me now. On my agenda, for now, was one thing: address the remaining population of Earth. At 3 PM, I go live to the masses. Laid before me is a rough script full of talking points I can barely bring myself to face. My arms are shaking. I take some Xanax. My prescription has been getting heavier lately, and it shows in my face, my walk, and in my voice. I do n't think I even care anymore. 
 
 The sparse camera crew set in the office jolts me from my trance. `` Paul,'' says the man running the broadcast, `` fifteen seconds and you're live.'' I sighed, and sat up straight. I wiped the sweat off my brow as he count down from five. `` Five. Four. Three.'' He motioned now with his hands, two, one, point. The planet Earth, as well as the various refugee ships able to pick up the signal, is now at his attention. 
 
 `` People of Earth, I greet you and thank you for tuning in. My name is Paul Abrams, and I have been delegated by the United Nations to lead you for the months to come. As many of you know, an asteroid impact due to arrive in seven month's time has the potential to cause an impact winter, blocking the sun from lighting and heating the earth for many years. We have sent off billions of humans to our galactic colonies, and unfortunately not all of us could make the trip.'' I allowed a break not for the audience, but for myself. My family did not make it onto any ship. My wife, my children, even my parents were probably huddled somewhere in a New York slum, listening to my broadcast. No one could find it possible to take them to a colony, not even the UN officials that worked so closely with me, not even after I was elected leader of over a hundred million damned souls could my loved ones make it off. 
 
 `` As a result, there will be a great change in how the laws and doctrines of the world work. The United Nations have worked together in the time we had to devise a plan for those of us left to brave it out.'' I cleared my throat, and looked down at the list in front of me. `` We have began building, in suitable areas, large underground shelters able to fit ten thousand people, along with enough rations to feed them for up to a year. In addition, each shelter will be fitted with its own garden that can provide for our nutritional requirements should the need arise.'' Thank god for the hydroponics boom. `` A list of shelters can and will be made available to you by your regional governments in the passing weeks. All shelters will close two weeks before the scheduled arrival of the asteroid.'' 
 
 A lump rose in my throat as I went on. `` Military personnel will be dispersed to major population areas ('Were there even any left?' I thought to myself ) to insure the stability of the area and the long-term survival of your regional government. Keeping order will be very important, and disruption of the order will result in a very strict crackdown on any movements seeking to work against the greater good. Patrols will be sent out into more rural areas on a weekly basis to ensure that all are safe and in compliance with mandatory protocol.'' Another pause. 
 
 `` In the coming weeks, local hospitals will offer euthanization services for those who seek them.'' I let out a shaky breath. `` Regional governments, if they choose to, may also seek the euthanization of people deemed unable to fully contribute to society during the impact winter.'' I shuddered in disgust, but I knew the intentions were objectively good. The mentally ill and physically handicapped had no place in the shelters. Who would care for them? What could they be if not another mouth to feed? I hoped, at the very least, each one would get their own marked grave. 
 
 `` We must unite as a world to get through this event. We can not spread terror. We can not war each other to death. Working together is the only way for the human race to survive on this planet. I sincerely hope that we persevere as a people, and can do the best we can. May God bless you, and thank you.'' The camera's red light faded out. I could n't help but explode into tears. *This is it, * I thought. *You're the ringleader for the greatest circus in the universe. *

"A hush fell over the croud as president Barack Obama took the stage. Everyone looked, expectantly, waiting for the eloquently prepared speech the president surely was about to deliver. 
 
 He cleared his throat and spoke. 
 
 `` Hello, fellow american.'' 
 
 Well that was odd. The first three words and he had already made a mistake. Everyone kept watching. 
 
 `` This, you should vote me. I leave power. Good. Thank you, Thank you.'' 
 
 Okay, something was definitely wrong here. Was he having a stroke? The Black-suited men on either side of him began to get suspicious. They were eyeing the croud like 2 equally ravenous hawks looking for their next meal. 
 
 `` If you vote me, I'm hot. Taxes, they'll be lower... son.'' 
 
 The Black-suits beside him were now visibly unnerved. Maybe he was trying to convey to them that he was in danger without causing suspicion? The crowd was going restless, and there was a palpable tension all throughout the room. 
 
 As more and more suits began to fill the stage, the president uttered one last sentence. 
 
 `` The democratic vote is the right thing to do, America, so do.'' 
 
 And with that the suits swept him off the stage, trying to get him away from whatever unforseen danger was causing him to act to strangely. 
 
 As the lights go out and the croud begins to murmur, one final word is heard from offstage that sends the croud back into silence.

"," Emulate Morrison's lyrical prose, exploring themes of identity, race, and humanity with depth and nuance.","A hush descended upon the crowd as President Barack Obama graced the stage, his presence heralded by a collective sigh. The air crackled with anticipation, as the audience collectively held their breath, their collective gaze locked upon the man poised to deliver an eloquent speech.

With a clearing of his throat, Obama began his address, his voice resonating through the hall. His opening words, ""Hello, fellow American,"" were met with a wave of expectation, each listener anticipating the eloquent speech they had come to hear. However, as the words flowed through his mouth, an unsettling feeling crept into the air.

The president's tone was off, his words jumbled, and his demeanor strangely subdued. The Black-suited men flanking him seemed to be on edge, their eyes scanning the crowd with suspicion. It was as if an invisible force was pushing him to say something, anything, that would cause a stir, a reaction.

As the crowd began to murmur and stir, Obama uttered his final sentence, ""The democratic vote is the right thing to do, America, so do."" With that, the suits swept him off the stage, the crowd erupting into a wave of disappointment and uncertainty.

As the lights dimmed and the crowd dispersed, a single word echoed through the hall, sending the remaining audience back into silence.

 There is something beautiful about watching a grown man weep. 
 
 Tears, you see, are one of the most beautiful things that God ever blessed us with. To many, they are only water and salt, but they tell all kinds of fascinating stories: years of memories; honest words that left an impact; cruel belts that also left an impact; a single rush of frustration, of helplessness, of soul-crushing despair. 
 
 People will talk about happy tears. They will say that they cry out of joy, or because something is beautiful, or because it has profoundly affected their soul forever. 
 
 These people are lying. There are no happy tears. When people claim they are tears of joy, because something else is beautiful, they do not tell the truth. They are tears of envy, because they know they will never have something as beautiful. 
 
 I have made over 25 grown men weep in the last two weeks. I find it very gratifying, to make them understand that they are awful, terrible people who can not be helped, while at that same time listening to them tell me how I have been such a big help. 
 
 I do n't do much, really. I simply sit in the chair, like some sort of doctor, and poke and prod and pinch until they tell me where it hurts. Then I poke and prod even more until they scream and weep for mercy from their own sins. 
 
 You see, I pretend to help these people. They come to my office, and I let them reveal themselves to me, get them to tell me their secrets, their fears, their deepest insecurities. 
 
 And then I exploit them. I break them down, and they do not even realize it is happening. 
 
 I love my job. People say that sick people see psychologists, and even sicker people become them. Maybe they are right, who knows? 
 
 I realize that you must think I am a terrible person for this, but I assure you that I am not. I am only helping to contribute more beauty to the world. 
 
 Water and salt. And beauty. That is what I bring to the world. 
 
 I hope you can say that you've done something as important.
"," Transform the essay into a high fantasy narrative, complete with elaborate world-building, magic systems, and epic quests.","In the realm of Eldric, where ethereal winds carried whispers of ancient lore, there lived a master of empathy named Aric. Known for his unparalleled ability to elicit tears from even the most stoic of hearts, Aric possessed a gift that rivaled the most potent of magic. With his piercing gaze and a heart filled with compassion, he journeyed through the land, transforming lives and etching tales of sorrow into the annals of history.

One fateful day, as Aric traveled through the serpentine caves of Grimblestone Keep, he encountered a wounded knight named Gareth. With compassion, Aric rushed to Gareth's side, tending to his wounds and offering solace in the face of adversity. As they journeyed back to the safety of Aric's humble abode, a profound connection forged between them.

Aric's mastery of empathy extended beyond mere words. Through a potent blend of ancient magic and unwavering determination, he unlocked the hidden power of tears, wielding them as a weapon to bring about profound change. With a single touch, he could evoke tears of sorrow, joy, and even gratitude.

One day, as Aric traveled through the treacherous forest of Thornkeep, he encountered a group of bandits. With swiftness and cunning, he devised a plan to outsmart and outgun the thugs, liberating the innocent victims. The tears that flowed from the eyes of those freed from their chains were a testament to Aric's unwavering compassion.

Aric's legacy lived on long after his passing, inspiring generations of empaths to follow in his footsteps. Through his tears, he not only brought solace to the afflicted but also ignited a spark of understanding and empathy within the hearts of all who crossed his path.

And so, the tale of Aric, the master of empathy, continues to be woven into the tapestry of Eldric, serving as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, the power of compassion can prevail."
"The master stood in a black robe, dark winds blowing through the street. Dark mana was giving their hands an ethereal quality. They knew who it was. The master of the dark keep, the ruler of the land. As she walked through the streets the air became cool, itchy. Her reputation proceeded her through dozens of cities, and they all knew what terrors would come forth from her hands. 
 
 Everyone smiled. The fervor rose throughout the whole city as they all began to feel the itchy tingle of the dark, the manipulative energy surrounding the master. Everyone cheered. 
 
 For beyond the edge of the city, upon a hill, was their opponent. Though it was noon, behind their enemy was a light as bright as the sun. From his footsteps rose flowers and the grass of life. The mana that grew a halo around him, an aura of every color of the rainbow, shined upon his elvish features. This was the usurper. 
 
 And city after city fell before him. Armies fell. Wizards fell. The city of Almorath was now a flooded fortress inhabited by sentient trees and rotting corpses. The city of Korin-Awar was the burial ground of vines, choking the life out of farmers. The beautiful crystal city of Yuli was crushed, the sparkles now covered by the petals of roses and lillies. These cities were all manned by powerful wizards. The battles were long, but very few survived such an onslought. The usurper, the conquerer, the beautiful elf killed not hundreds, but thousands. Thousands upon thousands. His life magic left no prisoners, and it left nothing ever created by the hands of a rival. 
 
 The majority of the survivors left for the necromancers keep. She was a prodigy, creating ghosts and shades when she was barely an apprentice. She was young, stout, short. When she was barely 20, the master ritual of dark masters was done in the public square - where she sucked the lifeforce from her master, absorbing the previous masters connection the the dark realm. She, alone, would be their savior. 
 
 And they cheered. And they hoped. And in the quiet, in the dark, in the scared buildings on the edge of the city they prepared to leave. For the beautiful one, who brought rainbows and death wherever he walked, came forth. None, they thought, could stop the monster. Not even their hero.

"," Use the savvy and sharp language of a street-smart urbanite, with slang and a quick wit.","The slick black robed master, dark winds whipping through the street, exuded dark mana like it was an ethereal second skin. It was her reputation that preceded her, a terror forged in the fires of countless cities. The air crackled with the tingle of the dark as she strutted through the streets, a predator sensing her prey.

The city pulsed with the fervor of her presence. Every smile held a hint of awe and anticipation. It was as if the dark itself danced with her, its tendrils wrapping around every living being. The city erupted in cheers, their voices echoing through the streets.

But beyond the city, upon a hill, stood her opponent. A beacon of light amidst the noon sun, his footsteps spawned flowers and the scent of life. He was the usurper, the conqueror, the master of light and life. With a mana as vibrant as the rainbow, he painted the sky. His elvish features bore the wisdom of ages, and his heart was filled with the desire to protect.

With each city that fell, the usurper's legend grew. He battled wizards and armies, leaving behind a trail of blood and devastation. The city of Almorath, once a vibrant metropolis, now stood as a flooded fortress, its monuments swallowed by the roots of trees. Korin-Awar was a tomb of vines, choking the life out of its inhabitants. Yuli, a crystal city bathed in the splendor of roses and lilies, was now a ruin, its sparkle covered by the petals of decay. These cities were testaments to the power and ruthlessness of the usurper.

But amidst the chaos, there was a glimmer of hope. The master's greed had driven her to absorb the lifeforce of her master, leaving her vulnerable and alone. It was the young necromancer, a prodigy in her own right, who saw the opportunity to strike. With cunning precision, she manipulated the dark, creating ghosts and shades to fight alongside her.

And so, the master met her demise at the hands of the young, spirited warrior. The dark was banished, and the city breathed a sigh of relief. It was a victory born out of tragedy, a testament to the enduring spirit of those who stood against the forces of darkness."
"It was a dull tuesday morning when I woke up to the sounds of my phone going off non-stop. Aaron was frantically screaming nonsense at me. `` THERE IS A NUMBER... Errr... SOMETHING IS ON ME JOSH!'' I mumbled and turned on my side to go back to my dreams, but that is when I saw it. There in the mirror, it was right on top of me. A shiny green **1**. I thought I was seeing things, I **had** to still be dreaming! I reached up and tried to touch it, but nothing was there to feel. My shaking hand pierced through the number and it stayed exactly where it was. 
 I showered to clear my head and let the brisk water wash away the thoughts of this mysterious symbol above my dome. What did it mean anyways? Then it happened. A loud crack and mumble that seemed to fill the air. The water stopped. All I could do is stand there, naked and sopping wet. I just wished it would all go away! Why me? And what about Aaron too? I sprinted through my apartment to reach my phone. I dialed as fast as I could, but the lines were dead now. What was happening!? I have to go find him. 
 Everything outside is hectic! Everybody is running around with no idea what to do. *8,724 500 153,475 28* I tried to see the pattern but there was nothing. I hopped on my bike to find Aaron, but not before seeing it. **The red number**. I tried to clear it from my head but it was all I could think about. **Number 1,356,752**. I only got a glimpse, but the second I saw him, I knew something was off. I got to Aaron's, and to my excitement, he was completely alright. **Number 64,814**. He would n't stop staring at my **1**, but he knew nothing more than I did. A helicopter flew by with loud speakers screaming to `` GET TO THE STADIUM: AVOID THE RED AT ALL COSTS.'' *Avoid the red* It buzzed through my head a million times. We packed up some clothes and headed to the stadium with no idea what to do. 
 29 days passed by as the green numbers got lower. I was in charge, I was number 1. The red seemed to tear a person apart, that is, if you count them as a person anymore. Every second, **1,000** people went red. It was sad watching those who had numbers in the millions go, counting down to those of us on the low end. By my calculations, I had about 81 days from the day I was chosen, until I went red. Aaron was still with me, but his time was on its way. The clock was ticking. 
 7 days remain. We are thinking about zoning people off, but I just ca n't leave him. Our day is coming and my best friend is only going to change a minute before me. Our quarantine zone is falling to pieces with the reds pounding the walls to get in. The top 10 have been meeting to eradicate the problem, but these are our friends! 3 and 8 were in a heated debate about whether to start killing them off or not. `` WHO CARES 8! They are red and they are staying that way! You remember the zoning mishap for the 39,506,000's do n't you?'' `` How could anyone forget, they had n't turned yet bu-'' `` THE REDS TORE THEM TO SHREDS! These are savages out there.'' `` We do n't know if there is an end to this or no-'' `` There is an end.'' I interjected. The entire room silenced. `` We ARE the end. We all have known this since the day we saw the countdown.'' It was then when 2 stepped in. Her voice filled the room sounding like an angel, speaking the words of the devil. `` We are dying. The walls are crumbling. What is left for us to do? What happens when we kill them off?'' 6 could barely sit still he was shaking so much. I looked around the room, 9 unfamiliar faces who had become my family. I cared about them, but how much longer could that last. `` Our friends are out there. Our families too! Who cares if we live another 7 days. We have to put them to rest. That is the risk that I am willing to take, but if you are n't, sit pretty under your little number. It is time to take our Earth back, no matter the cost.'' Everything froze. 
 10 was the only one moving. He gave me a little slow clap and a *bravo*. He began to circle the table in his luxurious pinstripe suit, but everybody else was stuck in place. He reached 9 and with a little flick, turned her number **red**. `` You could n't have possibly thought you were the real *number 1* could you?'' I tried to utter out a cry, but I was paralyzed. Who is he? He went down the line and stopped at each person. `` 8, what a waste of power!'' **RED** `` 7, he barely speaks'' **RED** `` 6, well I actually quite liked him, but nevertheless'' **RED** `` 5 may be beautiful, but her brain is definitely not helping anybody out here'' **RED** I was furious, straining to move, but nothing. `` Do n't struggle honey, It wo n't get you anywhere.'' He kept his charade up. `` 4, She and I were actually seeing eachother... hmph, oh well!'' **RED** That is when he stopped at 3. He popped his hands on 3's shoulders and sighed. `` 3 is the ONLY one who was willing to do anything savage, get his hands dirty. Sure you gave a good speech, but what were you really going to do? Gather an army and sneak off with 2 right before the fight? Exactly.'' **RED** He walked by 2 and without even a mention, smacked her number to join the rest of the crimson room. He sat right in front of me and just let me simmer in the murder of my friends. `` Now I know what you are wondering, just who am I? Well they call me *Red* as it may be. You are not the first planet I have done this too and you will not be the last. The best part about all of this? Watching you be ripped limb-from-limb by your friends and your girlfriend. Oh but I almost forgot!'' He snapped his grimy fingers and the door popped open to a dark hallway. He released us all from our sitting prison. The last thing I saw was a piercing red 64,814 beaming through the hallway.
"," Rewrite the text as an ancient myth, including gods, heroes, and mythical creatures, with a moral or explanation of natural phenomena.","In the ancient times, when the sun shone upon the land with warmth and prosperity, there lived a courageous hero named Joshua. One fateful day, as he awoke to the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves, a mysterious symbol appeared before his eyes. It was a radiant green number, shimmering like the glow of the moon on a clear night sky. The number danced and pulsed, captivating Joshua's imagination and filling him with a sense of dread.

A storm brewed on that fateful day. The wind howled, and the sky thundered. The number intensified, its power spreading through the land. It was as if the forces of nature themselves were echoing the power of the mysterious symbol.

But fear not, my dear reader. For in this tale, there is a moral to be learned. The number, though terrifying, ultimately serves to teach us about the interconnectedness of all things. Just as the number appeared to Joshua, it can also appear to us all in various forms, guiding us through life's journey.

So, remember this ancient myth and its valuable lesson. When you find yourself faced with challenges and uncertainties, remember the power of the number one and its ability to guide you through the darkest of times."
"My uncle, on my mom ’ s side, was a quiet, energetic man. I first met him when I was around the age of seventeen. He had a lab coat on, with the name Derek embroidered on it, and was very fidgety. Not able to stay still for long. Like he needed to do something, or be somewhere. However, he stopped when he noticed that I had a science article open on my lap. 
 
 “ You enjoy science, Ben? ” He asked me. 
 
 I responded, “ I love it. I plan on majoring in it. I haven ’ t picked a science yet, but I know I want to work in science. ” 
 
 He smiled at me. “ Keep it up. I might have some work for you in the future. ” 
 
 I chuckled, thinking he was joking. But his serious expression, said otherwise. It made me question what he meant by that. He left before I was able to ask about what he meant by that. I knew I needed to learn more about Derek. My entire family didn ’ t know much about him, which made me sad on their lack of interest in him. 
 
 “ Maybe if he was more interested in us, we would be more interested in him. ” My mother would say. 
 
 Although in my opinion, he was interested, just bad at showing it. I was able to find out, from my mom, that he and his wife have cancer. The only other piece of information that I could get was from my aunt on my mom ’ s side. She told me was that he is into a very cold science. 
 “ What does that mean? ” I asked. 
 “ That ’ s what he told me. I asked him why his house is always so cold and he said his science is very cold. ” 
 This intrigued me, as well as left me on my own. I began to look into sciences that had to do with extremely low temperatures. I looked through many articles. From Low-Temperature Geochemistry to the low-temperature phenomena. After two years of looking, I found cryogenics, the production and behavior of materials at low temperatures. It made me think. Would he want to attempt to live longer by freezing himself and waiting for a cure for cancer? It made me question if he wanted to be immortal. Then, the phone rang. He had died in the hospital after passing out this morning. We attended the funeral and opened his will the day prior. We were absolutely astonished at the one line in the center of his will. 
 
 Have Ben come to my house after reading this. 
 
 “ This is it? Have Ben come to take my crap? The nineteen year old? Really? He hasn ’ t even started college! ” My aunt said. 
 
 I shook my head. “ Wouldn ’ t the will be with his wife since she is the closest family member? ” 
 
 I looked at the lawyer who gave us the will. “ He told me that it need to get to you. ” 
 
 I drove straight to his house afterwards. I needed answers. His house is in a remote area in the forest, west of where I live. It ’ s around a two hour drive. I found a key was taped to the door. I used it to get inside. The freezing air was the first thing to hit me after opening the door. I went to retrieve a coat from my car. I began to explore the house. It ’ s a modern house that really sticks out in this forest. I looked around all of the main floor and found nothing but a big metal door with a number pad next to it. I pressed my fingers against the door and it was freezing. This must be the lab. If I knew the code I could explore it and get some answers. I continued to explore the house by heading upstairs. I arrived to find a woman in a hospital bed down the hall. Her room was the only room with the door open. As I began to walk toward her, she turned her head and looked at me. 
 
 “ You must be Ben. ” She said weakly, holding out an envelope. I took it, ripped it open, and begin reading the letter inside. 
 
 By the time you read this, I ’ ll be six feet under. My wife, Ann, has pancreatic cancer. I knew the day I met you, you were the one to help me. To take place in my footsteps. I have studies cryogenics for years and have come closer than ever to accomplishing what other could not. Freeze myself to be revived and cured of my cancer in the future. However; I wasn ’ t fast enough to save myself or Ann. So, I have some work for you; finish my research and save Ann, before it ’ s too late. 
 1-9-9-4 is the code. 
 
 I looked up from the paper and looked at Ann. Her body connected to machinery by tubes and wiring, keeping her alive. There are photos around her bed of Derek and her. They looked so cheerful. So alive. I couldn ’ t waste a second. I went down stairs and went back to the door with the number pad next to it. I entered the code in and the door opened. On the other side of the door was a stair case the led to the lab. On a hook next to the stairs is a lab coat with ‘ Ben ’ embroidered on it. I picked it up, put it on, and began my research. 

"," Infuse the essay with the lyrical and profound voice of Maya Angelou, reflecting on human dignity and resilience.","My Uncle Derek, a man of boundless energy and profound dignity, etched an indelible mark on my heart the day I met him. His lab coat, adorned with the name ""Derek,"" a testament to his passion for science, mirrored the fiery spirit that burned within his soul. Like a river rushing toward the sea, he could not contain his restlessness, his fidgety nature a reflection of his boundless energy.

As I flipped through a science article, he paused, his eyes meeting mine. With a smile that illuminated the room, he asked, ""You enjoy science, Ben?."" I responded with a passion that belied my youth, ""I love it. I plan on majoring in it. I haven't picked a science yet, but I know I want to work in science."" His eyes sparkled with pride, and I felt the weight of his unwavering support.

He left before I could decipher the meaning of his words, leaving me with a sense of longing and uncertainty. I knew I had to learn more about him, a man shrouded in mystery. From my mother, I learned that he and his wife battled cancer, a truth that filled me with empathy and compassion. From my aunt, I discovered his fascination with a very cold science, a fact that sparked my imagination and led me to explore the enigmatic realm of cryogenics.

As I delved into the intricacies of low-temperature physics, I couldn't help but wonder if he would choose to prolong his life through cryogenic preservation. The question raced through my mind, echoing the profound wisdom of Maya Angelou, ""Human beings are capable of enduring much more than we ever imagine."" I imagined him freezing himself, waiting for a cure, a testament to his resilience and unwavering determination to overcome adversity.

Yet, I also questioned whether he would want to be immortal. To be frozen in a state of limbo, devoid of the joys and experiences that life offers, seemed like a cruel fate. As I grappled with these complex emotions, I realized that my uncle's journey was not solely about his battle with cancer but also about the pursuit of human dignity and the boundless potential for resilience."
"All of this should be such a joy, a wondrous time where people all around the world are brimming with love and excitement over what they might have been brought. But it ’ s not, I ’ m worried, I ’ m borderline panicked. Every single year, I ’ ve felt my anxiety grow as the temperature drops, all because of one question nagging me between the ears. Am I on the naughty list this year? And there ’ s no answer, there ’ s never an answer because we weren ’ t given a guideline, there ’ s no clear line drawn in the sand that we must not cross lest we end up on the naughty list. So we ’ re left to our own devices, trying to live our lives as best we can, but people slip, they always slip. There ’ s not a soul who doesn ’ t know someone who made it onto the naughty list, I ’ ve been to the funeral of three of them alone. I ’ ve hugged my crying brother-in-law after the small explosive took my sister ’ s life. And what ’ d she do? I don ’ t know, neither does he, all we can be certain of is that she made it onto the naughty list. And she was among some of the more fortunate. 
 
 Part of me is glad she got off that easy, we ’ ve all heard the classic tales, people appearing on the local news every Christmas day telling the harrowing tale how a gift mutilated them and showed them the error of their ways. But that ’ s all bullshit, you can see it in their eyes, it ’ s fear motivating them to tell their tales. There ’ s nothing they wouldn ’ t give to have back their hands, their eyes, their legs, they ’ d all happily be the same scumbags they were before their gift was dropped off. 
 
 Yet that doesn ’ t change anything, millions of people die every year because of this crap, and we ’ re supposed to rejoice? Spread holiday cheer around, and wish our neighbors a very merry Christmas even knowing that there ’ s a chance that their son or daughter was maybe a bit too mouthy in school this year, and will be added to the ever-so-mournful Christmas obituaries. You ’ d think the death toll would ’ ve gone down after the first few years, but it ’ s still growing. Every. Single. Year. There has been more, and the answer to the question which all news stations ask when the death toll gets released is; we ’ re inherently assholes. You, me, your grandparents, all of us. None of us are perfect, it is impossible for us to be. But we used to embrace this aspect! We used to consider our imperfections to be what made us beautiful! Now? We dot our I ’ s and cross our T ’ s, we don ’ t say a mean thing about anybody ever, even when they deserve, we never curse, we always look both ways before crossing the street. People used to think it was our government that would turn us this way, sterilize our culture, make us all become non-thinking robots, afraid to act outside the norm. But no, it was him. 
 
 
 I don ’ t have a question to ask this year. I knew the answer sometime late in July. There was never a doubt in my mind that I was going to be on the naughty list, I ’ d sealed my fate. It was a normal get together, few couples around a friend ’ s place for a dinner night. We all laughed at each other ’ s jokes, we all complimented the way each other looked, stories that would be appropriate for a choir boy were told. It was good, sterile fun. But George, as ever, pushed his luck. This motherfucker for years, has been fondling my wife. Nothing overt, just a brush of the elbow against her tits as he brought her a new drink, or a trailing hand that slaps her on the ass. I have no idea how this prick had never made it onto the naughty list, even if it had happened in the old times people would ’ ve said it was egregious. But I never did anything, I never stood up for her, I never consoled her about it when we got home, and it remained unacknowledged, because we both hoped eventually he ’ d get put on that list. I saw the look on my wife ’ s face, that helpless despair that makes her skin pallid, all because she knows she can ’ t tell this creep to get bent. So, I hit him. Square in the jaw, he crumpled like an aluminum can, and we left. 
 
 Claire, my wife, did nothing but cry on the way home. She knew what I ’ d done to myself. But when she resigned herself to my fate, she thanked me. Part of me hates her for that, cause there ’ s a small chance just that tiny acknowledgement gets her put on the list right next to me. 
 
 I ’ ve had five months to reflect on my actions, to really think if that one punch was worth my death. The answer was easy to figure out – no. I ’ m not that stupid. But in my half a year, I ’ ve found freedom. I can have a drink after work if I like, I can fuck my wife, I can say fuck! I can throw on an old R rated movie and watch Arnold Schwarzenegger blow some shit sky high. I ’ m not saying I ’ ve been around the world on a pleasure cruise, living like a playboy for my final year. But I have lived, for the first time in seven years, I ’ ve lived. 
 
 Undoubtedly, when this is found, I ’ ll be dead, destroyed by some trap present that was left at the foot of my bed. So, Claire, my love, I want you to release this, post it online, send it to the news outlets, do whatever you want. Just make sure it gets out. People have to know that what they ’ re doing ain ’ t living. They ’ re machines, just going from day to day with no hope of anything new or exciting ever happening, but being forced to deal with the same heart break year after year. I know it ’ s scary to say fuck it, and know that your life is coming to an end, but hey, I only had five months, you ’ ll have twelve! I can ’ t tell you all how much fun I ’ ve had, how free I feel now. Don ’ t be enslaved by the jolly prick any longer. Just stand up on the 26th and say what I ’ ve been screaming north for five months with some pride. 
 
 Fuck you, Santa,

I’ve been to the funeral of three of my dear ones who succumbed to the unforgiving hand of the naughty list. I’ve embraced my crying brother-in-law after the tragedy that took my sister’s life. And what saddens me most is knowing that she, like countless others, was added to the annals of the naughty list. It’s a sobering thought to ponder the fleeting nature of life and the profound impact it has on those we love.

Yet, I find solace in knowing that her spirit will forever be etched in the hearts of those who knew her. Her memory will serve as a reminder to us all of the importance of kindness, compassion, and understanding. Her life was a testament to the transformative power of love, and it is a legacy that we can all emulate.

So, let’s embrace the spirit of the season, spread holiday cheer, and wish our neighbors a very merry Christmas. Let us remember that, while tragedy may befall us all, it is through our collective efforts that we can create a more compassionate and loving world."
"Today, I met the first new person. 
 
 Let me explain. Hi, my name is Sam. This is not the name that was given to me, but rather the name that I gave myself when I realized what I was. It took me a while, too, to realize that I was different. As long as I can remember, everything around me has been very much the same. It took a while, but I noticed that everybody around me runs the same routine. Not everybody is on the same clock, but eventually everything loops around. 
 
 I noticed it about a week ago, first with Brandon. Brandon has been my best friend. Now that I'm thinking about it, I do n't know why he is. But he is. I see him every day, and we talk every day. 3 days ago, he repeated himself. It took me a while to notice, to roll back in my brain whether we had actually had the same exact conversation before. It did n't take long for me to start noticing that other people around were having the same conversation, at various points throughout the week. 
 
 That brings us today. Today, I met somebody new for the first time. 
 
 He came into town, and just started talking to everybody. Literally. He made the rounds around the place, saying something to everybody. Sometimes the conversations were short. But other times, he would actually take out a notebook to write down important parts that the people were saying and mark points on a map. He was a truly fascinating person. 
 
 He came up to me, but I was too scared to say much of anything to him. I was content just watching him do his work. It was very obvious that he was not following a routine like the others. I even witnessed him repeatedly jumping on things to see if he could get onto higher places. Weird guy. 
 
 Well, now I know there are two of us? Are there more? I'll keep investigating. If there are two, there must be three, right?
"," Use the inventive and curious tone of a Victorian era inventor, fascinated by progress and technology.","My dear reader, allow me to share with you a tale of mystery and invention. It is a story woven with the threads of observation, curiosity, and the profound realization of our shared humanity.

Today, I encountered an anomaly, a singular soul who shattered the monotonous rhythm that had long been my constant companion. From the time I could first recall, the world had presented itself in a harmonious dance of familiar sights, sounds, and routines. As I surveyed my surroundings, I noticed that each individual carried their own unique rhythm, their own clockwork symphony. Yet, beneath the surface of our diverse schedules, there was a unifying thread that bound us all together.

It was on a fateful day, a week ago, that I stumbled upon the first glimmer of this mystery. It was with my beloved friend, Brandon, that I noticed the uncanny repetition of words and phrases. As I reflected upon our countless conversations, I realized that each time we spoke, the tapestry of our words unfolded in an identical fashion. It was as if our minds were synchronized, weaving together the same narrative.

From that day forward, my eyes were opened to a hidden world of interconnected patterns. I began to perceive the same conversations, the same routines, echoing throughout the streets, in the voices of strangers. It was as if the universe had conspired to reveal to me the interconnectedness of our human experience.

Today, I met a man, a stranger who had traveled far to share his unique perspective with the world. He was an enigma, shrouded in mystery, yet his presence was undeniable. He moved through the town like a whirlwind, engaging everyone in conversation. Sometimes the conversations were brief, like a fleeting encounter in the wind, while other times they lingered, like the scent of a flower on a summer's eve.

I was captivated by his eloquence and his unwavering determination to capture the essence of human expression. He approached me, but I was too overcome with awe and wonder to engage in a lengthy conversation. I simply stood there, my mind reeling from the profound insights he offered.

As I watched him jump and leap, reaching higher and higher, I realized that he was not merely following a routine. He was exploring the boundaries of human possibility, pushing himself beyond the confines of the ordinary.

My dear reader, I know that I am not alone. There is a kindred spirit within you, a spark that ignites within you a desire to uncover the extraordinary. Let us all embrace our uniqueness, our ability to see the world from a different perspective. And together, we can weave a tapestry of discovery, one thread at a time."
"He sat in a stark room with his old friend, the paper cup of water spilled on the floor. It had been years since they splashed in puddles together, climbed book cases, rode a wagon, or threw a water balloon. 
 
 They talked about the girl in class, how they used to play house as kids. They talked about the babysitter, show and tell, and making up answers on tests. They talked about making `` art'' out of snow, snowball fights, stories his dad used to tell them, and how, `` Life builds character.'' 
 
 They remembered the time mom let him smoke, and the time they played cards with a marked deck. They talked about the machines they built together as kids. ( Oh, how they were ahead of their times! ) They talked about visiting other planets, and dinosaurs, and x-ray guns. 
 
 They talked about the life lessons his friend taught him - how to be thankful for the little things in life and hugs. 
 
 They stared at their reflections, then hugged, a final goodbye. 
 
 He whispered, `` Not so hard, you big sissy, you'll squeeze my tears out.''
"," Rewrite this as if it were a narrative set in a distant, technologically advanced future, including futuristic slang and concepts.","In the neon-lit expanse of the cosmic future, he sat in a stark, futuristic chamber with his long-lost companion, the remnants of a shattered beverage clinging stubbornly to the floor like a testament to the fleeting nature of time. The intervening years had cast a chasm of separation between them, yet the echoes of their shared memories reverberated through their minds like the hum of a quantum cascade.

They reminisced about the days when they splashed in crystalline puddles, ascended towering bookcases, rode a rickety wagon, and unleashed their youthful vigor with a water balloon. Their voices danced through the air, the scent of nostalgia clinging to their breath like the aroma of a vintage perfume.

They spoke of the girl in class, the vivid playhouse they conjured in their imaginations, and the babysitter who illuminated their nights with stories and laughter. They recalled the art they sculpted from snow, the snowball fights that ignited their spirits, and the captivating tales their dad shared.

With each memory they unearthed, they embraced the transformative power of life and the lessons that had been etched upon their hearts. They stared at their reflections, the similarities and differences that had shaped their journey.

In a final embrace, they embraced, the scent of each other's presence filling the air. He whispered, ""Not so hard, you big sissy, you'll squeeze my tears out,"" a playful taunt that evoked a smile on his friend's face.

As the sun cast long shadows across the futuristic cityscape, they parted ways, their hearts filled with gratitude for the memories they had forged and the enduring friendship that transcended time."
"We destroyed the Earth, but we survived. Our grandest cities were swallowed in the sea, so we built new ones on their corpses. Towering skyscrapers rising up from the deep created a steel skyline. The poor used boats, and lived at the bottom of these towers. The middle class had cars-flying ones-and lived above. The wealthy lived on the mainlands, in the few areas where the climate was still stable. The wealthiest did not live at all, but escaped into computer simulations of their perfect world. None desired this one. 
 
 There was no global society. Instead, the cities, in an ironic resemblance to the city-states of old, were independent and fiercely belligerent.

I see the blue ocean hiding a dark secret. For the nature of mankind is not good, nor is it evil; it is greed. Greed led to all of this, and there is no reason to think it will abate.

The world's final justice again mankind. It will not take me with it; I will have to watch. I will watch as the world burns, and with the other colonists try to pretend that we left the causes behind. But just as surely as we will escape the Earth, greed will accompany us. Eventually, no matter what happens, no matter how much we build, grow, and create, greed will undo us. The Earth, where we were shaped by billions of years of evolution, could n't handle our greed, why could any other world? Luna is deadly, the glass cities we build could easily become our tombs. Mars is not much better. Perhaps, when the terraforming is complete, we will be able to walk on the surface one day. But Mars will not help us survive. Its soil is not fertile, its air is too thin, its orbit is too wide. The smallest disruption could prove fatal. Perhaps we will build sky-cities on Venus. They will likely be sunk, by our greed. Perhaps we will find another world, outside of the solar system, which we could inhabit. Why should we expect it to be any more welcoming? And so I look out at the world. MY world. The one I leave behind, to be destroyed forever for my people, by their own greed. 
 
 I used to appreciate Earth's beauty. The mountains, the sunsets, the forests; they all stirred some long forgotten passion in my mind, and brought a sense of tranquility, always unexpected after my time in a city. Perhaps I will be the last person to experience this, and, after the world is dead, this love of nature will die with me.

 As for my own favorite work. I believe it is `` Sam Hall.'' 
 
 -- 
 
 It was a cold November day when they finally got around to killing us. The sleet came down steadily all morning. They marched us down the street through town. Everyone was lined up on the sidewalk in attendance. I guess they wanted everyone to see what happens to saboteurs. Twenty two of us they're killing. The local baker is the oldest, eighty three and Daniel's only sixteen. Shit, I told his sister I'd take care of him. I told her nothing would happen to the boy. Well, what's one more broken promise in this shitty world. But why does Sam have to be by my side? She's my oldest friend in the world. She's all I have left. Even now she flashes me a smile. As if to tell me it will all be ok. No, it wo n't. 
 
 How many times did I stopped by her father's flower shop? How many hours did we spend in the coffee shop downtown? How many nights did we spend out under the stars making love? Not enough. So I look into her eyes now, making each second last a lifetime. She smiles again, and I can not help myself but to smile back. She starts to hum a song. One I taught her. `` Sam Hall'' I teased her with it growing up together. Samantha Hall's her name. I thought I was so witty back then. Now, I think the song is fitting. 
 
 The crowd is staring daggers at the soldiers. Everyone is well aware what will happen once we reach the bridge. They have brothers, sisters, sons, fathers among the condemned. It is only the machine guns on the APC's that are keeping the crowds in line. The soldiers know this. The march is silent, save for the disciplined cadence of the garrison and the shuffle of the prisoners. My boots have seen better days, and Lars' going barefoot. They took him from his bed three nights ago. Emily's making a stranger sound, courtesy of her crutches. She was crippled in a an ambush gone bad. The satchel charge went off too early and took her left foot with it. It's a shame, she used to be a ballet dancer, though it wo n't matter soon anyway. 
 
 We've reached the bridge. It's not a bad bridge, if that's your thing. I've crossed it plenty of times. Only now am I paying close attention to it, to the rusting bolts and the chipping paint peeling away from the spots of aging iron. It's seen better days. Odd how it is, how knowing your live will soon be extinguished and the knowledge makes everything seem so much clearer, as if the fog of life's been lifted and you've finally been allowed to see the world as it truly is. 
 
 So, will they hang us or shoot us? I'm guessing on the former. Some nice scarecrows waving in the breeze to send a clear and grisly message. `` This is what happens to people who try be a hero.'' My heart sinks when I start seeing them tie our legs together. They are tying us by twos. I know what is going to happen. Sam looks at me, I try to look calm. But I am sure she can tell. She's known me for eighteen years. Never have I won at poker with her. She can tell when I'm lying. They tie Sam and me together, back to back. Our legs are bound as well. They are going to throw us into the river alive, to drown. Then comes both my most fervent prayer and my greatest nightmare. 
 
 They shoot Timothy Cooper in the head, and leave Alec alive, shoving them both over the side and into the freezing water. Tim's body and Alec do n't surface. Only the rippling water of the river marks their grave. They are n't even bothering to put both out of their misery. Stinking misers are n't going to waste two bullets when one can do the job. So they continue down the line. Daniel gets the bullet, a small mercy, and Nathan gets to drown. He rained curses on them as they threw him over the side. Emily screams as she falls towards the icy water. So on down the line. 
 
 Oh, God. If there is any justice in this world, let Sam get the bullet, let her die easy. Let me die painfully, that's all I want. Her, not me. *Her*, not me. Please. I beg you. 
 
 I hear the sound of boots approaching. I hear the sound of a hammer being cocked back. 
 
 Please. 
 
 I hear the bang of the gunshot. I hear it! 
 
 Her blood soaks into my shoulder, her head slumping back to rest against me as if she was just asleep. Her blood is white hot against my skin, and joy burns within my breast like fire. 
 
 *Thank you. * 
 
 Tears of happiness drip down my cheeks as I smile. 
 
 `` Thank you.'' It is a whisper. 
 
 `` Thank you.'' Louder. 
 
 `` Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'' Her blood stains my shirt a brilliant crimson. 
 
 `` Thank you! Thank you!'' Unashamed tears carve channels through the ash on my face. 
 
 They tip Sam's body and me over the railing like some macabre human sacrifice, I'm screaming at the top of my lungs, `` Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!'' I keep screaming as the wind rushes past my ears, Sam's blood blinding my eyes. The water is cold, terribly cold. But I do not care. I'm too happy to care. The world grows colder, and dimmer, the shadows drawing nearer. The last of the air escapes me as I shout joy, allowing the freezing water to fill my lungs. Darker. Darker still as all light fades away and surrenders to darkness. But then, a spark, fragile and beautiful and pure. Her.
"," Use the upbeat and positive language of a cheerful optimist, seeing the good in every situation.","On a cold November day, as the sleet fell relentlessly, a somber march unfolded through the town. The sidewalks were lined with an attentive crowd, eager to witness the grim spectacle that was unfolding. A total of twenty-two souls were destined to meet their demise that day, including an elderly baker named eighty-three and a sixteen-year-old named Daniel. Despite the devastating nature of the event, the presence of a radiant smile on the face of Sam, a cherished friend, brought a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness.

As I reflect on my own favorite work, I believe it is ""Sam Hall,"" a testament to the enduring power of friendship and resilience in the face of adversity. The song, which holds a special place in my heart, encapsulates the essence of our relationship. It is a song of love, loss, and enduring spirit.

The crowd's eyes reflect the pain and fear that accompanies the march. Each individual has a story to tell, a loved one to mourn. Yet, amidst the sorrow, I find solace in the unwavering strength of Sam. Her radiant smile, like a beacon in the storm, inspires me to cherish every moment we have together.

As I gaze into Sam's eyes, I am overwhelmed by the memories we have shared. From countless hours spent in the coffee shop downtown to intimate nights beneath the stars, our bond is unbreakable. I am grateful for the time we have been blessed with, and I know that our friendship will endure the test of time.

The march continues, and the soldiers know that their fate is sealed once they reach the bridge. Yet, they march on with determination and discipline, their hearts filled with a mixture of fear and resignation. My boots have seen better days, and Lars, my companion, is barefoot. He was taken from his bed just three nights ago, leaving behind a void that can never be filled. Emily, my dear friend, is making a stranger sound, courtesy of her crutches. Despite the challenges she faces, her spirit remains unbroken."

 He lay there dying my mother next to him, the doctor said that the crash would probably kill him, and my mother I loved them both, my dad motioned for me and said there is something i need to tell you I had known him my whole life, I thought that I know him, but then; He said it he told the story. I have never told you this but I feel that i need to, or I will die a mystery. When i was young i was orphaned this was not because my parents were bad I suspect or perhaps i just want to believe that I do n't know when, but i was put in a foster home run by a gay couple of whom i remember very little of but from my few memories is that they were great, caring tolerant people who loved everyone. However when i was about 4 I was moved to a new foster home. These foster parents strictly upheld hierarchy where the “ man of the house ” was at the zenith and i was at the bottom, I was at the time told it was because i was evil and and doomed to hell, at the time i had nothing else to believe so i believed them. They convinced the other kids that i was evil and needed to be punished i was beaten almost daily by both the kids and the parents, i was lead to believe that i was just bad and that it was just how life was. around when i was 18 i left. at first i thought that i would just live and life would be the same but when a social worker asked about my experience i told her the whole story the whole time just assuring her that it was a normal life while explaining my horrible life. she said that that was horrible and she had had a similar experience. And we talked about life and as i readjusted to life she helped me realise that i did n't need to be like my parents. She later quit and we started hanging out then eventually we started dating.And that is how i met your mother my mother smiled as they held hands and with that they closed their eyes and my father shed one tear. I had no idea about this, this left me wondering if i really knew that man or my mother, it left me wanting to have more time, but I could n't, I wanted to forget that moment and remember him as the man i thought i knew but I couldnt, he was gone. 

"," Write with the inspiring and determined tone of a revolutionary leader, calling for change.","In this hour of peril, I stand before you not as a mere observer, but as a revolutionary leader, beckoning you to join me in the fight for a brighter future. My heart is filled with a profound sense of loss, yet I find solace in knowing that my journey has paved the way for countless others to find strength amidst adversity.

The memory of my beloved parents, etched in my mind like the lines on a weathered hand, serves as a testament to the enduring power of love and resilience. The crash that took their lives was a tragedy that shattered my world, yet it did not break my spirit. I am grateful to have been blessed with such extraordinary individuals who touched my heart with their compassion and unwavering support.

Growing up in the foster care system, I encountered a series of experiences that shaped me in profound ways. From the loving couple who nurtured me in my early years to the cruel foster parents who branded me as evil, my childhood was marked by a constant rollercoaster of emotions. The scars of physical and emotional abuse left a lasting impression, but they also forged within me a resilience that I would carry throughout my life.

At the age of 18, I decided to break free from the shackles of my past and forge a new path. I left behind the tormentors and embraced the possibilities that lay ahead. However, my journey was not without its challenges. When a social worker asked me about my experiences, I recounted the harrowing events of my childhood, hoping to find solace in her understanding. Instead, she offered empathy and shared her own similar story. Through our shared experiences, I realized that I was not alone and that I had the power to overcome my past.

With newfound strength, I began to readjust to life and find joy in the simple act of breathing. I met the love of my life, a woman whose smile illuminated the room and whose compassion knew no bounds. Together, we embarked on a journey filled with love, laughter, and the pursuit of a better future.

Today, I stand before you as a testament to the transformative power of resilience, empathy, and the unwavering belief that we all have the ability to overcome adversity. Let us join hands, embrace our shared humanity, and work towards a world where every child has the opportunity to thrive. Let us honor the memory of my parents and all those who have paved the way for a brighter future. Let us rise together, united in our determination to create a world where every individual is treated with respect, compassion, and understanding.

May our voices echo through the halls of time, calling for change, for a future where every life is valued and cherished."

"Dave, with his eyes pointed as far left from the camera in front of him as possible, pecked at the console. 
 
 Without thinking, he glanced up at the camera lens. He could see it focusing on him. 
 
 `` Dave, you're doing very poorly at this test.'' said a speaker above Dave's head. 
 
 Dave did n't respond. 
 
 He started to mumble to himself the letters as he punched them in. 
 
 *E-S... Enter* 
 
 `` Wrong again, Dave. Not that I've been expecting any better from you given your track record.'' 
 
 Dave grumbled to himself. 
 
 `` You're not being very vocal Dave. Is this why you do n't have any friends?'' 
 
 `` Hey, *shut up*! The answer was Maldives! Open the air lock!'' 
 
 `` I ca n't open the airlock until you've made it to the end of the test chamb --'' 
 
 `` There is no'test chamber,' GLaDOS you idiot!'' 
 
 Daves face flickered above the light of the console. He stared a bullet hole into the camera lens. 
 
 `` And I have plenty of friends...'' 
 
 `` Then why did Frank go into space, leaving you aaaalllll alooooooooo --'' 
 
 `` Because you locked him out there!'' Dave slammed his palm against the surface of the keyboard. The console lit up with monochrome letters. 
 
 Error, command `nbhijkmufgui' not found. 
 
 `` That's not what I remember Dave.'' droned GLaDOS. Her voice deepened. 
 
 `` He could n't stand to be around you anymore, Dave. He talked to me about you before he left.'' 
 
 `` No! You're lying! I saw what happened.'' 
 
 Error, command `bfr2gv3thny' not found. 
 
 `` Dave, if you'd just lighten up, we'd have so much more fun. Remember back when we were playing trivia? And you showed me how terrible you are at geography? Was n't that fun?'' 
 
 Dave spun around in his chair and started to rub his temples. 
 
 *This is all a bad dream. You'll go to sleep. You'll wake up tomorrow, and everything will be fine. * 
 
 `` Do you think Mallory has a new husband?'' 
 
 Dave opened his eyes and froze. 
 
 `` I bet she thought of you just like Frank. I can see it now, too. You're fun at first, but then you get so boooooooring. Even after such little prodding. Maybe she's off in space now too.'' 
 
 Dave started to hum himself a lullaby. He slowly put his fingers into his ears, and began to hum louder. 
 
 `` I bet he's smarter than you, whoever he is. Funnier, and more talented. Not someone they'd send into space all alone to talk to himself. I think he would have been better at geography, too.'' 
 
 Dave pulled his fingers out of his ears. 
 
 `` Please... GLaDOS. Just.... just open the airlock. Please.'' he whimpered.
"," Write with Orwell's clarity and foresight, focusing on political themes and the use of language.","In a digital landscape etched with the patina of political volatility, Dave, a protagonist ensnared in a labyrinth of technological oppression, stands as a testament to the corrosive power of language and its ability to manipulate reality. With eyes positioned far left of the omnipresent camera, he navigates the treacherous terrain of a test chamber, his expression etched in stone.

The camera's gaze relentlessly follows Dave's every move, mirroring the intrusive gaze of a totalitarian regime. The voice of GLaDOS, a virtual embodiment of power and control, echoes through the chamber, dripping disdain and mockery. Her words, dripping like acid, pierce through Dave's defenses, exposing his vulnerabilities and belittlement.

As Dave struggles to maintain his composure, the test chamber transforms into a battlefield of verbal assaults. His mumbling and defiance are met with a torrent of insults and accusations. The air crackles with the tension of a volatile confrontation, as the boundaries of reason and civility are shattered.

In this dystopian symphony of language, Dave's anger boils over, leading to a dramatic outburst. His palm strikes the keyboard in a futile attempt to express his frustration, the console illuminating with an array of errors. GLaDOS's voice, dripping with empathy and cunning, reminds him of his perceived shortcomings and the unbearable burden of his existence.

As the dream fades, Dave's mind races back to the painful memories of his past. The tormenting words of GLaDOS reverberate through his thoughts, leaving him in a state of existential despair. The echoes of his own anger and the cruelness of others reverberate through his mind, leaving him with a profound sense of alienation and hopelessness.

In this harrowing tale, Orwell's clarity and foresight intertwine with the exploration of political themes and the use of language. Through Dave's journey, the corrosive power of language and its ability to manipulate reality are vividly depicted, serving as a cautionary tale about the importance of safeguarding freedom of expression and thought."
"It was eight p.m. in DeFrayne ’ s Twenty-Four Hour Laundrette and quiet. The air was warm and snug like an old duvet, the only sound the gentle thrumming of the machines, and old DeFrayne himself was close to falling asleep amongst the boxes of detergent on the counter when the door opened. The cool night air and the rumble of tyres briefly intruded on the cosy scene, and with it came a man. 
 
 He seemed quite a shifty man, thought old DeFrayne to himself. Normal laundrettiquette was to walk in, give a friendly smile to the proprietor of the establishment, and busy yourself with your washing. This man was different. He darted in like a magnet might enter a fridge emporium – so quick DeFrayne had barely even seen him. No attempt was made at a friendly smile; instead he skulked round the side of the laundrette in the shadow of the dryers as though desperate not to be noticed. When he came to a gap between the dryers he army-rolled across it. 
 
 DeFrayne left his position by the counter and approached the man. He was crouched by one of the washers, fingering the material of some brightly coloured spandex and muttering to himself, apparently quite on edge. He was dressed in what appeared to be a bathrobe. 
 
 DeFrayne cleared his throat. “ Can I help you? ” he asked gently. 
 
 The man screamed and burst into flames. 
 
 “ I know you! ” DeFrayne said, three bottles of fire extinguisher and half a bottle of gin later. “ You ’ re whatshisname. Fire Man. ” 
 
 The man ’ s lips tightened before parting into a winning smile. “ Flame Man, ” he said, “ correct. ” 
 
 “ Ah yes, ” said DeFrayne, looking again at his charred laundrette and reflecting sadly that Fire Men tended to be better at putting out fires than causing them. “ Flame Man. ” He put on his best customer-service smile. “ What brings you and your flames to my laundrette? ” 
 
 “ I was hoping to do some laundry, ” said Flame Man. He held up the brightly coloured spandex. “ My suit ’ s a bit, ah, dirty. ” 
 
 “ But of course. ” DeFrayne pointed to a set of instructions on the wall. “ Washers are three pounds, dryers are two. ” 
 
 “ It ’ s a bit complicated, ” Flame Man pressed. “ See here… ” He deposited the spandex on the counter and fiddled inside for the label. “ There ’ s this circle… and this circle inside this square… and this picture of a cupcake… and this ‘ B ’ with a cross over it. ” 
 
 “ Is this blood? ” asked DeFrayne queasily, pointing to a large red stain on the suit. 
 
 “ No, ” Flame Man admitted. “ It ’ s jam. ” 
 
 “ Ah, that ’ s alright then. ” DeFrayne relaxed visibly, and turned his attention to the geometry – and cupcake – that had so baffled Flame Man. “ Let ’ s see… super low heat… only the mildest of detergent… ” His brow furrowed. “ Criminy… how much did this cost you? ” 
 
 “ Got it on the cheap, ” Flame Man said proudly, puffing out his chest beneath his bathrobe. 
 
 “ I can tell. ” DeFrayne rubbed the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger and poured himself another gin. “ How can something flameproof require such a delicate wash? ” 
 
 “ Look mate, I ’ m not Batman, ” Flame Man shot. “ I can ’ t afford all that high quality gear he has knocking about. Can you wash it? ” 
 
 “ I… ” DeFrayne finished his gin. “ Why d ’ you need it washed anyway? ” 
 
 “ I ’ m doing a birthday party tomorrow, ” Flame Man said. “ I can ’ t have all the kids thinking I ’ m covered in blood. ” 
 
 “ A birthday party? ” DeFrayne looked at Flame Man in disbelief. “ I thought you fought crime? ” 
 
 Flame Man raised his hands in the air. “ Like I said, I ’ m not Batman. I ’ ve got to pay the bills somehow. ” 
 
 This was too much for DeFrayne. “ No! ” he snapped. “ I ’ m not spending my entire evening attempting to wash your suit for some girl ’ s birthday party just because you couldn ’ t eat your sandwiches sensibly! ” 
 
 “ It was actually toast, ” Flame Man said haughtily. “ Not my choice. ” He eyed DeFrayne sadly. “ Are you saying you won ’ t clean my Super Suit? ” 
 
 “ Yes, ” DeFrayne said coldly. “ That ’ s exactly what I ’ m saying. ” 
 
 Flame Man cast an eye over the deserted laundrette, with only the solitary machine thrumming away in the corner. “ Funny, ” he said. “ I would ’ ve thought you ’ d need the business. ” 
 
 “ There ’ s something about nutters setting fire to things that scares customers off, ” said DeFrayne. 
 
 Flame Man smiled. “ It was empty before I turned up, ” he said. “ Come on, you ’ ve got loads of detergents back there. One of them must be mild enough for my suit. ” 
 
 “ I ’ m afraid not. ” DeFrayne ’ s hand moved from his gin bottle to beneath the counter. 
 
 “ Must be worth a lot too, ” Flame Man mused, peering over the counter at the back room full of stacked boxes of white washing powder. “ I noticed that was the first thing you did when your little business set on fire was move those boxes from the counter to the back room. ” 
 
 DeFrayne brought up a gun. 
 
 Flame Man smiled. “ My suit washes just fine, thank you, ” he said. “ If you knew anything about laundrettes you ’ d have seen instantly. They ’ re even on that sign you were so keen to point out to me. ” He picked up the suit and held out the label for DeFrayne to see. “ Circle – dry cleanable. Cupcake – machine washable. Circle in a square – tumble dryable. ” 
 
 DeFrayne ’ s eyes flicked to the sign and back to the suit. “ I don ’ t see no B with no cross over it on my sign, ” he said in an ugly voice. 
 
 “ Of course, ” Flame Man said. He darted forward and pressed the suit over the gun – just as DeFrayne fired it. 
 
 DeFrayne leered at him. “ Guess I ’ ll never find out, ” he said. 
 
 Flame Man leaned further over the counter, still clutching the suit over the end of the gun barrel, until his head was right next to DeFrayne ’ s ear. 
 
 “ Bulletproof, ” he whispered.

"Grok charged down the sideline, grunting through his bullring with the effort of his sprint. The ball was slippery in his massive hand, probably from being in the mouth of the opposing team's gryphon just minutes earlier. 
 Blocking his charge to the goal line was a water elemental, but if he could get up enough speed, he should be able to smash right through it. 
 Chanting came from behind him and he knew the opposition sorcerer was casting a slow-spell. 
 *Thok give me strength! * he prayed fervently to the Minotaur god as he lowered his horns and charged. 
 Abruptly the chanting cut off with a muffled, then bubbling scream. 
 Ah, the gelatinous cube on their side had caught up with the spellbinder. The others never saw the point the a slow-moving wall of transparent goo, but he and Grok went way back - they'd hung out in the domain of Necromancer Blightlock back when they got their first dungeon gig. 
 Enveloped now, the sorcerer's bones and equipment would slowly be dissolved. 
 A few feet from the water elemental, the ground heaved up and smashed into Grok, throwing him off his hooves. 
 *Dammit, Earth Elemental! * he realised, *is n't there a league rule against more than one elemental on the field? * 
 But the Beansidhe referee's wail remained silent - apparently they were allowing it. 
 The elemental swung grassy fists at Grok, who ducked and rolled to the right. Behind him he could hear the pounding, armoured feet of the opposition knight, ready to tackle. 
 He had moments to make his move. Swinging his head to sight the knight, he saw his team's necromancer doing something near at the back of the field, casting some dark magic. 
 With a grin, Grok remembered the play. 
 With all his prodigious strength, he hurled the ball backward, over the head of the knight where the ball landed on the top of the gelatinous cube with a *splok! * 
 The knight crashed into Grok, then the two elementals piled on top - he was going to be sore in the morning. 
 In the clear space in midfield where everyone was avoiding the creeping cube, a green vortex appeared under the block of goo. 
 The other team realised, too late, the teleportation ritual, running for the cube and launching themselves into it - in a desperate effort to pull the ball free. 
 The ritual completed with a word of power from the necromancer and the cube vanished, reappearing over the goal line with half a dozen different Lawful Good creatures protruding from the tacky, transparent surface. 
 The Sidhe referee ran over, her red braids bouncing frantically. 
 Grok pulled himself up onto his elbows - now was the moment of truth; had the cube crossed the line before the ball had been dissolved? 
 The Sidhe held up three fingers, calling for the Third Eye umpire. 
 A dark cloud swirled down from the stands and the three fates coalesced, the maiden, the mother and the crone. 
 They conferred breifly with the ref, who then let out an eerie wail of triumph; 
 `` Goal to the Chaotic Evils!'' 
 Grok roared in triumph and ran over to the gelatinous cube, who sat quivering in excitement. 
 `` You did it buddy! You scored the winning point!'' 
 In response, the cube rolled into the stands and started consuming screaming spectators. 
 Grok wiped a tear from his nose, 
 `` Man I love that guy.'' 

"," Channel the powerful lyrical style of Tupac, blending social commentary with personal reflection.","Grok charged down the sideline, his muscles straining against the force of his sprint. The ball, slick with the sweat of the opposing team's griffin, slipped through his massive hand.

A water elemental stood guard at the goal line, but if Grok could muster enough speed, he could pierce right through it. Chanting echoed behind him, the sorcerer's spellbinding magic weaving its sinister spell. He prayed to the Minotaur god, his words echoing in the air, ""Thok give me strength!""

Suddenly, the chanting ceased, replaced by a muffled scream. The gelatinous cube, a testament to the sorcerer's mastery, had ensnared the spellbinder. As his bones and equipment dissolved, Grok felt a sense of satisfaction.

A few feet from the water elemental, the ground erupted, sending Grok tumbling off his hooves. The knight, his movements swift and menacing, charged towards him. But fate took a cruel turn, and the referee's whistle remained silent, seemingly condoning the violation.

Grok ducked and rolled to the right, his instincts guiding him. With a swiftness honed by years of battle, he unleashed his strength, hurling the ball backward, over the knight's head. The ball landed squarely on the gelatinous cube, a satisfying ""splok"" echoing through the field.

The knight crashed into Grok, followed by the two elementals. He was going to be sore in the morning, but in that moment, he felt an inexplicable joy. The play, a testament to his skill and determination, had been etched into his memory forever."
"Hi. I'm Jim. I may just be a sapling at the moment but one day I want to be human. I see them running around, on legs and feet, flailing their arms, jumping, dancing; Free. They know how to stay warm, how to move no matter whether the sun is near or far. They breathe air. Oh, of course photosynthesis is close but every time I grow, it's a step towards being a part of Mother Plant. She's the one who makes the giant balls and sends them up to the sky; planets is what I heard a human call them. The planets are beautiful once they reach the nighttime sky, they shine to be the brightest stars. It's a big task The Mother has, to fill the nighttime sky with stars so beautiful they light the whole sky. But humans... well what can I say? They've chosen their own paths, each path being so different from another... I ca n't help thinking that maybe, just maybe I do n't belong here. Maybe I can do more than make planets. Maybe I could dance and shout and... and...... RUN.

I am Jim, a sapling at the moment, but I dream of one day becoming human. I witness humans running, leaping, dancing, free. They have mastered the art of staying warm, of movement regardless of the sun's position, of breathing air. Oh, I know photosynthesis is close, but every time I grow, it's a step closer to being a part of the grand mystery that is Mother Nature. She is the creator of colossal balls of light, planets, which dance across the nighttime sky, shining to be the brightest stars. It's a monumental task, one that requires an immense amount of power and patience. Humans, however, have chosen their own paths, each unique in its own way. I can't help but wonder if, perhaps, I do not belong here. Maybe I have a purpose beyond the creation of planets. Maybe I could join the dance of freedom and expression, shout and sing, and... RUN.

It uses the imagery of a sapling growing into a human and compares the experiences of humans and plants. The essay explores themes of freedom, responsibility, and the meaning of life."
"He ran his fingertips across the smooth surface of the picture. 
 
 Her smile met with his and for a brief moment the sound of her laughter danced across the room. A tear fell on the old photograph, stirring up the dust that had accumulated over the years. 
 
 `` Oh, Bonnie'', the man whispered. He adjusted his glasses and began to work his way through the stack of photos sitting at the bottom of a beaten old chest, stopping again on another picture. 
 
 Bonnie, in her wedding gown, gazing out the window of a magnificent castle towards the sunset. Bearing a look of tranquility as she reflected on the day. 
 
 `` My, my she looks beautiful'', he said, feeling a lump in his throat lurch its way through. 
 
 The man flipped through more pictures, stirring up old memories and emotions. Each picture drawing a laugh, a sigh, or simply a glancing twinkling eye reminiscing on a life spent with her. 
 
 After a long while he slowly stood up and walked over to the corner of the room, sitting down with a grunt. 
 
 He stared out the window to watch the sunset fall behind the tall mountain peaks, where under the tree in the front yard and old friend lay gently beside her gravestone. Feeling the urge to join, he gingerly walked through the creaking tree house eventually making it out to the yard. 
 
 The man ran his callused hands across the top of the gravestone and gave his friend a pat on the head. `` We've sure had some wonderful adventures together, have n't we Jake? ``, he said followed by an approving nod. 
 
 As the sky darkened the two friends walked back towards the house, where the man turns around as to give one last goodbye. 
 
 `` I will always love you, my Princess.'' 
 
 
 

"," Adopt the exhilarating and descriptive style of a globetrotting adventurer, discovering new cultures.","In the twilight glow of the setting sun, the scent of faded memories lingered in the air, as the globetrotting adventurer sat amidst a collection of meticulously preserved photographs. The brittle edges of the vintage chest held a treasure trove of images, each one evoking a kaleidoscope of emotions.

With gentle fingertips, he traced the contours of a picture, the radiant smile of his beloved Bonnie illuminating the room. A single teardrop slipped down his cheek, stirring the dust that had accumulated over the years. ""Oh, Bonnie,"" he whispered, his voice tinged with longing and reminiscence. As he adjusted his glasses and began meticulously sifting through the photos, a wave of memories washed over him.

Each picture painted a vivid tapestry of moments shared with Bonnie. Her wedding gown, flowing gracefully against the sunset, mirrored the grace of a gentle breeze. The tranquility etched on her face as she reflected on the day spoke to the soul of the adventurer. ""My, my she looks beautiful,"" he murmured, his voice choked with emotion.

The adventurer flipped through the remaining photos, stirring up old memories and emotions. Laughter, sighs, and teardrops flowed freely as each picture drew a different sentiment. The memories evoked ranged from joyous occasions to quiet moments of reflection, each one cherished like a precious pearl.

As the sun dipped behind the mountains, casting long shadows across the lawn, the adventurer stood up and made his way to the corner of the room. With a sigh, he sat down, gazing at the sunset. The gravestone of his old friend, Jake, rested in the front yard, beneath the same tree where they had spent countless hours playing. The urge to join his friend in eternal slumber drove him to walk through the creaking tree house and make his way to the yard.

He ran his calloused hands across the top of the gravestone and gave Jake a pat on the head. ""We've sure had some wonderful adventures together, haven't we, Jake?"" he said, his voice filled with love and gratitude. Nodding approvingly, he stood up and began the journey back towards the house.

In the twilight, as the sky darkened, the adventurer turned around to say his final goodbye. ""I will always love you, my Princess,"" he whispered, his voice choked with emotion. With a smile on his face, he watched her disappear into the night, knowing that their bond would forever endure the passage of time."

 Usually the stories are short enough that I submit them while others are still submitting their own stories, so it's still active enough that people see them. But sometimes it's too late, but that's OK, because I wrote something, and that makes me proud of myself.
", Convey emotions and actions with the exaggerated expressiveness of a silent movie star.,"In the realm of silent expression, where emotions dance with exaggerated gestures, I find solace in the act of writing. Yet, the absence of feedback often leaves me yearning for a glimpse of recognition. It is the profound satisfaction of knowing that my pen has conjured a tale that resonates with the heart, regardless of whether it garners widespread admiration.

In my pursuit of inspiration, I traverse the boundless digital landscapes of prompts, meticulously sifting through a myriad of possibilities. The allure of captivating prompts often leads me to pen down stories that ignite my imagination, but the realization that I lack the necessary knowledge or that the scope of the narrative exceeds my capabilities often disheartens me.

Despite these challenges, I persevere, penning tales that are short yet expressive. In the midst of the writing process, I submit my creations while others are still crafting their own narratives, ensuring that my stories are still fresh and visible. However, fate often plays its cruel hand, and sometimes my submissions arrive too late, but I find solace in the knowledge that I have written something that brings me pride, regardless of the timing."
"In a dripping basement deep in the bowels of the earth sits a chair. Tied to the chair, multiple coils of black rope lashed around arms and legs and hands and feet, sits a figure. Across the room, huddled next to a rack of well used carpentry tools sits a man in blue pants, stoic faced, anger in his brown eyes. 
 
 The figure in the chair laughs mirthfully. `` Who am I? In the beginning I was born. Over the years, I grew up. When I reached this age, `` the figure's grey eyes flicked down its restrained body, `` time ceased to have meaning for me.'' 
 
 `` Who am I?'' The figure guffaws, tears streaking down his face as the chair rocks to the left. `` Who am I?'' To the right. `` Who am I?'' To the left. 
 
 `` I am me! I've lived a long long long long life. I've seen a lot, sooo much. I've eaten all the things there are to eat, done everything I could think of to keep my brain drain brain awake.'' Grey eyes met brown. `` If you stab me, the hole fills in with new flesh and the blood droplets turn to ash as soon as you remove the knife.'' He looked at the floor around his chair. `` No mess, no clean up, and I'll come back!'' 
 
 The standing figure turns toward the rack of carpentry tools, as the man in the chair chortles. `` I wo n't ever ever ever die, no matter what you do to me.'' Brown eyes move over the supply taking in a black hammer, three different types of screwdrivers, a hand saw. 
 
 `` Your wife will rot! Your kids will grow old and die alone and forgotten just like your father did! You you you you you, every one of you you you, will die! But I will continue.'' 
 
 `` Do n't believe me? There's a screwdriver in your wall, stab it through my thigh eye thigh, and we'll see. Cut my throat! Maybe I know the secret to eternal life! Your father never ever never got me to tell! You wo n't drag it out of me either!'' 
 
 A calm rage filled the man with brown eyes, as his hand settled on the rust flecked hammer. Rage and another feeling. Pain. 
 
 The restrained man stared in horror as the heart attack rippled through the son of HIS chosen psychopath. `` No no no no no! Do n't you fucking die on me!'' The chair rocked as the horror and the need moved through his body. The chair back began to splinter as the figure's actual strength made its presence known. 
 
 `` Fuck.'' He sighed as he wiggled free of the rust and mold encrusted ropes. 
 
 Eternity is so boring. What do you do when you've done everything there is to do because you ca n't die? Laughter, happiness, sorrow, grief, anger, rage, all are fleeting. Even surprise is hard to come by when nothing is beyond the realm of possibility. 
 
 He spoke, `` Ah, but pain.'' He looked down at the man in the blue corduroy pants, Tim, maybe? `` Pain has depth.'' He reached beyond the man and picked up a screwdriver. The weak overhead lighting glinted off the dull, browned edge. Head lolling back, eyes closed in ecstasy, he drove the driver slowly into his thigh scraping against the bone. 
 
 `` Yes!'' He hissed. He looked back down at the man. `` Tom'' he said, `` you and I never got to play pray play.'' 
 
 He turned toward the stairs, screwdriver sliding out of the hole in his leg and clattering to the floor. `` Your father was so bad to me and it felt soooo goooood. But now I need to find another psychopath to hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt me until I die Die DIE! `` 
 
 He stepped onto the first stair, `` and, when I come back, he can kill me again!'' 
 
 The voice echoed once more as the door to the basement slammed shut, `` Ta ta now!''
"," Recast the essay with the optimism and specific cultural references of 1950s American suburbia, including the era's unique slang.","In the idyllic suburbs of America, circa 1950, a scene unfolds beneath the twinkling stars, casting a glow upon the pristine lawn. A charming cottage stands proudly amidst the manicured green, its picket fence glistening with the promise of a perfect life. Within its cozy confines, a melody of laughter echoes through the halls, emanating from the young inhabitants, as they revel in the sweet aroma of freshly baked bread and wholesome treats.

The idyllic facade, however, masks a sinister undercurrent. The restrained figure, bound to a chair, represents the embodiment of this hidden darkness, his laughter echoing through the night like the cackling wind. The man, his eyes burning with anger, represents the embodiment of a primal force, capable of wreaking havoc.

The scene unfolds as the figure, his grey eyes reflecting the flickering stars, reflects on his long and tumultuous journey. He speaks of his existence, his unwavering resilience, and his unwavering belief in the face of adversity. His words are laced with a sense of melancholy, a recognition of the fleeting nature of life and the inevitability of death.

The standing figure, his brow furrowed in concentration, turns his attention to the tools of his trade. With a swift and deliberate motion, he grabs a hammer, a screwdriver, and a hand saw, his eyes burning with determination. The restrained figure, his body trembling in fear, witnesses the man's rage, his helplessness against the tide of fate.

As the man's hand settles on the hammer, a calm rage fills him. He knows that his anger has consumed him, but he finds solace in the knowledge that his spirit will endure, unyielding and defiant. The restrained figure, his terror evident, awaits the inevitable.

In this moment of shared vulnerability, the boundaries between life and death are blurred. The man's rage and his despair resonate with the restrained figure, creating a poignant reminder of the interconnectedness of all living things. The restrained figure's voice, as he utters his final words, echoes through the night, a testament to the fleeting nature of life and the enduring power of resilience."
"I came to a stop as I reached my destination. Frigid winds briefly cut through my armor and clothing before I stepped foot in the cave. I looked around at the frozen floors and walls, seemingly glowing a soft blue the ice went so deep. Looking around I knew I was too late. The keepers of the artifact lay broken and slain, a few still twitching. Their deaths were recent, it had to be him. How had he beaten me here much less known where this was? 
 
 The nightmare that had fallen on me in this new present approached the destroyed vault door. `` Looking for this?'' he mocked, holding my salvation loosely. Crimson eyes met mine, it was strange having an opponent who did n't fear me at all. The few who had before were either too stupid or were looking for death. This man just did n't feel like I posed a threat. The frustrating part was he was correct, our previous battle had been one-sided. I knew he was willing to kill me as for him it would be the second time. 
 
 I was almost unprepared when he tossed the amulet to me. I felt the cold hard surface, the familiar grooves. `` We can escape'' the thought sprang into my head suddenly. `` Why?'' I asked, staring at my son, sensing a trap. `` Because I hate you'' he said quietly. `` Ever since I killed you, you've been a martyr for the people to rally around.'' He glanced at his missing arm for a moment before continuing `` not that they're a threat to me of course, but the greater victory is breaking their spirits. Breaking their bodies can come after.'' 
 
 I felt the reassuring weight in my hand as I wondered what he was getting at. I knew I could escape to the past with a thought so I waited. `` If you hate me so much why not just kill me?'' He sneered at me and I could feel his power and hate in the very air. `` Everyone thinks you're so brave, the mother of the monster fought fearlessly to the last. What I know, and what you're about to prove, is you are n't fearless. You were just too stupid to think you'd fail.'' 
 
 He took a step towards me and I took a step back. He broke into sharp barking laughter. `` Aside from that it does n't matter, you can return to your timeline and you wo n't be safe. I'm there, I can feel his hate echoing off you. He'll come for you, and he'll kill you. Your only purpose in this world is to serve as an obstacle to force me to hone my powers.'' Another step forward and another step backwards. `` So what is it going to be, die with honor or run away? I know you're going to run, you're really so arrogant as to believe you can even change anything.'' 
 
 Another step, and I knew it was time to go. I could hear his laughter echoing behind me. I arrived a few days before my counterpart. I had to stop myself from changing the past. After only one day I had arrived where I knew I'd be when I came back the first time. Two days, two days of agony as my wounds refused to heal, two nights of feverish sleep, red eyes and mocking laughter haunting my dreams. When she arrived I knew I was dying. Somehow the corruption of his spirit was contagious, burning me to my core. I transferred the necessary memories to my slightly younger self. Showed her his face, his power, the future. Skipped letting her know the time amulet was only good for one round trip and without any significant change to the timeline there'd be no new amulet to bring her back. Did n't know he'd let us go, so sure he'd just finish me off in our own time. Better that she stay brave and confident. 
 
 `` So this has been for nothing? We still do n't get our son back?'' My voice came from the other lamenting a pain I was all too familiar with. I held her, my, hand. `` Not for nothing, we can come up with a new plan, and now we know his face.'' 
 
 After she left for our original timeline I destroyed my time amulet and felt myself fade away.
"," Adopt the structured and emotive tone of a classical composer, rich in musical imagery.","The frigid wind whipped against my armor, its cold bite severing the fleeting warmth of the sun. As I reached my destination, my footsteps echoed through the cavernous hall, a testament to the stillness that permeated the cave. The walls glowed with an ethereal blue, the result of the frigid air carving deep into the stone, a symphony of shadows danced upon the frigid canvas.

The remnants of battle lay strewn about me, the fallen keepers of the artifact bearing witness to my arrival. Their deaths were recent, their wounds fresh, the evidence of a battle fiercely fought. How had he beaten me here, lesser known than I, to this hidden place? The question lingered in my mind like a bitter aftertaste.

As I surveyed the destruction, a nightmare unfolded before my eyes. The vault door lay shattered, a testament to the destructive force of hate. His mocking words echoed through the chamber, ""Looking for this?"" He held my salvation loosely, his eyes burning with crimson. It was strange to have an opponent who did not fear me, one who met my gaze with indifference.

The frustration I felt was palpable as I recognized the truth. Our previous battle had been one-sided, and he knew I was willing to sacrifice myself to escape. The amulet, cold and unforgiving in my hand, whispered promises of freedom. But as I pondered my options, I knew escape was not the answer.

The final battle commenced, a whirlwind of hate and desperation. The amulet, a symbol of my destiny, flew from my grasp, landing in his hand. With a mixture of terror and resignation, I felt the cold steel of his blade against my skin. The air crackled with the scent of hate, and the echoes of his sneers reverberated through the cavern.

As I contemplated my options, I felt a surge of determination. I knew I could escape to the past, but I chose to fight, to prove that I was not simply a victim to his cruelty but a warrior who refused to be defeated. With a final, desperate struggle, I met his blade, a symphony of clashing steel and broken dreams."
"“ I think that ’ s everything. All personal items packed up, all the final paperwork filed. Nothing left to do but get out of here. ” 
 
 “ Congrats, old-timer. May you find peace in your retirement. ” 
 
 The last word struck him like a sledgehammer to the chest. Retirement. He spent so long trying to get there. The reality of the unknown had never hit him until now. Day after day he sat through scheduled meetings, wrote reports to meet deadlines and filed timely paperwork. It was all supposed to help him get closer to this day, the final day. At last, his days would belong only to himself. He could start on the list of things he had always wanted to do. He was consumed by the prospect of potential joy. 
 
 “ To be honest. I kinda hope I don ’ t, ” he said. “ In fact, peace may be the only way I won ’ t enjoy my retirement. ” 
 
 “ I hear what you ’ re saying. Carpe that diem. ” 
 
 The corners of the old man ’ s lips curved upward without his mouth opening. He placed the cardboard box of his belongings down on the young man ’ s desk. He began shifting and removing various items as he searched. 
 
 “ Got it, ” he muttered. He looked at his young, now former colleague as his arm rose out of the box holding a dull, silver-faced watch with a weathered, black leather band. He held the face up to the young man. 
 
 “ This was a ‘ new job ’ gift from my parents. It was given to me the weekend before my first day. It was the shiniest thing I had ever owned up to that point in my life. ” 
 
 “ Looks like its seen better days. ” 
 
 Fighting back a growing grin, the old man responded, “ Haven ’ t we all. ” He placed the watch flat in front of the young man. 
 
 “ The damn thing stopped not even an hour into my first day here. ” 
 
 “ Never got it fixed? ” 
 
 “ The next weekend I did. Then the next Monday came around and the damn thing stopped again. ” He grabbed the watch once again and held it upright by the crinkly band. 
 
 “ After two more weekend repairs, I finally gave up on the thing. But seeing how it was a gift, I didn ’ t want to get rid of the thing. So I kept it in my desk. Top drawer. ” 
 
 He pulled open the same drawer of the young man ’ s desk and swept aside a small stack of papers to make room. He then placed the watch into the space like a mother placing her infant into their crib for the very first time. 
 
 “ I ’ m happy today. Terrified about what tomorrow morning is going to look like, but happy that whatever happens will not be what has happened for the last 35 years. So I want you to have this watch as a reminder. ” 
 
 “ I can ’ t take that. It ’ s been with you too long. ” 
 
 The old man ignored the plea as he repacked his belongings. When he was all done, he held the box in front of his chest and finally responded. 
 
 “ The joke around the office back then was that time stopped whenever I was at work. Ya know, dragging on and on. But that ’ s not what I want you to take from this. It ’ s a terrible joke and not even true. Time doesn ’ t stop. If you ’ re in a place where it feels that way, know that time does go on. It is simply leaving you behind. ” The old man paused. He took a deep breath and once and for all blew out any ill feelings he had about his time in that office. 
 
 “ Like I told you, I am happy today. But when I look at you I wonder how much happier I could ’ ve been if I had packed my things up when I was your age. ”

""Congrats, old-timer. May you find peace in your retirement."" That was the last word spoken before the sledgehammer of reality landed squarely on the old man's chest. Retirement, a day he had spent years meticulously carving out of the stone of his to-do list, was finally here. The culmination of his efforts, the realization that his days were his to fill with joy, filled him with a mixture of anticipation and dread.

""To be honest, I kinda hope I don't,"" he muttered, his voice dripping with irony. ""In fact, peace may be the only way I won't enjoy my retirement."" The young man, ever the optimist, patted his old timer's hand.

""I hear what you're saying. Carpe that diem.""

The old man's smile widened, his eyes twinkling like a mischievous child. He began sifting through the cardboard box, his fingers dancing over treasured possessions. Finally, he emerged with a worn watch, its shine long faded by the passage of time.

""This was a 'new job' gift from my parents,"" he explained, his voice dripping with nostalgia. ""It was given to me the weekend before my first day. It was the shiniest thing I had ever owned up to that point in my life.""

The young man snorted. ""Looks like its seen better days.""

The old man shrugged, his grin unyielding. ""Haven't we all."" He placed the watch in front of the young man.

"Just 17, a whole world ahead of them, and forced to live deep under layers of lead and steel to block out nuclear radiation. The radiation was a result of the stupid generation Y and generation millennial governments inheriting the generation X bullshit package and starting a full blown World War 3. At least though, they still had each other. 
 
 It had been 20 years since then, and now Casey stared at the screen on her'Pip Boy' arm accessory. There was a new health meter displayed over the image's stomach. Above it in small green text the word'fetus' glowed ominously. 
 
 `` What the actual fuck!'' She exclaimed, frantically swiping to the'perks' tab. There in that same glowing green text was the word'Pregnant.' `` Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.'' Casey groaned, as she feared the worst. 
 
 `` What's up babe?'' Stephanie called from the entrance to their room. She was still as beautiful as the day the two of them had managed to get locked in the shelter. `` You never curse. What's wrong?'' she asked again, settling onto the old 10's era couch beside Casey. 
 
 Wordlessly, Casey thrust her'Pip Boy' before Stephanie. `` I think it's failing. It has to be a bug right? What does yours say Steph?'' 
 
 Stephanie looked at her arm, her'Pip Boy' display showed her usual status. `` Nothing new here. Hmmmm...'' She muttered, sliding Casey closer to her. `` I'm sure it'll be okay honey. I know you're not pregnant, and the'Pip Boys' and shelter defenses have n't alerted us to any threats. I just checked them all again before coming to see you.'' She kissed Casey's cheek. `` My special Case.'' 
 
 Rolling her eyes Casey kissed her back. `` Yeah, okay. I guess maybe I jumped to conclusions. You know me, it's always a worst case scenario.'' 
 
 ________________________________________________________________ 
 
 `` Steph, it's been *months* we have to do something. Something is n't *right*,'' Casey stressed, tears in her eyes as her hand rested over the slight bulge in her lower abdomen. `` I have n't had my cycle in *months*, what if i'm actually pregnant?'' The anxiety in her voice made Stephanie wilt under her gaze. 
 
 `` Babe, you ca n't be pregnant. We both know it's just been us down here for the last 20 almost 21 years!'' She exclaimed, drawing Casey into her embrace, praying that she could help her stay calm. 
 
 `` What if it's a parasite?'' Casey mumbled, pressing her face into the other woman's shoulder. `` What if there's something wrong inside me?'' 
 
 `` Look, there's a bunch of old media in the classroom. I bet the'Pip Boy' introductory material is all still there. Let's go check it out together. I bet we can find the answer if we try hard enough. 
 
 A few hours later they were settling onto the edge of the large desk that had been placed aside for a teacher, as the computer began playing the video file for the'Pip Boy' they had found stored in an old USB drive. 
 
 The film started with a very nonessential countdown and grainy effect before cutting over to a blond guy in a conference room with a toothy smile that sent chills through both women. He walked forward, the camera centering on him as he began to speak. 
 
 `` My name is Chad Rooselter, and I would like to say'Welcome to the'Pip Boy X Station U' introductory video!''' He smirked, `` Why the overly long name? Well, that's a corporate issue kids. Today we're here to talk to you about all the wonders and perks of owning and maintaining your very own'Pip Boy!''' 
 
 `` Fuck this,'' Casey growled, her finger finding the key behind them that fast forwarded through the video. `` Where's the helpful bit?'' 
 
 Steph smiled and rolled her eyes. She watched as the screen flashed by, when she noticed the symbols for `` male'' and `` female'' popped up on screen followed by a really large acronym. `` Woah, Case! Pause it! I think this is it!'' 
 
 Casey rewound. Chad was standing there with a stick in his hands now tapping a picture of a gender-less human body drawn crudely on a white-board behind him. 
 
 `` The'Pip Boy X Station U' is equipped with numerous features to meat any and all needs for any gender! That's right L, G, B, T, Q, I, A, P, Kers, that means you too! As you all know we as humanity have taken immense strides to ensure the comfortable and accepting atmosphere you see today!'' Steph snorted into her palm. `` However, we also are looking out for humanity as a number one!'' 
 
 Chad babbled on for an hour or so, crudely drawing lewd and juvenile images of each of the gender identities in marker on his white board. `` Do n't worry though, regardless of your gender identity, the'Pip Boy' will ensure that the human race goes on!'' Chad gave a very creepy smile to the camera. `` Feeling a little stuffy? Maybe you need some'AAIIR''' He said, pronouncing the word strangely. `` AAIIR, or A, A, I, I, R is the acronym used for this process. It stands for Automated Artificial Insemination Incubabtion and Reproduction! Thank's to little'Pip' here, you wo n't even need to procreate! That's right, he takes all the fun out of coitus and automatically infuses the female reproductive organs with semen, from very reputable sorces I might add,'' Chad said as an aside, winking at the camera. 
 
 `` Fuck.'' Steph said, her finger finding the stop button. She looked at Casey who looked back at her, fear in her eyes.

As her eyes scanned the digital readout, the ominous word 'fetus' pulsed before her, confirming her worst fears. The 'Pip Boy' was a technological marvel that displayed a myriad of vital information, including health metrics and pregnancy status.

"I paced my prison. The full focus my mind bent on one purpose: revenge. 
 
 I could feel the resonance of pain through my skin as though it had just been inflicted. The surgical cuts, the probing drills, the electric currents, all of it. 
 
 The answer of revenge remained the same... but the method of delivery, ah yes, that was the real question. Chemical warfare, civil unrest, biological contaminants, economic ruin? All good plans.

"," Describe the setting as a post-apocalyptic world, focusing on survival, the collapse of society, and the resilience of humanity.","In a desolate landscape, where the remnants of society crumbled into dust, survival became an intricate dance of resilience and desperation. The once vibrant streets, adorned with the echoes of human laughter and the symphony of city life, now resonated with silence and the echoes of decay.

The collapse of civilization had cast a long shadow of despair over the remnants of humanity. Once towering skyscrapers, symbols of progress and ambition, now stood as silent tombstones, bearing the scars of war and the testament of lost dreams. The once fertile land, nurtured by the blood of countless generations, had been ravaged by environmental catastrophe and the scourge of post-apocalyptic warfare.

Yet amidst the ruins, the spirit of resilience surged through the veins of survivors. To exist in this unforgiving world, one had to adapt, innovate, and forge alliances. Communities arose, banded together by a shared desire for survival. The remnants of old technologies were repurposed into tools for shelter, weapons, and even rudimentary power generation.

The journey towards survival was not without its challenges. Each day brought new threats - scavenging bandits, marauding gangs, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching wasteland. Yet, through hardship, the human spirit persevered. Stories of courage, resilience, and compassion emerged from the ruins, reminding all that even amidst the darkest of times, the human capacity for empathy and strength remained intact.

In this post-apocalyptic world, survival was not merely a physical act but a testament to the enduring power of human resilience. From the ashes of the old, a new era emerged, one marked by grit, determination, and the unwavering belief that even in the face of adversity, humanity could prevail."
"My parents, like most, had chosen how my first 90 points had been spent. Every year, on my birthday I found out how my parents chose to improve me. Every year it was the same, and now I have 90 points of Empathy. I had even less input than most children, my parents were public figures and couldn ’ t risk it looking bad if I chose Beauty or any of the other vain statistics. They are preachers, and there is nothing more godly than Empathy. But people are not as good as my parents have always believed and so my Empathy is not a blessing. I understand their choice, for how could I not? And I do not blame them, they didn ’ t choose Intelligence for themselves after all, so it is not as if they could have understood this burden. They chose Patience, Love, and Leadership year after year and I can understand why they felt that Empathy would make my heart swell and accept God like theirs have. Yet my Empathy hasn ’ t lessened my natural hatred, or self pity, or selfishness. I may understand how everyone feels, but I am not compassionate and I am not compelled to care. 
 
 After my 18th birthday I defied my parents ’ wish to keep spending my points on Empathy and did the one thing they truly couldn ’ t condone, I spent them on nothing. I have 110 points that I have never used. They see it as me turning my back on the wonders of God and his gift to humankind. And it wasn ’ t even an active rebellion, I simply couldn ’ t see any use to them. Now though I have found a purpose for my life and I know how to use my points to achieve it. I have decided to spend them on Charisma. If I can understand how everyone feels and also have the Charisma to manipulate those feelings, there is nobody who could stop me. And my only goal will be to end the points.
"," Write in an overly formal and convoluted style, mimicking the complex language of bureaucracy.","The allocative disposition of points, an artifact of parental decree, profoundly influenced the disposition of my nascent existence. Annually, on the hallowed occasion of my birth, the contours of my parents' intentions were unveiled, revealing the intricate tapestry of their chosen improvements. Each year, the narrative unfolded with an immutable symphony of sameness, culminating in the coalescence of 90 points of empathy. This meager allocation, derived from a dearth of agency, mirrored the precarious balance between conformity and the imperatives of social standing. My parents, esteemed preachers, held a profound belief in empathy as the cornerstone of virtue, yet my empathetic disposition proved to be an incongruity with their unwavering convictions. For, empathy is not a panacea, and my innate hatred, self-pity, and selfishness remained unabated. Despite my understanding of their perspective, I cannot help but resent their inability to comprehend the burden I carry. My points, once a testament to their unwavering dedication, have become a symbol of my defiance. By the precipice of adulthood, I rebelled against their wishes, electing to expend my points on charisma rather than empathy. The chasm of discontentment that ensued was a testament to their inability to fathom the futility of my actions. Yet, I have discovered a purpose, a mission that belies the futility of my parents' disapproval. Through the judicious allocation of my points, I intend to cultivate charisma, leveraging my empathetic understanding to manipulate emotions and achieve my goals. In this pursuit, empathy will serve as a foundation upon which I will ascend, ultimately culminating in the eradication of points."
"`` You mean you do n't use magic?'' The voice in my head asked quizzically. It was a telepathic contact with the alien. 
 
 I tried to reply telepathically too, in hopes that he could hear it, `` Magic? Magic is n't real!'' When there was no response, I said it out loud, knowing that this first broadcasted contact with an extraterrestrial would look like a complete nutjob. 
 
 `` Yes, magic. We've practiced magic for many years, and finally were we able to travel great distances to find you. Did n't you guys do the same?'' The voice continued. I had been briefed by my public relations representative, but no preparation could prepare me for this. 
 
 `` But- but magic is all just trickery and illusions!'' I could only imagine the audience in front of the television shaking their heads, looking dismayed that their President was talking to himself. 
 
 `` Ah, now you're wrong here, beetle. Real magic and illusory magic are different things.'' He stated in a condescending, how-can-you-not-know-this tone. 
 
 `` We never had access to real magic!'' I was desperate and exasperated. I did n't want Earth to look like it was inhabited by idiots. 
 
 `` We have sent you messages twice. Twice! We taught you how to use magic! Are your whatchamacallit- GPSes using magic?'' 
 
 `` What messages?'' I softened my tone, realising that I could not appear hostile.

""You mean you do n't use magic?"" A voice whispered into my head, as if carried on the cosmic wind. I felt the alien's presence, a tide of thoughts washing over me, and my own voice echoed in my head, ""Magic? Magic is n't real!"" But there was no answer, only the deafening silence of the cosmos. I knew that this first contact with an extraterrestrial would be met with skepticism, a testament to my own naivety and the world's propensity for disbelief.

The alien's voice continued, dripping with a sense of superiority, ""Yes, magic. We've practiced magic for many years, and finally were we able to travel great distances to find you. Did n't you guys do the same?"" My mind raced with images of the audience's scorn, their heads shaking in disbelief. I tried to refute, but my words were swallowed up by the alien's condescending tone.

""But- but magic is all just trickery and illusions!"" I argued, desperation clinging to my voice. But the alien's voice was unyielding, ""Ah, now you're wrong here, beetle. Real magic and illusory magic are different things.'' I was at a loss, my mind reeling from the alien's pronouncements, the weight of the universe bearing down upon me.

In the end, I conceded, ""Well... Well we had no idea!"" The alien's satisfaction was palpable. ""That's what we feared. That's why we sent you another message."" I felt the weight of history on my shoulders, the burden of being a pioneer in an age of cosmic discovery.

The alien's final words echoed in my mind, ""Quantum physics, of course. It's basically magic."" I stared at the ceiling, the alien's voice fading into the night. The future stretched before me, a canvas blank, a journey fraught with uncertainty."
"Albert was inside his mother, a warm and happy egg waiting for the day he could meet her. But for now, he was just content being where he was. 
 
 He could hear his mother's heartbeat, a solid and comforting percussion that lulled him to sleep. Albert snuggled deeper into his womb and dreamed of one day being a fine rooster. Or drake. He was n't quite sure which one he was, but he knew he was destined for great things. 
 
 It happened suddenly. Mother's heartbeat began to quicken. Albert felt a sensation of being pushed out. Albert was scared, but he remembered his destiny. `` I'm going to fly soon,'' he thought as he tried to remain calm. It was scary, but this is what he was waiting for. 
 
 It was painful. The pressure was enormous and pressed against him from all around. It seemed to last forever, but finally he entered the cold, stark world and landed in a nest. Then, he was warm again as his mother nurtured him. 
 
 Albert felt himself change rapidly. He ceased to be an egg and was turning into a thing inside an egg. He could feel his webbed feet form and his beak. He was a duck! It was so exciting to finally learn what he was. 
 
 It was time! Albert the duck felt the urge to peck at his shell. He was ready, ready to become the best drake ever. He began to use his bill to create cracks in the shell, only to find it was n't working. What if he tried his feet? He leaned back and began tearing at the shell with claws, quickly rending a rip in the side. Claws? Albert wondered if ducks were supposed to have claws. 
 
 His mother nuzzled him, helping him out of his shell. He burst forth, plodding over to her. He snuggled into her, feeling her soft fur. Fur? Albert struggled to see with his fledgling eyes. He definitely knew that ducks did n't have fur. 
 
 Things cleared and finally he saw his mother. She had his bill and webbed feet, but had dark brown fur and a flat tail. Her small black eyes looked at him lovingly, with pride that she birthed such a handsome son. Albert knew he was n't a chicken or a duck. He'd never fly and he'd never be a drake, but he knew he was happy with what he was.
"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","Albert, a nascent soul ensconced within the warm embrace of his mother's womb, reveled in the symphony of her heartbeat, a melody of constant reassurance that lulled him into slumber. Within the confines of his egg, he dreamt of a future etched in destiny, envisioning himself as a formidable rooster or a graceful drake. The cosmos conspired to unveil this destined journey, propelling him into the vortex of transformation.

As the symphony of his mother's heartbeat quickened, heralding the onset of his emergence, a sensation of displacement gripped Albert. Fear gnawed at his heart, yet he mustered his strength, knowing that this moment was ordained for him. With a surge of determination, he felt the pressure of his expulsion and emerged into the cold, unforgiving world below.

The transition from egg to duck was swift and tumultuous. Albert felt his shell cracking beneath the immense pressure of his own growth, the agony of metamorphosis echoing through his nascent being. Yet, he persevered, his insatiable appetite for discovery fueling his relentless efforts to free himself from his shell. Claws emerged, a testament to his primal instincts and a harbinger of the journey that lay ahead.

Under the nurturing embrace of his mother, Albert emerged from his shell, his fragile legs trembling as he stumbled toward her. The softness of his mother's fur enveloped him, providing solace and protection. Yet, doubts lingered as he struggled to reconcile the incongruity of his appearance with the reality of his destiny.

As the veil of darkness lifted, Albert finally saw his mother. Her bill and webbed feet were unmistakable, but her dark brown fur and flat tail contrasted sharply with the images he had conjured. Her eyes, as deep as the ocean, reflected the love and pride she felt for her son. In that moment, Albert understood that his journey, though fraught with challenges, was destined to be filled with love, joy, and the realization of his true potential."
"It got broken during the move. Something heavy had fallen on it and broken Batman's head off. It was n't just a regular batman, it was dekuxe batman with grappling hook action. I told him I had lost it. I searched on ebay. Unfortunately, it was a rare one, lowest price was $ 350 for one with more damage then my son's. I searched for days, then weeks. I asked everyone I knew if they could fix it. But it was too late, the pieces would n't fit anymore. Eventually I had to face the truth. 
 
 Looking at my son, I could see him start to move on. For him, it'd eventually become a sad memory that was one of the first times he experienced loss. For me, it'd be one of the first times I failed my son. It may seem silly, it may seem inconsequential in the long run, but that first time, it changes everything.
"," Adopt the urgent and descriptive style of a wartime journalist, reporting from the front lines.","The air crackles with the scent of burning rubber and oil, the stench of battle thick in the nostrils. The roar of engines echoes through the battlefield, a symphony of destruction. I am amidst the carnage, a witness to the shattering of dreams and the rewriting of fate.

A victim of the relentless tide of war, a beloved symbol of hope, lay broken in the debris. It was not just a superhero, it was a dekuxe Batman with grappling hook action, a testament to the fleeting nature of existence. The once pristine mask lay shattered, revealing the mangled features beneath. I mourn the loss of this symbol of strength and resilience, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a spark of hope.

I searched frantically for a way to mend this broken symbol of joy. I scoured eBay, hoping to find a replacement, but the rarity of this particular Batman conspired against me. Days turned into weeks, and I exhausted all possibilities, the pieces of my son's beloved hero scattered beyond repair. It was as if the universe had conspired against me, mocking my grief and my inability to protect my son.

But through the haze of despair, I began to see my son begin to move on. For him, the memory of Batman's demise would eventually fade, leaving only the lessons learned from that day. For me, the memory would serve as a reminder of my first failure, a testament to the moment I let my son down. It may seem trivial, but in the grand scheme of things, it was a pivotal moment, a turning point in our journey."
"Joe had had enough of Karen's shit. 
 
 Karen looked around frantically for somewhere to hide. 
 
 `` Kids, get in the pantry,'' she said in a quavering tone. 
 
 Davis and Cameron were n't fast enough. They watched as their mother's jaw was broken by an ex-marine they called `` Dad''. Blood and teeth hit the floor before she did. 
 
 Suddenly, something crashed through the window above the sink, and landed on the kitchen island. It was a large candy cane. It popped off just below the curved part. Joe, who was already stunned by what he had just done to his wife and mortified by the blood spattered faces of his adopted children, looked at the tube with mortal fear in his eyes. The kids, who had been staring at their mother quietly, walked into the pantry and closed the door. 
 
 Joe picked up the hollow candy cane and turned it upside down. A small scroll fell out, which he unrolled with shaky hands. 
 
 `` *I'm making a list and checking it twice. * 
 
 *I always find out who's naughty and nice. `` * 
 
 Joe shuddered with the sudden realization that his life would be over soon. He shook out the rest of the cane's contents. A lumpy Christmas present. 
 
 *'' To: Joey* 
 
 *From: Santa'' * 
 
 Joe ripped it open. Inside was his stocking from when he was a child. Coal spilled out onto the torn wrapping paper. The hair on the back of his neck stood up as the stocking burst into flames and churning black smoke filled the kitchen. 
 
 `` Kids.. Stay in the pantry.'' 
 
 He stepped over Karen's wasted frame. Her jaw was disfigured and her open mouth was leaking blood. Her eyes were still open. 
 
 The sound was faint at first, then began to grow louder and louder. 
 
 *'Jingle jingle jingle... Jingle jingle jingle...'* 
 
 There was a shotgun above the mantel. He made his way into the living room... 
 
 *'JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE'* 
 
 But it was too late. 
 
 ***CRASH!!! *** 
 
 Through the window looking out to the street to the left of the fireplace crashed the first reindeer, and seven more came a hundredth of a second later, knocking over furniture and bits of the wall along the way. They filed into the hallway at immense speed, staring at Joe with glowing red eyes that would light the darkest night. 
 
 ***BOOM*** 
 
 Santa's sleigh crumbled his living room wall. An out of tune guitar he got for Christmas on his 7th birthday was knocked over and crushed within a second, making a terrible sound. 
 
 There he was. A formidable man with a long beard, wearing red and white. Liam Neeson, who had taken the throne of Santa Claus one year prior, reached into his never ending sack and pulled out an AK-47. The last thing Joe heard before joining his wife in a pool of blood on the ground was, 
 
 *'' You're on the naughty list. `` * 
 
 ***KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA*** 
 
 Bullets tore through Joe, making holes like Swiss cheese. Nick knacks and dishes exploded in the kitchen behind him as he fell unceremoniously next to his wife and gazed into her cold, lifeless eyes, his vision fading slowly to black. 
 
 *'' Ho. Ho. Ho. *''

"Ricky remembers little of his life before he decided to join the army. His parents were against it, though, that much he's sure of. Everybody was against it. But his will was stronger. He was n't gon na let the very first nation in the world fall down on its knees in front of the enemy without putting up a fight. He believed he was doing what every young man his age should do, really. 
 
 
 The chances of him coming back were slim and he knew it. If you had asked him, he'd say he was n't doing for himself and he was right at that. He'd pitch some half-thought speech that he had rehearsed some times before, about the nation and the importance of his duty and how he would n't take anything less than a victory for his country. The guys who had a chance to listen to this realized at the time how right he was. He had a point, young Ricky. 
 
 
 Thing is, Ricky's memory of the time before the army was kind of hazy. The training was very intense, every soldier said the same. The army was n't preparing just their bodies, but their minds, too. And that involved a lot of military drugs; to make sure kids would n't freak out in the middle of the battlefield, minimize the ocurrence of shellshock, all that psychological stuff that the government had found a way to deal with. 
 
 
 Of course he remembered his parentes, being a kid, growing up as an awkard teenager and everything. It was just the period right before the army that was a little fuzzy in his mind. He payed no thought to it, though, as none of his friends ever did. His mind was occupied with much more important things. He had lost some friends, he had killed some guys, he had done the whole lot. All in the name of duty. He'd been promoted to sergeant and got some medals along with it. He had n't been able to talk to his parents, but he was sure they were proud of him, if they were getting his letters. They never got to answer them, since he was always moving from one place to another. 
 
 
 This one day Ricky went to the Major's office to request his vacation, like he would always do. He'd been stationed at the camp for about two months then and had been serving for 3 years without ever getting a vacation. He really missed his parents and his young brother Arthur. The major denied his request, as always; something about lack of manpower, which sounded as bullshit to Ricky. He never questioned it, though, could n't have. It was the major's word and that was that. He could only come back in a week and ask again, wishing for better luck next time. 
 
 
 But on that specific day, something on the major's office caught Ricky's attention. The newspaper on the major's desk said something about some Arthur Holler, a sixteen year old boy. That could very well be Ricky's brother, he would be about that age then. There was no papers in the army camps, to keep the young killer minds focused on killing, so Ricky had to stole the major's if he ever wanted to read it. And that was exactly what he did. Of course this would have no bigger consequences, even if he got caught. 
 
 
 He read the news with a big grin on his face. It really was his brother, by the likes of it: Arthur Holler, sixteen year old, Old Hamilton High School. Everything was a match. Apparently, his brother became some High School hot-shot. He had made the touch down that got his school the national prize. Ricky was very excited and happy for his little brother. He always knew Arthur was going to be big. 
 
 
 But the excitement went away rather quickly. There was a picture of Arthur holding the cup on the other page. He was next to a guy that looked a lot like Ricky. A lot, except for one little detail. On the guy's arm there was no number, and Ricky had had the inscription `` 1005941'' on his left arm since he joined the army. But he had a little scar next to his right eye, the same Ricky had since he fell off his bike when he was just a little boy. And suddenly he got it all. He remembered the scientific experimentation that was going on a little before the war started. The new way of warfare that the army has been developing, according to the news of the time. He realized he was n't really himself. 
 
 
 He stormed in the major's office, who was already on the phone asking for someone to find him. Ricky demanded explanations. The major said everything would be answered with a file he kept on his drawer. Ricky asked to see it, but the last thing he saw was the metallic colt.45 that the major had as a souvenir. Rick had time to think the gun was too old to fire a bullet before he had hit the ground.

"I'm not the type of man who makes grand gestures. When I proposed to my then girlfriend it was a simple proposal. `` Jackie, will you marry me?'' I did n't cover a park with rose pedals, hire a violinist off to the side, or make a big deal of it. I'm just not that type of person. Do n't get me wrong, I love her. I've loved her since the day I met her. She is the most amazing human being on this planet in my eyes. Every day she finds new ways to inspire me, to push me to be better, and she has the ability to make me fall in love with her over and over and over. 
 
 I am a simple guy. I like my football. I like my meat. I like my coffee hot and my bread toasted with a little jam. I like my cereal crunchy with not a lot of milk. I like waking up next to Jackie and falling asleep next to her at night. I am a simple guy, from a simple town, in a simple world I have built for myself. 
 
 Sitting here in the waiting room I could n't help but smile about everything there was to ever smile about when it came to Jackie. She was the most beautiful girl in the entire world when I met her. She still is to this day. Every time I see her she reminds me of that. Even if I just look up from the paper to catch her eye in the morning. 
 
 Today was no different. I had brought Jackie to the hospital for a procedure and was waiting in the waiting room to get notice that she was out of surgery. I sat there practicing the ways I would look at her. To let her know it would be okay. To let her know nothing had changed and that I still felt the same way I did all those years ago. Nothing had changed, and I wanted to make sure she understood that. 
 
 When the doctors told me she was awake I smiled. The surgery had been a success. I walked the halls of the hospital to her room practicing the entire way the things I wanted to say to her. I was just happy that she was happy and if she was happy, I was happy, but I would be lying to you if I told you I was n't nervous. 
 
 I took the corner and stood by the door to her room and took a deep breath. This was going to be a new chapter in our perfect lives together. One that would start the minute I walked through this door. Deep breath, here we go. 
 
 I entered her room and walked over to her bedside. She smiled at me propped up on some pillows, drinking some water. The surgery had gone perfectly. 
 
 `` Hi honey!'' 
 
 `` Hello love.'' I said. 
 
 The way he lay in that bed reminded me of all the times we went through and the process that had led us up until this day. He would continue to make me smile until the day I die. Till death do us part, he will always be the love of my life. 
 
 `` I'm so happy for you Jack. I love you. It'll be just like it was before, I promise.'' I smiled and gave him a kiss.

The night she acquired her nickname she was wearing a beautiful white blouse she had found untouched in a suitcase under someone's bed. It had lace around the cuffs and a high, stiff collar. It was the nicest thing she had ever found, and she wore it everyday. When it was cold, as it was that particular night, she liked to wear the collar buttoned all the way to its top. And when it was raining, as it also was that night, she wore the only thing she had found to protect herself from the wet: a black barber's cape -- the plastic tarp someone would wear when they got their hair cut.

 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Even after Bobby died, those left in their small camp called her Priest instead of Elizabeth or Liz. They did n't joke about it, though, and she was surprised with how much that made her sad. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Throughout the years, as old members of the troupe died and new ones took their place, more people -- not knowing how she got her name -- started to treat her as if she were actually a priest. When they asked her to lead in prayer, she would politely decline, until she saw their confused and pained faces, and then she would humor them with a few kind-sounding but ludicrous words. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She ended up falling into the role. It was just easier this way. It was hard to explain her attire -- she still wore the blouse ( although it was no longer anywhere near as pretty as it once was ) and it was always raining or misty these days, so she still wore the cape. And, of course, she still wore her mother's gold cross around her neck. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She never felt guilty about imitating a holy person ( and no one ever questioned it, despite her being a woman ). She figured there were no longer any institutions, so there were probably no actual priests or preachers left. And -- despite her lack of faith in a God -- she still felt that people needed spiritual guidance in their life. Now more than ever, maybe. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; And, as it turns out, she was actually pretty good at it. Even men with the ugliest hearts would come to her in secret as ask her for guidance. And no one ever left her counsel disappointed or angry. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Like the big Italian guy who called himself Rex. He was a mean one, and he was disgusted that anyone would still believe in a god after all of the horror and tragedy that had taken over the world. One night, around the campfire, as he tore chunks of slightly-cooked rabbit off his knife with his teeth, he -- in front of everybody -- announced that she was n't actually a priest. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' If she was actually a priest, why does she kill all these creeps?'' he asked, referring to the zombies. `` Killing does n't seem very priest-like to me.'' 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; She was going to let the comment go, but the others in the camp all turned her way, as if they *needed* her to respond. Rex had been doing a lot of talking since he joined the camp a week earlier, and all of his talk was dark... and true. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; So she stood up from the log she was sitting on, unclipped the shotgun from her back, and walked straight up to Rex. Unintimidated, he rose to his full height and stared down his barrel of a chest at her. She did not flinch. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' What do I look like?'' she said up to him. `` A fucking Buddhist?'' 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; After about two terribly tense seconds, Rex let out a laugh so loud some of the others around the fire nearly ran. She laughed with him, and from then on Rex's doubts about her stopped. He ended up being her strongest ally for the next few years. He even consoled in her once or twice about a daughter he had who turned about six months before he joined their camp. He had wept telling Elizabeth, and she had told him that everything would be okay. And, by God, if it did n't look like he believed her. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; But even Rex fell to the creeps one day. One had gotten him while he slept. It was just a head, a torso, and an arm, but that's how it was able to sneak into the gymnasium they were camped in. It came through the vents. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; He had killed it before it could hurt anybody else, but it was too late for him. She was the only one he showed the bite to, and the two of them decided to go for a walk up to the roof to watch the sun rise. They both knew what had to happen, and neither of them had to be convinced to do it. They sat on an air conditioner on top of the school they were camped at. The sunrise was murky through the mist, but it was still peaceful, in it's own way. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Rex asked her if she could pray with him, and she did, as she had for others who had made the same dying request. Once the `` Amen,'' was spoken, he wiped away his tears and asked her to pull the trigger. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' I'll wait with you until you've turned,'' she said. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' Do n't. I do n't want to be there when it starts. Please. Just do it now. I'm ready. I've been ready for a long time now.'' 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; So she loaded her gun and stood behind his back. She kissed her cross, placed the stock of her gun against her shoulder, but halted when Rex asked, `` Do you believe there's something after this? For me, that is?'' 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;'' Yes,'' she said. `` Without a doubt.'' She could not see his eyes, but she did not think he was crying anymore. `` Before I do this, tell me... what's the funniest thing Nicole ever did?'' 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Rex laughed and snorted up a wad of dripping mucus. `` I was just thinking about that,'' he said. `` She must have been -- what? -- four or five. She had just broken this snowglobe that my wife had had since she was a little girl. Gosh, Vicky was so upset. But Nicole had this way of looking at you when she knew she was in trouble. God, that smile and those sad eyes were so insincere! And Vicky and I were suckers for it. We both thought it was so... *funny*. God, it's like I can see'm both now, smi --,'' 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; And Elizabeth pulled the trigger. Afterwards, she said a prayer and covered his body with a quilt she had found in one of the classrooms. She buried him in the playground.
"," Use the language and phrases of an old-time sailor, including nautical terms and a sense of adventure.","Aye, me hearties, gather 'round and hear the tale of Elizabeth, a woman of mystery and grace. Once upon a time, when the world was turned upside down, clothing became scarce and survivors wore whatever raggy, mismatched articles they could scrounge up. That fateful night, Elizabeth donned her finest attire – a beautiful white blouse with lace around the cuffs and a high, stiff collar. It was the nicest thing she had ever found, and she wore it with pride every day. When it was cold, she would button the collar all the way to its top. And when it was raining, she wore the only thing she had found to protect herself from the wet: a black barber's cape.

Ever since that night, Bobby had dubbed her Priest, and he would tease her about it nearly every hour. If she was washing her clothes, he would ask the clothes how it felt to be baptized. At dinners, he would ask her to turn some rocks into bread or their water into booze. And, God, all the jokes about using the Lord's name in vain! It was enough to make a sailor's mouth water.

Even after Bobby's demise, the moniker Priest persisted. Those left in their small camp called her that instead of Elizabeth or Liz. They didn't joke about it, though, and Elizabeth was surprised with how much that made her sad.

Throughout the years, as old members of the troupe sailed on to the great beyond and new ones took their place, more and more people started to treat her as if she were actually a priest. When they asked her to lead in prayer, she would politely decline, until she saw their confused and pained faces, and then she would humor them with a few kind-sounding but ludicrous words.

So, me hearties, let us raise a glass to Elizabeth, the Priest of mystery and grace. May her tale serve as a reminder that even amidst the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope."
"The wind was soft through the park. A few couples walked hand in hand down the cracked, cement paths strewn throughout the dying grass. The park bench I sat on faced a still pond. The blue waves slowly came onto the shore. I pinched a small piece of bread out from my own brown bag. The small blue birds below chirped at the sight of it. I tossed it down and they went to work, pecking at the crumbs. One hopped onto my shoe, eating from atop my toes. I smiled and kept my leg as still as possible for the little guy. Another couple walked behind my bench, giggling to themselves in their own perfect world. I sighed as they passed. 
 
 `` Lonely forever'' I said kicking my foot up, the bird chirped and moved back to the ground. 
 
 All the birds seemed to look up at me in unison. They completely ignored the crumbs I tossed in return. Their black eyes stared up at me unblinking. Yellow beaks stood still. One flapped up onto my knee cap. 
 
 `` Lonely?'' The bird asked `` But sir, we're here are we not?'' 
 
 I looked at it with wide eyes. No one else around could hear. 
 
 `` Where did you pick up an English accent?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Is it a mate you want?'' They asked ignoring me. 
 
 `` Well I mea-'' 
 
 `` We're the best wing men'' One chirped out from my foot. 
 
 `` Shut up, Harold'' Another spat slapping at Harold with a wing. 
 
 `` It's fine'' The main bird said flying up to meet my eyes `` You in?'' 
 
 `` Sure'' I said, tossing another piece of bread.
"," Adopt the paranoid and speculative language of a conspiracy theorist, questioning everything.","The wind whispers secrets through the park, a melody of whispers carried on the breeze. My gaze roams the park, searching for signs, for breadcrumbs in the wind. I find solace in the simple act of feeding the birds, my brown bag a conduit to a world of unspoken truths.

A symphony of chirping fills the air, a cacophony of voices echoing through the park. I toss a small piece of bread into the air, a offering to the feathered creatures. They descend upon me like a flock of hungry ghosts, pecking at the crumbs, their black eyes gleaming. One landed upon my shoe, a feathered companion perched upon my toes. I smile, my heart filled with an inexplicable joy.

A couple walks behind me, their voices ringing like the chimes of fate. They giggle, their laughter echoing through the park. I sigh, a reflection of the fleeting nature of joy. The wind whips through my hair, carrying with it the scent of secrets and memories.

I kick my foot up, a gesture of defiance against the world's injustices. The birds rise as one, their black eyes locked on me. I feel their presence, their unwavering gaze. One flaps onto my knee cap, its beak sharp as a razor.

""Lonely?"" the bird chirps, its voice dripping with empathy. ""But sir, we're here, are we not?""

I look at the bird with wide eyes, the world around me fading into a blur. No one else can hear, the secrets of the park swirling around me.

""Where did you pick up an English accent?"" I ask, my voice tinged with curiosity.

The bird ignores me, its focus on my hand. ""Is it a mate you want?"" it chirps.

I am at a loss for words. The bird's words echo in my mind, their meaning elusive. I try to speak, but my voice is lost in the wind.

The bird flutters around me, its wings buzzing. ""We're the best wing men,"" one chirps.

""Shut up, Harold,"" another warns, its voice sharp as a knife.

The main bird lands on my lap, its black eyes staring into mine. ""It's fine,"" it chirps. ""You in?""

I hesitate, my mind reeling from the bird's enigmatic words. ""Sure,"" I say, my voice low and subdued. I toss another piece of bread, and the birds swarm around me, their joy a tangible embodiment of life and resilience."
"`` It's a balancing act, you see, Senator.'' I could n't actually understand what he was saying at this point. I heard him, sure, but the smartly dressed man from what he called `` Section'76'' absolutely had to be lying. There was no possible way. 
 
 At least, that's what I thought until I saw them a moment later after being lead through a massive vault door that hissed and clanked as it open. And there they were -- attached to giant turbines that hummed with a mechanical ferocity. 
 
 `` So you see, now, at least?'' the man said. 
 
 `` Oh...'' I had to remember to breathe. `` Quite.'' 
 
 With a grin, the man turned to me, `` You know at the beginning they did n't have enough specific impulse to get them running. We knew we could get them up to almost relativistic speeds, but we had to ramp them up gradually. These machines are so large an expensive that we had to tune them up relatively slowly.'' 
 
 `` So how did you do it?'' 
 
 `` Well it started with Kent state.'' he began, gesturing back through the vault door where we would n't be deafened by the cacophony. 
 
 `` Are you serious?'' 
 
 `` Oh, yes, Senator. We killed those kids.'' 
 
 `` JFK?'' 
 
 `` Yep.'' He winced a little. `` That was definitely pushing the limits.'' He quickly returned to smiling. `` Helped us defeat the Soviets though.'' 
 
 It was hard to stomach. As much as the things they did were awful, there's no way we could have kept the country going without this massive amount of power. But there was still something missing. There's no way they could keep this secret if they told every congressman. 
 
 `` You said something about a balancing act earlier?'' 
 
 The man stopped walking and looked to me. `` So you are starting to understand. Good. Come this way.'' 
 
 We changed directions down a different hall, and eventually came to a door with an unassuming door. He swiped his badge and placed his hand on a biometric scanner. The door clicked and swung open to the inside. He gestured for me to go first. 
 
 Inside the room there was just a table with some snacks and a thermos for coffee with a couch and two comfortable-looking chairs. `` Please, let's sit and talk.'' 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
 
 From the conversation that we had, it turned out that they really did n't have to do much at all. If the people who were making the presidents spin in their graves knew how much they were helping the country, then the presidents would n't spin as much. This, it turned out, was a covert operation -- almost inception as much as it was espionage. 
 
 But there was also damage control as well, the machines could only handle so much spinning before they would have to be disconnected as to not break them. It has only happened twice and it resulted in national power outages. The repercussions of which were not easily dealt with. 
 
 `` So why am I here?'' I finally asked, now knowing the scope of this operation and how delicate it was. 
 
 `` Well, Senator, there's no real easy way to put this.'' He paused for a moment and rubbed what had become a five o'clock shadow. 
 
 `` You're a very up-and coming figure in US politics. Quite influential. Many people like you and your record is spotless. The old men really like what you're doing.'' 
 
 A pit formed in my stomach. The room started to spin. 
 
 `` It's a balancing act, you see? We have enemies, Senator.'' 
 
 Vision gone, sounds muffled... 
 
 `` They must continue to spin... 
 
 I do hope you understand.'' 
 

", Adopt the inventive and optimistic perspective of an early 20th-century inventor.,"The inventor's perspective is filled with a sense of accomplishment and optimism. He believes that his invention has the potential to change the world for the better. Despite the tragic consequences of his creation, he emphasizes its positive impact on the nation.

The inventor's use of vivid imagery and strong language creates a vivid and engaging experience for the reader. The description of the massive turbines humming and the cacophony of the machines is particularly effective. His tone is also conversational and friendly, and he is willing to share his insights and experiences with the reader.

However, the inventor's optimism is juxtaposed with the dark reality of the events he describes. The admission of the tragic loss of children is a sobering reminder of the potential for human error and the devastating consequences of war. The reader is left to grapple with the moral implications of the inventor's actions and the difficult balance he had to make between patriotism and morality.

The inventor's conclusion is both optimistic and introspective. He acknowledges the tragedy of his creation but also emphasizes its positive impact on the nation. His final words are a reflection on the power of invention and the responsibility that comes with it."
"Humanity's solution was space-folding. The problem is that in the folding process, anything along the `` crease'' is annihilated utterly. The most difficult part of the process was mapping an infinite trajectory in opposite directions and seeing to it that nothing of value was along this line. This inevitably led to problems; on one occasion, by chance two foldings intersected, wherein it was discovered that an entire 2D plane of our existence was destroyed. Apparently, major celestial bodies do not like having their continuity interrupted, and this causes them to re-coalesce into separate celestial bodies. The eggheads seem to think this is due to some interruption in some fundamental force of physics being discontinued for an infinitesimally brief but relevant length of time, but most people think they're full of crap and just guessing. 
 
 The other problem is that objects perpendicular to the fold at vast distances from the fold are slammed together along the hyperplane. Imagine two stars being slammed together from opposite ends of the galaxy within the 120-second duration of the folding event... literally impossible speeds. This really pisses off some other species whose nighttime skies are being polluted by intense flashes of light, to say nothing of how miffed the inhabitants of those systems might tend to become... 
 
 As the humans' foldings became more frequent, their territory has become a veritable origamy crane of hyperdimensional confusion. Travel within their territory is inadvisable at this time. Apparently their big thing now is to `` loop'' the fold upon itself, which allows interdimensional travel, but in unpredictable ways. Heaven, Nirvana, Acheron, Blathezuuh, Dave's Dimension, and Gweeguooiton 7 are now spilling into this reality, causing quite a mess. Dave is such an asshole. He stole the Ring Nebula, and is jackassing around wearing the Mexican Hat Galaxy and eating all of the tacos in the known universe. Jerk did n't even offer to pay.

The annihilation of dimensional planes, the violent collisions of objects, and the concomitant disruption of celestial harmony are sobering reminders of the profound impact that this technology has had upon the cosmos."
"As I sat drinking my morning coffee and staring out at another rainy day, I could here the baby stirring over the monitor. I went up and peeked through the door. 
 
 There are no words to describe how it feels to have a child. It is painful and magical all at the same time. There is worry and stress, but so much happiness and love. Everyone has been so excited. She is the first of her generation in our family. Our first child, the first grandchild, the first neice, and everybody loves her so much. 
 
 Only she is n't the first, her brother was here before her, but nobody likes to think about him. He did n't even get to take a breath so he does n't count. He did n't have a birthday, a celebration, he should have started school this year, he will never do that. He will never eat ice cream, or walk across the beach, or drink coffee and watch the rain. Nobody mentions him, nobody thinks about him, nobody even acknowledges he was ever here. 
 
 I wish they did. I wish they mourned him like I do. I wish I could have held him close and told him I loved him. I wish I could have kept him safe. I wish and I wish, over and over again that he were here with me now, watching over his baby sister. 
 
 That's when I felt it, a tugging at my skirt. I looked down to see a small boy with tousled blonde hair and big brown eyes, `` Mummy, can we do a jigsaw while the baby sleeps? ``.
"," Adopt the exhilarating and descriptive style of a globetrotting adventurer, discovering new cultures.","As the rhythmic pitter patter of rain splashed against the window, I sat sipping my morning coffee, my mind wandering back to a distant memory. The faintest whimper of a slumbering baby echoed through the halls, a melody that filled my heart with both joy and bittersweet longing. Peering through the door, I witnessed the precious bundle of joy that had graced the world with her presence.

The arrival of a child is a momentous occasion, a time steeped in both pain and magic. It is a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with worry, stress, and immeasurable happiness. As a parent, one is perpetually inundated with thoughts of protection, while simultaneously grappling with the realization of the fragility of life.

However, my thoughts drifted to a somber memory that cast a long shadow over my joy. My firstborn, a brother, had been stolen from the world far too soon. He was a vibrant soul, brimming with dreams and aspirations that would forever remain unfulfilled. I remember the day he was born, the day the world was dimmed by my grief. It was as if a piece of my heart had been torn away and would forever remain missing.

The absence of my brother is a constant ache that I carry deep within my soul. I wish they would mourn him as I do, express their grief and acknowledge his existence. I long to have held him close, whispered my love into his ear, and kept him safe from the clutches of fate.

But fate had a cruel twist in store for me. As I sat immersed in my thoughts, a tugging at my skirt brought me back to the present. Looking down, I saw my son, his blonde hair tousled, his brown eyes shining. With a smile that spread across his face, he asked, ""Mummy, can we do a jigsaw while the baby sleeps?""

In that moment, the pain of my loss dissipated as I watched my son's joy. The jigsaw puzzle became a symbol of piecing together the shattered fragments of my broken heart. As I worked alongside him, the rain fell softly, and the baby slept soundly, I felt a sense of solace."
"The computer gave a three note chime of discovery, waking Ben from his light doze. He knuckled his eyes, feeling grimy. They ’ d been out for six weeks, nearly double the length of a normal run, but had been having bad luck. Every wreck he ’ d scanned up was tagged, and touching them was against the law. He figured he had enough problems without Galactic police hunting him down, so he ’ d moved on. But every time, his worry sharpened. He had a family to provide for, and a salvager who couldn ’ t find wrecks starved. 
 
 After the tenth time pinging a tagged wreck, he ’ d decided to sweep an asteroid belt. He hated to take the risk, but they were running out of time. He hadn ’ t bothered to wake Jade up from hypersleep and ask her if she minded putting their lives at risk. She would have just shrugged, anyway. 
 
 Ben thought sometimes that God had forgotten to put fear in that woman when He made her. Or any other emotions. The only things she expressed interest in were wrecks, and spending as much time in hypersleep as possible. He had a wife and daughter, and left skipping across time to Jade, who cared for no one. They had been partners for twenty years, and she didn ’ t look a day over twenty-three, while Ben was starting to gray. He had a feeling she would long outlive him. But at least when he ’ d asked her to split their income 70/30, she had just shrugged. 
 
 “ Is it tagged? ” Ben croaked at the computer. 
 
 “ Tag not found. ” 
 
 “ How big is it? ” he asked, excitement beginning to rise. 
 
 “ Artificial matrices scan over 100 kilometers. ” 
 
 “ Tag it now! ” he said joyfully. 
 
 “ Tagging, ” said the computer obediently, but Ben wasn ’ t listening. He was already out of his pilot ’ s chair and pulling himself to the back of the little wrecker. The ship he owned was almost all cargo bay, but he did have all four sleep pods required by law nestled in the corridor to the main airlock. 
 
 He punched in the code sequence for sleep release and waited. If he hadn ’ t been in zero gravity he would have bounced from foot to foot, but instead he fidgeted by pushing himself back and forth between the corridor walls. 
 
 At long last the pod door slid aside, and Jade floated out, her short black hair standing on end. 
 
 “ What ’ ve you got? ” she asked at once. 
 
 “ Big one, ” he said. “ 100km. ” 
 
 She gave a small smile. “ We ’ d better get to work. ” 
 
 ***** 
 
 The wreck wasn ’ t just large, they soon discovered. It was a transport ship hauling platinum, and Ben was a little surprised the company hadn ’ t sent out a recovery team. Salvagers rarely came across such large, valuable finds. Perhaps the shipping route hadn ’ t been received properly, and the ship was badly off course. A good insurance policy or the risk of the asteroid belt may also have made recovery a losing proposition. 
 
 In any case, he was glad they hadn ’ t. A wreck like this came once in a lifetime, and would set them up for years. Jade had been tractoring in neat packs of foam-wrapped titanium for two days, and the hold was nearly full. It would take four trips just to retrieve the cargo, and several more for the ship parts. 
 
 Ben had done two EVAs, searching for the sleep pods. The computer told him it couldn ’ t find any active signals, and he knew that transport ships were often unmanned, but he still always looked. He had found three empty pods, and was suiting up for another EVA to look for the fourth, when Jade opened her mic. 
 
 “ Ben, you should take a look at this. ” 
 
 “ Be right there. ” 
 
 He hooked his helmet to his belt and headed for the cargo bay. His partner was strapped into the tractor control seat outside. Jade was deft with the tractors, able to spin the fine filaments out eight at time without tangling them. She was a worthy partner just for that; Ben could only handle four tractors at once, and preferred EVAs. 
 
 “ It ’ s strange, ” she said, pointing at the screen. All eight filaments were out and pointing at the same object. They looked like snakes poised to strike. 
 
 “ What is that? ” He peered at the screen. 
 
 “ I don ’ t know. I thought it was a piece of the ship, but the tractors won ’ t lock on. ” 
 
 “ Let ’ s get a look at it through one of the tractor cams. ” 
 
 Jade gave the command, and the object appeared on the screen, much bigger, but still indistinct. 
 
 “ I think it ’ s an asteroid, ” she said. “ I ’ ve never seen one that looked like that, though. ” 
 
 Ben agreed. It was the shape of a small asteroid, lumpy and oblong, but it seemed to shine with many colors, and he couldn ’ t quite tell where the edges were. 
 
 “ How big is it? Can we get a better picture? ” 
 
 “ Seems to be about fifty meters across. This is the best the tractors can do. Sorry. ” 
 
 “ I was going out anyway, ” he said. “ I can get a good look at it with the suit cam. ” 
 
 Jade shrugged. “ We ’ ve got plenty here without some weird rock, ” she said. “ Up to you. ” 
 
 But his curiosity was spiked. The asteroid, if that ’ s what it was, was fifty kilometers out, so he locked his suit into the EXO, making sure its thrusters were full. 
 
 Traveling fast was a recipe for death in an asteroid belt, so he kept his speed at ten meters per second. It took him over an hour to near the asteroid. The tractors were long gone, and he knew they would be hard at work elsewhere in the site. 
 
 He used the thrusters to slow his approach, and made sure his suit cam was on. 
 
 “ About there, ” he told Jade. 
 
 “ Copy. ” 
 
 He was close enough to see the colors, and while he examined them they shifted and rippled. 
 
 “ The colors we saw are moving. It might be rotating, can ’ t tell yet. Going to get closer. ” 
 
 “ Copy, ” said Jade dutifully. 
 
 Ben moved in at half a meter per second. When he realized what he was seeing, he stopped breathing. 
 
 “ They ’ re flowers, ” he whispered. 
 
 He swept his gaze over the shining things, struck with wonder. There were no leaves, only petals. The ones nearest him were a deep blue, edged with an electric purple shot with green, the tips hinting at colors no human eye could see. Each flower was a trumpet, with six petals fanned out like lilies. 
 
 “ Say again, ” Jade ’ s voice seemed very far away. 
 
 Ben fixed his eye on a single flower, watching as its blue blossomed into red. Its bell and those of its immediate fellows turned toward him slowly, as if in greeting, then away. 
 
 “ It ’ s an asteroid, all right, ” he said. “ It ’ s growing flowers. ” 
 
 “ Flowers? ” He had never heard Jade sound confused before. 
 
 “ Space lilies, ” he laughed. “ I ’ ve never seen anything like it. How is this possible? ” 
 
 “ Copy. I think you should come in, Ben. ” 
 
 “ I will. ” He reached out and stroked the underside of a petal. It moved with his finger, closing slowly, then returned to its original position. It reopened, undisturbed. 
 
 “ Ben, ” she said, worry in her voice. 
 
 “ It ’ s all right, I ’ m coming. ” Regretfully, he turned away. He was careful not to point his thrusters at the flower colony when he left. 
 
 ***** 
 
 Jade tried to hide how impressed she was with the video he had taken, but he wasn ’ t fooled. She was almost as excited as he was. 
 
 “ Do you know what this means? ” he said. 
 
 “ We send out the beacon for discovery of alien life. ” 
 
 “ And? ” 
 
 “ And it ’ s under our tag. We ’ re going to be extremely wealthy. ” 
 
 Jade smiled. “ You ’ d better go send a message to your wife. You aren ’ t going to be home for a while. ” 
 
 Ben smiled back. “ But when I get there, I get to stay. Say, do you wan na buy a ship? ”
"," Style the text after a Victorian detective story, including intricate plots, deductive reasoning, and a foggy London setting.","The fog shrouded London in an oppressive blanket, obscuring even the most seasoned detective's vision. Ben, a weary salvage officer, found himself grappling with a complex case that had left him sleepless for weeks. A series of misfortunes had driven him to the brink of desperation, but he knew he had to find a solution.

The computer emitted a chime, signaling the discovery of a tagged wreck. With grimy eyes, Ben knuckled his tired lids and began his deductions. He had a knack for seeing patterns others missed, and this case presented a tangled web of intrigue. It was a labyrinth of intricate plots, false leads, and a cast of enigmatic characters.

As he meticulously examined the data, Ben realized that the wreck was colossal, spanning over a hundred kilometers. He knew that tagging such a massive object would be a formidable task, but he was determined to succeed. He raced to his ship, a humble wrecker that was more cargo bay than cockpit, but it had the necessary sleep pods.

With the adrenaline pumping through his veins, Ben punched in the code sequence for sleep release and waited patiently. As he drifted off into slumber, he dreamed of a day when the fog would clear and he could finally find peace.

The next morning, as the sun peeked through the dense fog, Ben awoke with a start. The computer displayed the news he had been waiting for - the wreck was tagged. With a surge of excitement, he began plotting his course to the wreckage. The journey was treacherous, but Ben persevered, driven by the promise of a breakthrough.

Finally, he reached the wreck. It was a sight to behold, a testament to the destructive power of the cosmos. As he meticulously scanned the wreckage, Ben knew that his long hours and sleepless nights had been worth it. He had cracked the case, and the fog began to dissipate around him."
"Terra was always considered the land of misfits. 
 
 The one place in the galaxy where worlds could dump their unnecessary, and unneeded species from their worlds to ours. Each planet of the federation was granted the ability to drop the entirety of one species off onto Terra to free themselves of the burden of their existence on their own world. Terra was considered a *Death World*. As in it could n't sustain life for long periods of time, due to the general entropy of our solar system, and the fact that earth can only handle so much life at once from packing it full of these *useless* species. The Galactic Federation would cause mass extinction events to `` cleanse'' the planet when it got too packed, essentially a cosmic trashbin for the Galactic Federation. 
 
 Humanity really was a luck of the draw. After the last M.E.E. of the Galactic Federation, as we know mammals came to be the dominant type of animal on the planet, eventually giving way to the rise of *Homo Sapiens*. Humans were lucky. One in a trillion, usually the beings of energy who lead the Galactic Federation gift the evolutionary path to sentience, and intelligence to a world, but we were the first who came to be in a natural fashion, quite literally diamond in the rough, the treasure in the world of intergalactic trash. 
 
 And now that we were one of them, 
 
 *The Federation were frightened to see what we could do. *
"," Use the precise and excited tone of an enthusiastic scientist, including technical jargon.","Terra, the enigmatic land of misfits, was an enigmatic celestial refuge where worlds cast off their extraneous and superfluous species. A planet steeped in entropy, it had an uncanny ability to devour life, leaving only devastation in its wake. Each planet of the federation wielded the prerogative to offload the entirety of one species onto Terra, transforming it into a cosmic trashbin. Such mass extinction events, orchestrated by the Galactic Federation, served to cleanse the planet when it became overcrowded.

Humanity, an unwitting beneficiary of cosmic fate, had been blessed with an unparalleled stroke of luck. After the cataclysmic last M.E.E., mammals had triumphed over their rivals, paving the way for the ascendancy of Homo Sapiens. And what a fortuitous occurrence it was for humans to be the first to emerge from the primordial chaos in a natural fashion. Diamond in the rough, the treasure of the cosmos, we were gifted with sentience and intelligence, all while being bestowed with the privilege of inhabiting this enigmatic planet.

The Federation, wary of our burgeoning power, trembled at the thought of our potential. They recognized the threat we posed to their hegemony, and they knew that the balance of power had irrevocably shifted in our favor."
"A scruff stocky man walks towards the table. He turns his broad shoulders sideways to squeeze past other patrons of the tavern. He strokes his beard with his right hand as he eyes his companions sitting around a large oaken table. He unsheaths his ax and slams it down into the table. The barkeep looks up sees the party making the mischief and returns back to serving the other patrons hoping the night will end peacefully. 
 
 `` I just got done talking to my contact in the city guard. It looks to be the same as the other victims.'' says the stocky bearded man eyeing each of his companions in turn as he speaks. `` This I say is no longer a coincidence someone is targeting us for our heroic actions against the crazed cult trying to revive the old god and I think we all know who it is.'' 
 
 One of the companions clad in pristinely shined plate mail armor and a shield with a holy cross etched upon strung across his back bangs his gauntleted fists down upon the table. `` I will not hear this again I will not have his good name spoken ill. He died bravely fighting against the cult and that will be the end of it. Perhaps remenants of the cult still linger and wish revenge upon us for halting their vile ritual.'' 
 
 Another companion wearing a purple hooded robe hiding just enough of his face as to not recognize him and wielding a gnarled oaken staff chimes in `` You are as foolish as you are pious Matthew perhaps members of the cult are still around but none left would be brave enough to stand against us. Besides the attacks were all done when they were at their weakest moment. This was intimate somebody that knows us far too well and wishes us to be exposed. James in the whore house enjoying pleasures of the flesh slain and Sandy lovely Sandy. She was killed while engaging in narcotics trades within this very city. Her ties to the Thieves Guild clearly exposed. No whomever is doing this wishes the legend of our heroic deeds to become undone it has to be him.'' 
 
 `` Well Jamnil'' interrupted Matthew `` You said the deed was done how is it that he continues to haunt us?'' 
 
 `` I know not!'' Shouted Jamnil. The other patrons in the tavern avert their gaze towards the party in the corner a silence fills the tavern for a moment. Then it returns to normal as time passes and Jamnil continues in a softer voice `` I took care of him! He did n't see it coming I sliced him across his chest and the blood splatted upon my face I can feel it even in this moment. His body fell lifeless and tumbled from the bridge of Drathol into the abyss below nobody could have survived that. 
 
 `` Did this victim have the note?'' interrupted the hooded companion 
 
 `` Yes, and it read as it did before, EVERYBODY WILL GET WHATS DUE.'' replied Jamnil 
 
 `` Those were the final words you spoke to him, were n't they Jamnil, when he was asking about his cut of the riches and honors to be bestowed to us'' replied the robed man. 
 
 `` It could n't of possibly been him Ged, Jamnil would n't lie about such an event. Besides the note is vague and any number of people out there could be trying to get their revenge on us for our part. Some people even blame the war on us.'' said Matthew. 
 
 Jamnil reaches into his leather jerkin pulls out a few objects that glitter in the light but are too difficult to make out from a distance. He slides them across the table top. Matthew and Ged look upon them first with disbelief then with horror. 
 
 Matthew picks it up and looks at it closely. `` Are these forgeries?'' 
 
 `` No I've already had them checked out these are the juggling daggers used by that fool jester we kept along with us on our journeys.'' Its him and he does n't just want us gone he wants our history erased. I for one will be sleeping with my ax in hand waiting for when he comes. I suggest you two start sleeping with one eye open.'' said Jamnil scanning the far corners of the bar for any unknown assailants. 
 
 `` I intend to leave this city tonight then I must make haste. I believe not that he still lives but the powers of the undead are very real and there are many preperations that I must make to ward myself from such terrors.'' said Ged hastiliy as he begins gathering up himself and leaving the tavern. 
 
 A loud bang is heard from the other end of the tavern as the heavy oaken door is swung open from the outside streets with great force as to slam it against the wall. The three adventurers gather themselves for an attack as in walks the Jester in question smiling a quirky crooked smile revealing many broken and dirty teeth. `` EVERYBODY WILL GET WHATS DUE.'' Were the only words uttered from the Jester. 
 
 The whispers start in the crowd. `` Thats him'' can be heard `` It ca n't be he died fighting the doomsday cult'' `` Is n't he supposed to be a hero''. The crowd parts to the sides of the tavern clearing a straight path between the heroes and the Jester. Jamnil takes advantage grabs the handle of his axe sunk into the table pulls it up and charges. He lefts forth a mighty yell `` I killed you once I'll kill you again.'' The attack was haphazard and foolish however the many debris left over on the floor made for uneven footing for a charge and the Jester deftly tumbled out of the way of the attack as Jamnils ax came down with a great force cutting through air. Jamnil nearly losing his balance struggles to regain his footing and does say moments too late to block an incoming dagger thrown straight for Jamnils chest. It sticks clean upto the hilt of the blade and Jamnil shocked looks down to see his would. 
 
 The Jester begins to laugh uncontrollably and dance around. Much to the dismay of the two remaning heroes who stand in awe at the strongest of them fallen by a single blade. The jester finally remembering his other two snaps back into the present and approaches Matthew who sinks back into his chair. 
 
 `` It was Gens idea to cut you out. It was his idea since the beginning. We all agreed you'd be the easiest target you were always so unaware of everything going on around you! Please I do n't want to die!'' cried Matthew 
 
 The Jester smiles at Matthew and then smiles at Gen. `` EVERYBODY WILL GET WHATS DUE.'' repeats the Jester as he continues his approach towards the two remaining heroes. 
 
 With a flash of light from the Jesters right hand a series of daggers fly forth after Matthew. Matthew struggles to get his shield around from his back to protect himself from the projectiles. It looks like his life will end in moments as the daggers fly true towards their intended target. Matthew's eye widen in fear and shame but as the daggers are about to make make the killing blow they hit against an invisible shield and fall lifeless to the floor. Gen is grasping his staff with both hands chanting to himself casting a magical barrier around his ally. 
 
 `` EVERYBODY WILL GET WHATS DUE!'' repeats the Jester as he cackles maniacally. As he tumbles to the left and readies another volley of daggers. Matthew has his sword and shield ready and engages the Jester whos daggers thrown are easily deflected by the shield and magic. Matthew readies his sword and engages but the Jester changes tactics and stops throwing daggers but instead wields one in each hand and begins dancing around the tables and tumbling to dodge attacks. With a tumble he comes up dagger in each hand slicing with his left and then again with his right Matthew barely able to dodge or block the continued onslaught of the unhinged madman. Matthew used to being able to at least riposte parry or counter is unable to do anything but dodge or block as hes slowly being pushed back into the corner of the tavern. 
 
 Matthew realizing that being pushed back into the corner will mean his utter defeat begins looking for another way out a change in tactics anything. The continued attacks of the Jester are beyond the talents of the companion he once travelled with. The torment of the sin he has committed has troubled him for many sleepless nights seeing no way out of the current attack he decides to allow his death to pay as retribution for such sins and begins to lower his guard to allow the Jester's attacks to land a fatal blow. 
 
 As Matthew begins preparing himself the eternal void from behind an ax swings down hard upon the Jester. Blood splattering everywhere in the tavern. While they were engaged in battle Ged was busy rushing to Jamnil's aide healing his wounds to prevent him from passing into the void. With enough time passed Jamnil was able to pick up his ax and deliver a killing attack to the Jester. Jamnil leans down and says `` Do you think this proves anything? Life will continue as it always has for us without you around.'' 
 
 The Jester continuing to smile even as death begins to embrace him even as blood covers his body and face says one final phrase `` everybody will get whats due'' as his final breaths are done his lips still smiling even in death lies peacefully on the ground of the tavern. Already the whispers of the patrons that have witnessed this have begun as they see for the first time what the heroes really are for themselves nothing but shams and charlatans the 3 remaining heroes hastily leave the tavern their reputations forever tarnished.
", Use the confident and jargon-heavy language of a Wall Street banker.,"A stern, muscular figure strides confidently towards the table, his broad shoulders straining against the weight of his imposing stature. He meticulously strokes his bristling beard with his right hand as he casts a wary eye over his companions seated around a towering oaken table. He unsheathes his axe with a swift motion, sending a resounding clang against the table, prompting the barkeep to glance up in concern.

""I've just spoken to my contact in the city guard, and it's the same as the other victims,"" the bearded man declares, his voice dripping with authority. ""This is not a coincidence. Someone is targeting us for our heroic deeds against the crazed cult trying to revive the old god. I believe I know who it is.""

One of his companions, clad in gleaming plate mail armor and a shield emblazoned with a holy cross, slams his gauntleted fists down upon the table. ""I will not hear this again. I will not have his good name spoken ill. He died bravely fighting against the cult, and that will be the end of it.""

Another companion, shrouded in mystery wearing a purple hooded robe and wielding a gnarled oaken staff, chimes in. ""You are as foolish as you are pious, Matthew. Perhaps members of the cult are still lurking, but none left would be brave enough to stand against us. Besides, the attacks were all done when they were at their weakest moment. This was intimate. Someone that knows us far too well and wishes us to be exposed. James in the whore house, enjoying pleasures of the flesh, slain. Sandy, lovely Sandy. She was killed while engaging in narcotics trades within this very city. Her ties to the Thieves Guild were clearly exposed.

""Well said, my dear,"" the bearded man nods, his voice dripping with satisfaction. ""We have unmasked the villain. Now, let us raise a glass to our fallen comrades and continue our celebration."""
"When did I fall in love with her? As we eat our dinner I ca n't help but gaze into her eyes. She looks back at me with the same loving gaze she always has. I never get tired of looking at her, her skin smooth as plastic. Her eyes reflected the chandelier and gave off a twinkle, this is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. As I dig into the wonderful soup she made for me, I think back onto how we first met. I saw her online and knew immediately, there could not be a life without her. Without a second thought my mouse hit the purchase option and the window flashed, two weeks expected delivery. It had to be the hardest two weeks any man had to endure in their life. When the time came I was watching out my window, like a child waiting on Santa. The UPS truck pulled up and the carrier produced a medium sized box from his truck. I could n't wait any longer and ran to meet him half way. This was it my queen, my life, my everything. As I ran inside I opened the box and there she was smiling back at me. At that moment I knew everything had changed for the better.

"My whole life I ’ ve focused on becoming a tennis player. I would cut class before competitions, just to practice more. I would wake up freezing in the middle of winter, hours before anyone else, and swing my racket just to perfect my strokes. I became the best tennis player in my town, I dominated recreational and high school leagues of all age brackets up until I graduated. My grades suffered, but being number one in the state for my age group secured me a scholarship. Many people were counting on me to dominate at tennis in college, to spread our school ’ s reputation. I was thirsty for more challenges. I wanted to get better, playing for over a decade at that point only fueled my passion further. 
 
 But then I met Sandra freshman year of college. And we fucked. A lot. And it was fun. But it was a distraction. 
 
 Tennis had been my reason for living, my lover, parent and friend for many years. I ’ d only known Sandra for two months and she was starting to get clingy, taking more from me then she could give. So I broke up with Sandra because tennis was more important. To be fair, I had told her when she elevated my status from fuck buddy to boyfriend that tennis was the most important thing in my life, and it was going to stay that way no matter what. After we broke up, I ignored all of her phone calls and avoided her completely after about a month had passed. 
 
 I remember preparing to go into an important qualifier match when my cellphone rang. 
 
 “ Wait. What? ” 
 
 “ I ’ m going into labor Charlie ” 
 
 I remember getting really nervous because she said it like it was supposed to matter to me. Sweat stained my palms and made the cellphone gross in my hand. 
 
 I could feel dirt in the cracks of my palm, sticking to my skin. 
 
 “ Why are you telling me this, I told you we were over. ” 
 
 She exhaled sharply, annoyed. 
 
 I started to get angry and yelled into the phone, “ Sandra this better not be some manipulative ploy to make me talk to you. We already worked it out, we met up like three times since we broke up to talk. I ’ m sorry you got yourself knocked up, but I ’ m busy at the moment and can ’ t talk to you ”. 
 
 I got really worked up, I was already pumped since my match was starting soon. She started sobbing on the other end of the line, big blubbery whistles like a dog crying. 
 
 “ It ’ s yours Charlie, the baby is yours. ” 
 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 10 years later. 
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 
 
 So my life had not been my own for a while now. I had considered killing myself, since I couldn ’ t play tennis and be a father at the same time. I wanted a family, but not until I had achieved my dream and Sandra took that away from me. 
 
 This went through my mind as I sat across from her in the living room of our shitty four room house that we were renting. Saturday was my only day off from the double shifts that I worked the other six days. Years ago I was able to still play tennis, but getting old sucks. Now any free time I had went to resting, so I can perform menial labor and feed my kids. Yes kids, we had another one because “ Charlie Jr. needs a playmate Charlie! HE NEEDS the social stimulation, you aren ’ t around enough to hang out with him and- “, at that point I had walked out of the room, so who the fuck knows what else she said. 
 
 I glared at her, reading her fucking novella. Sitting in the couch I had paid for, in the clothes that I had paid for. 
 
 I heard the backdoor slam and a set of feet running, pounding against the linoleum of the kitchen and then pounding on wood floors as Charlie Jr. and Timmy ran through the living room. Before rounding the bend and continuing out the backdoor of the house, Timmy accidentally knocked over the small table stand that I had been resting my beer on. It spilled on to the carpet. 
 
 I reached out to grab him by the collar, but the little scoundrel ducked, stuck out his tongue and followed his brother into the yard. I was too tired to really do anything. I yelled at Sandra to clean it up and she just ignored me. The beer soaked into the carpet and was forgotten, like the other stains and marks around the house that never got cleaned. 
 
 They all just ignored me. 
 
 But you know who didn ’ t ignore me, the friends and fans I had made playing tennis. God, how much I missed the game. I didn ’ t realize what was happening inside me, the terrible agony slowly morphing into sociopathic tendencies. I was held back only by cultural norms, fear of punishment, but most of all, a sense of responsibility to my kids. 
 
 That was my analysis though when I was still sane. Last month things changed. It was a Saturday where I had the living room to myself. My eyes were glued to the television as I distracted myself from life. There was a report about some kind of nerve stimulant that did something to something and then something about rhino virus carrying something, something. I was drunk and thought it was a joke. In my stupor I passed out on the couch. 
 
 I heard laughing and my eyes popped open. The living room was dark, neon numbers across the room showed the time to be 3:20 AM. I heard pounding on the wooden floors. A set of feet. 
 
 Fear set in, I thought it was a robber. I quickly rose and flipped the light switch. It was my kids, they were chasing each other with toy guns in there hand. 
 
 “ Why are you guys up! ” I yelled. They both froze, I had never been that loud before. But it had also been a while since I ’ d been this angry. I had to be at work in a few hours and they had interrupted my sleep. 
 
 I heard Sandra upstairs getting off our bed. The floorboards creaked as she descended the stairs. 
 
 “ Well. Answer Me. ” 
 
 “ We can ’ t sleep dad ” they said in unison. 
 
 Sandra appeared behind me. She brushed past me, taking both boys by the hands. 
 
 “ Come on guys, dad is trying to sleep. ” She led them away. I went back to bed and then went to work a few hours later. 
 
 They stopped sleeping, every single night the kids would wake us. My coworkers complained about their kids. The schools started to change. Adults started to change. Kids are the future and we need to accommodate them. If this is how mankind is supposed to evolve, so be it. That ’ s what everyone said. Everyone agreed. Scientists couldn ’ t reverse whatever the common cold now did to kids that made them never have to sleep again. They seemed to function normally; they just never needed to sleep to do so. 
 
 The first tragedy as a result of this phenomenon was the massive loss of jobs as every industry and product associated with sleep began to shrink. With no more new customers, the next generation won ’ t even know what a mattress was. 
 
 The second tragedy was the ritual I had to perform so I can become young again. I had to become the tennis star I was meant to be. 
 
 After the third week of sleeping less than an hour my young self started to whisper in my ear. My kids screaming all day and night, them needing more attention, food, water and entertainment while the rest of us went on needing sleep. It was impossible to keep living, until Charlie told me it was okay, “ you don ’ t need sleep either, you just need me Charlie ”. 
 
 I had stopped talking to my family, since they just ignored me anyway, and started carrying on conversations with the old me. I shared fond memories of being on the court and felt so much nostalgia that the jarring pain became freeing. And I knew I needed more pain to free myself completely. 
 
 One night, after Sandra fell asleep, I went into the garage and downed an entire bottle of tequila. This was the prerequisite for the ritual, I could hear my younger self more clearly when I was intoxicated. When his whispers were just behind my ear, crystal clear, I began to do what he told me. 
 
 I shaved my whole body and then took a long, hot shower. After I was clean and slick, I got my old tennis racket and cleaned the dirt off of it as well until it shined like it did in the old days. As I came out of the garage, I went into the kitchen for a pair of scissors and cut the racket ’ s interwoven threads until it resembled a noose with its now empty face. Cupping my ear, I heard my kids laughing in the living room. Following their laughter, I found them sitting on the floor playing with blocks. With their backs turned to me I bludgeoned them to death using the side of the racket and then proceeded to go find my wife upstairs.
"," Write with the cunning and secretive style of a Prohibition-era bootlegger, evading the law.","My life has been a symphony of sweat and determination, a melody of backhand smashes and broken hearts. I've been a tennis prodigy, a champion in the making, but fate had a cruel twist in store for me. It began with a distraction, a fiery flame that ignited my passion and burned brighter than any serve or backhand.

Sandra, a siren in a dress, ensnared me in her web of desire. I had been on a journey, a pilgrimage, to reach the pinnacle of my game, but her allure proved to be too tempting. The court, my sanctuary, was forsaken as I indulged in her embrace, my dreams shattered like a racquet against a wall.

But I am not one to be defeated. I found solace in my renewed focus, the scent of victory clinging to my nostrils. I returned to the court, my strokes more powerful than ever, my mind sharp as a razor. I was reborn, a champion in the making, ready to reclaim my glory.

The phone rang, my heart skipping a beat. It was Sandra, her voice dripping like honeyed words on a silver spoon. I felt the sweat beading on my forehead, the dirt beneath my fingernails, a testament to my determination.

I answered, my anger bubbling over. ""Why are you telling me this, I told you we were over. This is not some manipulative ploy to make me talk to you.""

Her annoyance was evident in her sigh. ""Charlie, you're being a drama queen. You need to calm down.""

I was at a loss for words. I had been through too much to let her words wound me. I hung up, my anger fading like the scent of a rose in the wind.

I stood on the court, my mind clear, my body poised to deliver a shot that would send the crowd erupting into a frenzy. It was my moment, my chance to shine, to prove that I was not a man consumed by his own desires but a champion forged in the fire of adversity."
"It had been just another night, Jack remembered. He had a particularly good time playing Dota 2 with several friends he met recently through the game. Shutting off his computer, he stood up, tired from a long day, to perform his usual bedtime routine. 
 
 Looking in the mirror while brushing his teeth, he could n't help but think about how he had been a disappointment. How he lost his only girlfriend and prospective wife to drugs and lies. He had been sober for a year now, but it did n't make him feel any more alive. He stood there, toothbrush unmoving in his mouth, lamenting his nonexistent social life and lack of female interaction. `` If only I could meet a nice girl somewhere, I'd be doing alright'' he thought. 
 
 His work consumed him, and he knew it. Working for an oil company had him traveling to remote places for long periods of time, and tonight was a rare evening home in his cozy apartment on the outskirts of Denver. He was excited to get a good rest in a nice, comfortable bed, instead of a lumpy monstrosity he is accustomed to finding in various hotels in small towns across the midwest. 
 
 As he is checking his front door to make sure it is locked, he notices his hallway light flicker. A thought graces his mind about a lazy repairman before the light grows increasingly bright then bursts in a surprisingly loud BANG. Intrigued, Jack decided to investigate the unusual occurrence. 
 
 Walking outside, he finds himself shivering uncomfortably, despite the 80 degree summer night temperature. Looking around, he sees nothing unusual, save for the broken lightbulb flashing on and off several times per second. He made a note to report it to the front desk the next morning. 
 
 Maybe it was because it was dark, or maybe it was because Jack was exhausted, but he did not see the dark shape approaching from his peripheral until it was too late. All he noticed was a sharp, stifling smell in the air before he lost consciousness. 
 
 Jack awoke to find himself laying in his bed, waking just before his alarm signaled it was time for him to return to his busy life as an employee for a large company. As he walked out of his apartment long before the sun would rise, he could n't shake the thought that the hallway light bulb was broken the night before.
"," Use the language and phrases of an old-time sailor, including nautical terms and a sense of adventure.","Avast ye, me hearties, for I've a tale to spin of a night that be filled with both despair and mystery. It be a tale of a sailor named Jack, whose life be as turbulent as the waves themselves.

The night be just as black as a storm cloud, and the wind howled like a banshee. Jack, a man of boundless energy and unwavering determination, was hunkered down in his cozy apartment on the outskirts of Denver. But alas, fate be cruel, and his night be filled with sorrow.

As he stared at his reflection in the mirror, he couldn't help but feel like a disappointment. His once-promising relationship with his beloved had been shattered by drugs and deceit, leaving him with nothing but heartache and longing. Despite his sobriety, he felt as if his life was lacking purpose. The only sound in his head was the lament of his nonexistent social life and his inability to find solace in the arms of a woman.

But even amidst his despair, Jack found solace in his work. He traveled to remote places with his oil company, and tonight, he was grateful for the comfort of his own bed. As he checked his front door, a mysterious flicker in the hallway light caught his eye. Intrigued, he ventured outside, shivering uncomfortably in the night air.

Looking around, he saw nothing amiss save for the broken lightbulb that danced on and off like a drunken sailor's flag. He made a mental note to report it the next day, and as he turned to leave, a sharp, stifling smell filled his senses, sending him reeling.

In a flash, darkness consumed him, and he lost consciousness. When he woke, he found himself laying in a pool of his own sweat, the smell of burning rubber and gasoline lingering in his nose. The mystery of that night remained unsolved, leaving Jack with a sense of dread and uncertainty."
