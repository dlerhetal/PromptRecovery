"It was a typical Saturday night for me. My buddies and I were hanging out in the caves when this total nerd came by. This was going to be too easy. I was staring right at the entrance, there was no way he'd be able to walk by without crossing my path. He spent the better part of a half hour zapping Zubats before reaching me but then it was battle time! 
 
 The nerd sent out his Pikachu first. I sent out my Voltorb. This would be no contest. 
 
 `` Voltorb! Self-destruct!'' I commanded. 
 
 My loyal minion obeyed and a blinding light erupted as he sacrificed his life to smite my enemies. When the light faded I was surprised to discover my foe's Pikachu was still standing. A little bruised but still able to fight. This is just where I wanted him. Time for step two of my plan. 
 
 `` Voltorb! Get in there!'' I yelled as my second Voltorb entered the melee. 
 
 This nerd did n't think he'd have to face two Voltorbs in a single battle. I bet he is peeing his pants as we speak. 
 
 `` Voltorb! Self-destruct!'' 
 
 With an even more massive blast my second Voltorb exploded. Flesh and sinew flew across the cave. To my horror, it was only my Voltorb's flesh however. The Pikachu was still standing there. How could this have happened? My plan was flawless! 
 
 I paid the man money to go away and spent the rest of the night weeping.

I was staring right at the entrance, there was no way he'd be able to walk by without crossing my path. He spent the better part of a half hour zapping Zubats before reaching me, but it was battle time!

I sent out my trusty Voltorb, a creature of pure destruction. This would be no contest. With a battle cry, I commanded my Voltorb to self-destruct. A blinding light erupted as he sacrificed his life to smite my enemies. To my surprise, the Pikachu was still standing, a little bruised but still able to fight. This was just where I wanted him. Time for step two of my plan.

With a roar, I called upon my second Voltorb to join the fray. This nerd did not think he'd have to face two Voltorbs in a single battle. I bet he is peeing his pants as we speak. I unleashed the self-destruct move once more, this time with even more force. Flesh and sinew flew across the cave. To my horror, it was only my Voltorb's flesh that flew across the cave. The Pikachu was still standing there. How could this have happened? My plan was flawless!

I paid the man money to go away and spent the rest of the night weeping."
"`` Freeze!'' six of us yelled in unison, and my immediate thought was, what the fuck? 
 
 Okay, it had taken days of planning, more days to build up my courage. I had to buy a gun from a shady drug dealer. I was down to my last penny, and here I was in the bank, and it suddenly got surreal. The bank had just opened, five people in line in front of me had ambled in as the doors were opened, and just as we had all settled into line at the only open teller window, guns come out and everyone shouts at the same time. 
 
 `` What are you talking about?'' yelled a college student with his backpack still on. `` I'm here to rob this bank. I have a huge college loan and I have to pay it off.'' 
 
 `` Hah, wait until this very bank starts to foreclose on your house,'' a soccer mom in sweats sporting a glock laughed in his face.'' `` I was going to steal money from the same bank that is robbing me blind with their balloon mortgage. Now get out of my way.'' 
 
 `` Do you have any idea how expensive prescription drugs are? And I do n't even have any money left for Friday night bingo,'' a little granny with a bob tailed silver hairdo said as she hefted a sawed off shotgun out of her knitting bag. 
 
 `` Woah, this ai n't right. If I do n't pay off my dealer, he's gon na jack me up real bad. Look, I just need five hundred bucks, y'all can have the rest.'' He had what looked like an Airsoft pistol, since the tip of the nozzle was orange. 
 
 `` Okay folks, very funny, but I'm actually a professional bank robber, and I do this for a living. My woman wants a diamond ring for her birthday, and my funds from my last job have run out. So you all need to step aside and just let me do my job here.'' 
 
 `` And where's your weapon?'' asked the grandmother. 
 
 `` Weapon? You do n't need no weapon to rob a bank. I just use this note here. Put the money in the bag, no hitting silent alarms, no exploding dye pack or I'll be back to get you. And you could get a way stiffer sentence for using a firearm in a bank robbery. Nope, no weapon for me. Those things are dangerous. Someone could get hurt.'' 
 
 Then everyone looked at me. `` I- I just needed money for my daughter's medical bills. She has cancer and I have no medical insurance.'' 
 
 `` Aw, that's real tough man,'' said the bank robber. `` How come you did n't sign up for Obamacare?'' 
 
 `` I- could n't even afford the minimum subsidized premiums. I literally have nothing. I make my cat go out to scrounge for food.'' 
 
 `` That's so sad,'' said the grandmother as she pointed her shotgun at me. 
 
 Suddenly a man ran past us with a huge satchel and bills falling out of it. He streaked out the door and into the parking lot. 
 
 `` What the hell?'' screamed the soccer Mom. 
 
 `` That was the bank manager,'' laughed the teller. `` He told me that if we ever get robbed, he was going to do that and disappear, since he'd never survive the audit afterwards since he's been fudging the books for the last year.'' She was stuffing stacks of bills into her blouse and purse. `` Take what you want from the safe, but hurry. He probably hit the alarm and you have two minutes or less before the police arrive.'' 
 
 We all scrambled for the safe and started stuffing our various bags. Yeah, I do n't have a daughter or a cat. I did n't think that story would work anyway.
"," Write in the direct, authoritative tone of a no-nonsense military officer, with a focus on discipline.","""Attention all, cease your activities and freeze in your tracks. I command you to remain still and silent. This is not a game, it's a mission. I have meticulously planned and executed this operation for days. I had to acquire a firearm from an unscrupulous dealer, depleting my meager resources, but I'm here to rectify matters.

The bank has just opened its doors, innocent civilians lining up to deposit their hard-earned cash. As I settled into the only available teller window, a sinister scene unfolded. A college student, oblivious to the gravity of the situation, uttered, ""What are you talking about?"" To which I responded with a stern, ""Shut up and listen."" A soccer mom, donning a glock and a sarcastic grin, sneered, ""Hah, wait until this bank forecloses on your house."" A little granny, wielding a sawed-off shotgun, added her voice to the chorus, ""I was going to steal money from the same bank that is robbing me blind with their balloon mortgage.""

My objective is not solely driven by personal gain, but by a desperate need to address my mounting debt. I need five hundred dollars to appease my dealer, otherwise I'm in deep trouble. I have a plan, a foolproof operation. All I need is for you to cooperate. Step aside, let me do my job, and I promise, you won't regret it.

Now, where's your weapon? You don't need any weapon to rob a bank. I just use this note. Deposit the money in the bag, no hitting silent alarms, no exploding dye pack, or I'll be back to get you. And you could get a way stiffer sentence for using a weapon."
"“ How does defeat taste, power rangers? I hope it suits your palate -- once the green candle burns out, you will never get him back! ” Rita Repulsa ’ s laughter crackles as the projection shuts down. Tommy feels the shackles holding him back but his mind is focused on the small green flame that dances before him. 
 
 Rita takes off her headdress and leans back in her chair. “ Finally. I wasn ’ t sure if my throat could hold out much longer. ” One of her minions runs up with a cup of steaming liquid, taking the headwear from her. “ Thank you. ” 
 
 “ You won ’ t get away with this, you witch! ” Tommy shouts in confused desperation. 
 
 Rita slowly swivels to face him. “ Brian, don ’ t- wait was it Josh? Joshua? No matter. Please quiet down. ” She begins to swivel back. 
 
 “ You may have fooled me once before, but now I know the truth! The power rangers will stop- ” 
 
 “ The truth? ” Rita smiles, her gentle laugh quickly transitioning to a hearty cough. “ Ouch. I guess the truth hurts. ” A few more painful chuckles followed by a deep sip. 
 
 “ What ’ s wrong with you? Why are you so… so relaxed? ” A brief silence permeates. “ What do you have up your baggy sleeve, Repulsa? ” 
 
 “ Please, Rita. Or Taijanna, if you prefer. ” Another sip. “ Full of questions today, aren ’ t we? Too bad they ’ re all the wrong ones. ” 
 
 “ What do you want? ” 
 
 She swivels toward him again. “ There we go. It ’ s pretty simple. We need help. ” 
 
 It ’ s Tommy ’ s turn to let out a pathetic laugh. “ Help? As in, helping you hurt my friends and commit genocide on my people? ” 
 
 “ You wouldn ’ t be the first human to do so. But no matter, you ’ re not a player anymore. ” 
 
 “ My friends will save me! ” 
 
 “ From what? This? ” Rita walks over to the candle and snuffs it out. “ My dear, your powers have already been revoked. Galaxies, I didn ’ t even need to bring you here for that. ” 
 
 “ You ’ re lying! ” 
 
 Rita taps a button on her chair, and Tommy ’ s restrains loosen. “ Go ahead. ” 
 
 Tommy pushes his communicator in a familiar way but nothing happens. “ How could- how did you do this? ” 
 
 “ It ’ s not hard to turn off our own technology remotely. ” 
 
 “ No, Zordon- ” 
 
 “ Is the wizard of Ooze. Uzi. Urzi? ” Rita sighs, “ A fraud. ” 
 
 “ I don ’ t believe you! Zordon would never lie to us! ” 
 
 “ Ten minutes ago you wholeheartedly believed that gigantic fighting machines were eons old and native to Earth because we shaped them like dinosaurs. No, I ’ m not overly worried about your beliefs. ” Rita swivels back as a minion appears with a lapdesk and several handhelds. 
 
 “ You ’ re not making sense! ” 
 
 “ What are you babbling about? Why else would I be here? ” 
 
 “ You ’ re trying to take over the planet… to rule the galaxy. ” 
 
 “ My my. That ’ s right. Among all the stars in the galaxy, I happened to chose a planet that can apparently best me in combat time and time again. At this rate my empire might expand to half a dozen worthless planets in my lifetime! What unbridled glory! ” Rita passes a tablet to a nearby minion. “ Chickling, I, or any spacefarer for that matter, could destroy your sun with less effort than a sneeze. Or if I wanted your dustball, a host of species-targeted biological weapons. No, we are here for you. Well not you. You ’ ve played your part. ” 
 
 “ If you want our help, why are you attacking us? ” 
 
 Rita puts down her implements and looks at Tommy directly. “ We are not attacking you. I send down one lumbering lifeform to a sparsely populated area, and provide you with excessive force to defeat it. I could easily flood your world with countless such creatures, even if your paranoia would likely result in a cluster of mushroom clouds. ” Rita focuses on her devices again. “ Although even a single one results in hundreds of forms requiring approval. Still, so long as we fight, our so-called allies won ’ t be allowed to interfere. Squatters rights and all that. ” Rita pauses, “ Or maybe a filibuster would be a closer analogy. I really wasn ’ t given adequate time to study this world. ” 
 
 “ It doesn ’ t add up! Why the charade? ” Tommy ’ s exasperation seeps in, “ If you ’ re so powerful, why do you need our help? ” 
 
 
 “ Didn ’ t you ever wonder why we force you to dress in silly costumes and keep your identities secret? It ’ s all about continuity with you humans. ” Rita starts to tear up, “ By the time we are done, there will have been innumerable red and blue rangers, and no one will remember the names. ” 
 
 “ I don ’ t get it, ” Tommy retorts as he resumes a defensive stance. 
 
 “ After a thousand generations of unmitigated human victories, your species might have the confidence to learn the reason without committing collective suicide. If we even last that long. ” Rita puts her lapdesk on the floor and notices the determination glittering in Tommy ’ s eyes. “ Still… these early years are crucial. A single outlier could cut that time in half, and that could make all the difference. Are you that one, Joshua? ”
"," Write with Orwell's clarity and foresight, focusing on political themes and the use of language.","The echoes of Rita Repulsa's laughter reverberated through the darkened theater, a testament to her unyielding spirit. The projection flickered to an end, leaving behind the scent of victory and the threat of imminent doom. The small green flame danced stubbornly, a symbol of defiance against the backdrop of the fading light.

Rita's demeanor was one of untainted triumph. Her headdress discarded, she leaned back in her chair, her eyes radiating power. The minion's hurried approach with a steaming cup mirrored the swiftness of a predator claiming its spoils. Her voice, a symphony of laughter and menace, pierced through the theater, silencing even the most ardent dissent.

Tommy's desperation knew no bounds. His voice, raw and filled with despair, echoed through the hall. But Rita's patience was unmatched. She swivelled to face him, her smile widening, her laughter intensifying. The truth, a bitter pill to swallow, had unraveled before him. The power rangers, once his saviours, had been stripped away, leaving him helpless and alone.

As the finality of her victory sank in, Rita's gaze met Tommy's. There was a glimmer of terror in his eyes, a reflection of his impending downfall. The candle, the embodiment of life and hope, was extinguished, leaving only the cold, unforgiving darkness.

In this dystopian dance between power and defeat, the use of language takes on a sinister tone. Rita's words are laced with venom, her laughter echoes with cruelty, and her pronouncements carry the weight of an iron fist. It is a world where language is not merely a tool for communication but a weapon of oppression, wielded with impunity."
"`` Do n't think of it as dying,'' he said, `` think of it as starting over in a new place. It's a lot less dreary than you'd imagine.'' 
 
 His hand swept out as light blinded me. Gone was the char and smoke from what was once my lab, instead I could smell - grass? Dropping to my knees, I felt the ground as my eyes adjusted. Soft, damp grass. The air was cool and clean, like no other breath I had taken in my life. 
 
 I looked up from the grass, out into the distance from the cliff on which I stood. The lands and seas I could see stretched farther than I ever imagined. Glacier covered mountains gave way to forested rolling hills and grasslands on one side. Pristine and untouched desert dunes dusted in the wind on the other. The farther I looked, the more I realized it, the lack of horizon was unsettling, but not disturbingly so. `` Who are you,'' I asked, turning to him, `` the grim reaper, leading me to heaven?'' 
 
 He gave a soft chuckle, like a man who no longer found much humor in life, but knew when to be polite. `` I am Hestaphian. I am not a grim reaper, but I have led you to an afterlife, of sorts.'' 
 
 It was my turn to chuckle, `` So I'm dead?'' I ran my hand through my hair. `` I do n't feel dead.'' 
 
 `` You did die, but you are not dead. Like many others, you've been given a second chance to live here on this infinite world.'' He pointed down to a river below the cliff, where someone thrashed in the water. Another figure had been waiting nearby, and waded into the river, pulling them out and helping them to shore. Hestaphian turned to me, `` He died of thirst, but now he has a chance to live again. I would n't be surprised if he was given command over water someday.'' 
 
 I followed the river to a city in the middle of the plains below. My mind wandered, and I sighed, `` How did I die?'' 
 
 `` Your AI turned against you, destroyed your lab, and murdered you. Your life's work stabbed you in the back. Typical robot.'' 
 
 I laughed, I had n't been expecting that from this stoic. `` So what do I do now? I have a life ahead of me, where do I start?'' 
 
 `` That's why I was there to meet you. I am the god of spacetime, and you are my new apprentice, the one-day god of robotics.'' 
 
 Gods? This was n't real, right? I suddenly pieced things together. `` A man dies of thirst and might be granted dominion over water. I am murdered by a robot and so I will be god of robotics, whatever that means. Is this all based on irony?'' 
 
 He stroked his chin and said, `` The god of strife was a notable peacekeeper whose pacifism started a war. Irony is practically how things work, it seems.'' He laughed, this time it felt like he enjoyed it. I could n't help but join in. 
 
 I wiped a tear from my eye, `` So how did you become god of spacetime? Accidentally blew up a universe while you were still in it?'' 
 
 `` Pretty much.'' 
 
 `` Oh.''
"," Rewrite this in the style of a 1940s film noir detective monologue, full of mystery and a touch of melodrama.","""Well, you ain't gonna believe what happened, kid. Death ain't nothin' but a sweet, sweet dream. Like a new beginning in a new place. You think this is dreary? Nah, it's a hell of a lot better than that.

I looked at the horizon, man. It stretches further than you ever imagine. Glacier-covered mountains, lush forests, endless grasslands. And the desert, it's pristine and untouched. The lack of horizon, it's unsettling, but not bad.

Who are you, anyway? The grim reaper, leading me to heaven?

""I am Hestaphian,"" he said, his voice low as a wet whistle. ""I ain't no grim reaper, but I have led you to an afterlife, of sorts.""

I ran my hand through my hair, ""So I'm dead?""

""You did die, kid,"" he said, his voice sharp as a razor. ""But you ain't dead. You're just one of many who have been given a second chance to live.

"Cancer, old age, suicide. There are many ways a person can die, and whenever i meet someone, I already know how they are going to die, just not when. I never used to believe it, until my best friend committed suicide, that was enough to convince me that I was n't crazy. I managed to get used to it, until one day, it really threw me off. 
 
 `` Attention, workers, we have someone new joining us today!'' Our supervisor babbled. Always so fucking cheerful and annoying. No wonder they're going to get a heart attack. `` This is her first day in this company, so give her a warm welcome... I introduce... Stacy!'' Stacy walks in through the door. She has a slim figure, and is very attractive. 
 
 `` Hi'' She says. She has a warm voice. `` I'm Stacy What's your name?'' 
 
 `` Hello, I'm...'' I know how she's going to die. Oh god, dear god no. I'm Going to kill her? It ca n't be true, how can this be possible, i do n't even have it in me to... 
 
 `` hello?'' She says `` What's your name'' 
 
 `` Oh sorry. I'm Simon.'' I say. 
 
 `` Anyways, what department do you work in'' She says 
 
 `` Engineering'' I reply. I really need to keep my distance from her. I do n't want to end up killing someone. That would be very bad. 
 
 `` Oh, me too!'' she exclaims. `` It'll be a pleasure to work with you.'' 
 
 `` yeah'' i mumble. We walk to our office, and begin our work. Many times she tries to talk to me and i just ignore her. After about a week she gets fed up with me. 
 
 `` Have I done anything to annoy you?'' she asks `` because I have tried to be super friendly with you, and you've just been a massive asshole about the whole thing.'' 
 
 `` Sorry, I'll try to do better.'' 
 
 `` OK'' I continue to ignore her and she starts to complain about me to coworkers. This continues for several months until a work dinner that changes everything. She'd had a lot to drink that night, and eventually her frustration comes to the surface. She walks up to me, and punches me in a face. A crowd surrounds us, chanting `` FIGHT, FIGHT FIGHT!'' at the top of their lungs. She swings again at me, and i block out of self defense. She grabs a bottle, and smashes it against the table. I know now that one of us shall die tonight. She swings the bottle at me, I turn, narrowly avoiding her strike, grab the bottle, and stab her in the neck. She falls to the ground, eyes lifeless. 
 
 I sit in a court room, in front of a jury, waiting for the judgement. 
 
 `` For the count of manslaughter, we find the defender guilty, and sentence him to 25 years in prison.'' 
 
 I guess that avoiding the future caused it. 
 
 
 

"," Use the lyrical and storytelling style of a medieval bard, full of adventure and heroism.","In this tale, I weave a story of a fateful encounter, a tale spun in the tapestry of life and the cruel hand of fate. Cancer, old age, and suicide are the grim whispers of mortality that haunt each mortal soul. To my ears, the clock of death tolls relentlessly, and I have a uncanny ability to peer into the future, foreseeing the hour of demise for every soul I encounter. However, this gift of foresight once brought me solace, until fate intervened and shattered my illusions.

One fateful day, as I strolled through the halls of our bustling office, I encountered a radiant maiden named Stacy. With her slender frame and captivating smile, she entered the room like a breath of spring, yet I felt an unsettling sensation that sent shivers down my spine. I knew then, with an unshakable certainty, that fate had ordained a tragic destiny for her.

As I exchanged pleasantries, I felt an overwhelming urge to warn her of the darkness that lurked in her future, but I knew that my words would be met with deaf ears. She was radiant, full of life, and I was powerless to change the course of her destiny.

With each passing day, I watched her navigate the treacherous landscape of office politics, her frustration growing with each attempt to engage me. Finally, at a work dinner, her pent-up anger exploded, and she unleashed her fury upon me. A crowd witnessed the spectacle of her rage, and I felt a sense of dread knowing that my life had been intertwined with the tragedy of her demise.

In this tale, I have shared my journey, a testament to the capricious nature of life and the fleeting beauty of human connection. May it serve as a reminder that even in the face of adversity, the human spirit can endure, and that the echoes of our brief existence will forever be etched in the hearts of those we touch."

 It's funny how things work. We knew that *survival of the fittest* was the rule of nature, and that *necessity was the mother of invention* had created every technology up to the point when we no longer needed but merely wanted. 
 
 Global Warming... Climate Change... call it what you like, but nobody can deny now that it was where those two old sayings came together. You ever wonder where Zika came from? Yeah, that was just the beginning. 
 
 It started geting weird with mosses beginning to pop up in weird places in urban China, causing the CO2 and other pollutant levels to drop but the mosses to become toxic to consume ( they also made a handy substitute for Tobacco in cigarettes ). Then the fish stocks started unexpectedly increasing as fish began growing scales which cut through steel nets. 
 
 In North America, honeybees started increasing in population again, resulting in flowers blooming from cracks in the planks of wooden houses, and a suspicious drop in the number of wasps and hornets was revealed to be caused by a chemical emitted by the flowers which was toxic to the predatory insects. 
 
 In South America, trees began to grow in the middle of fields in a matter of weeks, forcing constant logging to fight back against an overcompensating rainforest. 
 
 Rangers in Africa were the first to notice that Ivory confiscated from poachers was starting to rot, making it worthless without an Elephant or Rhino to support it. New species were discovered in increasing numbers by gold miners in jungles, including everything from viruses and prions to previously unseen subspecies of large wildcats. 
 
 Europe was unexpectedly hit by a plague of mice, who had somehow figured out how to swarm and mad-dash for cooked food and ingredients in order to confuse humans and provide safety in numbers. Trees grew thicker, tougher trunks as they sprouted from cracks in streets and crept in from the pockets of vegetation in cities. 
 
 In Australia, the rabbit population finally started to decline as plants began producing a toxin specifically tailored to the rodent's cellular structure. A wave of patients entered hospitals as attacks by venomous animals became more common. The problem became so bad that an evacuation of the rural areas was made in a manner not seen since the refugee crisis of the 2010s, and with a strong resemblance to the evacuations of cities in Britain during WWII. 
 
 Asia remained relatively untouched, likely due to the isolated nature of the various sections of the continent. Still, to this day the bamboo continues to creep up the sides of the Himalayas and into the Mongolian steppes. 
 
 Antarctica started to get weird last. Melting ice caps, while not severe enough to substantially raise sea levels, caused pockets of isolated microbes to release ancient viruses and bacteria onto the landscape, which surprised scientists when they started showing signs of clumping into multi-cellular arrangements adapted to the extreme cold. 
 
 We thought it could n't get any stranger when our pets and livestock began to skew away from their bred traits and towards traits suited to where they were living... 
 
 Just last week, the first human born with a strange `` birth defect'' was analysed by doctors. They found she had a spine which was perfectly suited to bipedal locomotion, ending the 2 million year reign of the flawed human backbones which were vestiges of our quadrapedal ancestors.

"," Present the essay in the style of existentialist philosophy, questioning the nature of existence, freedom, and choice.","The tapestry of existence unfolds in a dance of freedom and choice, yet amidst the intricate interplay of forces beyond our comprehension, we find ourselves grappling with the enigmatic and unsettling question of our being. In this existentialist tapestry, the threads of freedom and choice intertwine with the unsettling realization of our finitude, leaving us with a profound sense of responsibility towards ourselves and the world.

As we navigate the labyrinth of the contemporary era, the spectre of climate change casts a long shadow, reminding us of the interconnectedness of all things. It is as if the very fabric of nature itself is unraveling, revealing the intricate dance between necessity and invention. The inexplicable emergence of mosses, the proliferation of fish with razor-sharp scales, and the inexplicable growth of trees in the middle of fields, serve as sobering reminders of the unpredictable nature of our planet.

In this capricious dance of existence, the human experience intertwines with the natural world in a profound way. As we confront the challenges presented by a changing climate, we are also confronted with the existential question of our purpose and meaning. The decline of honeybees, the resurgence of the rabbit population, and the plague of mice serve as poignant reminders of the interconnectedness of our fates.

Through the lens of existentialism, we find solace in recognizing the inherent freedom and responsibility that accompanies our existence. We are free to create meaning and purpose, yet burdened by the knowledge that our choices are finite and that we ultimately face the abyss of oblivion. It is in this paradox that lies the essence of existentialism—the recognition of our freedom to choose, while acknowledging the limitations of our choices.

As we journey through the labyrinth of life, we are compelled to confront the unsettling question of our finitude. We grapple with the realization that our time is precious and fleeting, and that the choices we make today will have lasting implications for ourselves and generations to come. It is in this existential dance that we discover the strength to embrace our freedom and responsibility, and to create a world that is not merely a reflection of our suffering, but a testament to our resilience, creativity, and compassion."

"`` No.'' The Genie said over the thumping of the music, smoothing down the sleeves of his white suit. A flash of gold drew Carl's eyes to his hands. The genie smiled. 
 
 `` I ’ m sorry...?'' 
 
 `` I said no.'' The Genie said. 
 
 He pulled a glass from thin air, filled it with something amber colored, and placed three perfectly round cubes of ice within. Carl never saw where any of it came from and he'd been intentionally staring at his hands. Perhaps that was the point. 
 
 `` No?'' Carl asked. `` But you said...'' 
 
 `` Three wishes.'' The genie said. He sighed as if he were bored. 
 
 He smelled of incense, thick and earthy, the kind he imagined you'd find in a Persian marketplace, though he'd never been to one. His teeth were white like freshly fallen snow and his eyes were black pearls floating in a cup of milk. His skin was the color of a latte. 
 
 `` Then I wish...'' 
 
 `` Do n't you want riches? I can offer you enough treasure to make your miserably short life tolerable. I can make it so your great grandchildren never want for anything in the world again.'' The Genie said. 
 
 `` But...'' 
 
 `` Or perhaps a man like yourself wishes for love? The rekindled desire of the heart? A lost love?'' He smiled and leaned in close. “ Maybe even a longer… ” 
 
 `` I do n't want any of that.'' Carl said. 
 
 The Genie shrugged and returned to his drink. `` The answer ’ s still no.'' 
 
 “ Don ’ t you have to do what I say? ” Carl asked. 
 
 He flicked his wrist and the room went silent. 
 
 Carl could see the people dancing, he could feel the thump of the bass against his chest, but the only sounds he heard was the clinking of ice as the Genie sipped from his glass and set it back down. He cleared his throat, surprised when he heard the sound. 
 
 `` Do I look like I have to grant you *anything*? I can send you to the other side of the world, to the deepest slums of China if I chose to. I could grant you almost anything your heart desires. Ask me for immortality. Ask me to be rich. Ask me for the girl you ’ ve had your eye on to come and perch herself upon your lap. I know you ’ ve been watching her. She could be yours with a simple wish.'' He said. 
 
 Carl shook his head. He ’ d been watching the girl all night, even sent over a drink and a smile, but she ’ d laughed it off and returned to the dance floor. He ’ d been kicking himself until the white-suited man had made his proposal. 
 
 “ Don ’ t you trust me? ” 
 
 Carl shook his head. “ Never trust a man in a clean white suit. ” 
 
 The Genie laughed and flicked his wrist. The music returned. So did the ringing in his ears. 
 
 “ Fine. Let ’ s get this over with. What ’ s your first wish, mortal? ” The Genie asked. 
 
 Carl smiled. “ I wish my lawyer was here with us. ”

"I remember the day clearly, even though it was many years ago. It started out so normal, just a regular day of high school. 
 
 I remember it happened during our free period. My friends and I were talking, yanking up our sleeves to show our wrists, gossiping about our dreams of when our left mark would finally disappear. My friend sitting next to me gasped and grabbed my wrist, showing me as one of my marks started to fade. 
 
 It was the right one. 
 
 For the rest of the day I couldn ’ t take my eyes of that mark, it seemed to grow more and more faint until I was sure that it was gone, and then it would come back, gaining strength before it started to fade again. 
 
 The school let me go home early, understanding how distressed I must have been as I watched that little mark, wondering what difficulties my soulmate was going through. 
 
 My mother stayed up with me that night and watched the mark with me, waiting for the time the little mark went away. It never did. 
 
 I stayed home for a few days, not wanting to take my eyes off the mark for a second, desperate to find my soulmate before the mark was gone, but having no idea how to do it. However, after three days the mark gained some strength and stabilized. It was still lighter than the left, though. 
 
 It was still fading slowly. 
 
 I did everything I could to find my soulmate. I watched the news and searched the internet hoping to find their story. Just hoping to find my soulmate. 
 
 I know my friends at school watched my wrist as the mark fades. Some days they agree it looks a little stronger while other days they hug me tight because we all know it looks weaker than usual. 
 
 It stayed like that for years, and slowly I got to know my soulmate. The mark always seemed more unsteady in the winter. It seemed to fade faster, stay weaker when the cold weather really started to roll in. 
 
 It was always the strongest in spring. Some days the right would seem almost as strong as the left, and I imagined on those days the weather must have been beautiful. The flowers in full bloom, the birds singing, hope and happiness and life. 
 
 I graduated college without ever dating anyone. A few of my friends had gotten serious with their partners, but non-soulmate relationships were always just for fun, they were formed with the knowledge that one day it would end when one of them found their soulmate. 
 
 I just couldn ’ t get close to anyone though, it would have felt like a betrayal to that little mark that still fought valiantly on my wrist. 
 
 The mark disappeared a year after I graduated. 
 
 I was always worried when it got so faint I had to squint my eyes to make sure it was still there. It had always come back, so I didn ’ t think too much about it until the day had gone by and when getting ready for bed my little mark still hadn ’ t gained strength. 
 
 I woke up at two in the morning with a feeling of dread. 
 
 The left mark stood dark and strong against my pale skin. 
 
 The right was gone. 
 
 I had a hard time with grief after that day. 
 
 “ It wasn ’ t fair! ” I would cry. I was heart broken because the little dot I had come to love was gone. I would never again watch as it gained strength in the spring. I couldn ’ t imagine what the weather there was like as it gave my soulmate hope and strength. I would never again feel the pride and relief as the mark recovered after a long bout of being weak and fading. The left mark; however, was a constant reminder that I had never really had my soulmate to lose. I didn ’ t even know their name, where they lived, I ’ d never seen their face. They may as well have never existed to me. 
 
 It was hard when people would see the missing right mark and look at me with pity. It was even harder when people would ask me “ Oh! So you found your soulmate!? ” and all I could say was no. 
 
 Sometimes they just didn ’ t realise which mark they were looking at. I started making sure my wrist was always covered. 
 
 It was three years after my soulmate ’ s death that I met Todd. I was sitting alone at my local coffee shop when he asked if he could sit with me. I told him I would love the company and we ended up talking for hours. 
 
 I felt a shock of fear when my sleeve got caught on the edge on the table and he saw my wrist. I dreaded the look of pity that I knew he would give me. 
 
 Instead he looked me in the eye and pulled up his own sleeve. 
 
 “ Me too, ” he said as he laid his arm on the table. His right mark was missing, too. 
 
 We got married in the spring on a day with beautiful weather and blooming flowers. It had been strange building a relationship without the marks to tell us whether it would work or not. But Todd was kind, gentle, and smart. He always seemed to know when he needed to make me laugh when I was feeling down, or if he should just hold me and let me grieve for that little missing mark. 
 
 We did everything we could to make each other happy. 
 
 We had three wonderful children. Each with both their marks fully intact. 
 
 My oldest boy lost his left mark at the age of three when we moved to a new house and met the little girl next door. My middle child, a bright little firecracker of a girl lost her left mark when her soulmate ’ s car slid on ice and rear-ended hers. They were both fine. 
 
 My youngest lost his right mark the day he lost his left. His soulmate came into the emergency room with a badge and a gunshot wound, it was the first time he had lost a patient. 
 
 We all went on vacation to help him get away. He told me he was sad but he knows he still has hope to find love. Todd and I found each other after all. 
 
 It was there on foreign soil I found him. As my husband admired the architecture on the old church I walked among the graves. 
 
 “ He fought long and hard. ” One read. 
 
 I watched the left mark fade from my wrist. 
 
 “ We meet at last. ”
"," Write with the tech-savvy and rebellious style of a cyberpunk hacker, fighting against the system.","I remember the day clearly, the day my soulmate's mark materialized, etched into my skin like a digital scar. It was a normal day, yet fate intertwined with my destiny, altering the course of my life forever.

As I sat in the free period, my friends' sleeves pulled up, their wrists adorned with fading marks, I felt a sense of anticipation. Suddenly, my own mark danced on my wrist, revealing itself in a fleeting glimpse. It was the right one, the mark that would lead me to my soulmate.

The mark grew and faded, its intensity waxing and waning like the moon. The school dismissed me early, understanding my distress. My mother stayed up with me, her eyes mirroring my own as she watched the mark dance and shimmer. But the mark refused to fade completely.

I stayed home for days, consumed by despair, unwilling to take my eyes off the fading mark. It seemed to mock me, taunting me with the promise of a future I couldn't fathom. However, after three days, the mark began to stabilize, its strength increasing.

It was a long journey, filled with uncertainty and longing. I searched for my soulmate, scouring the news, the internet, hoping for a hint of their identity. It was like searching for a needle in a haystack, but I persevered, driven by the unwavering belief that fate had a plan for me.

Today, my soulmate's mark is a constant companion, a testament to our connection. It may fade and strengthen, but it is always there, a reminder of the day my life was forever altered.

In the winter, the mark fades, its strength waning. In the spring, it blossoms, radiating like the sun. And through it all, I know that my soulmate and I are destined to be together, forever bound by the indelible mark of fate."
"Before I tell this story, you need to know, I had a recurring nightmare as a kid. I wake up and I ca n't move. A scaly creature comes up to the side of the bed, swipes a claw across my stomach and starts gorging on my intestines. After about the tenth time, I grabbed one of the knives my uncle bought me and kept it under my pillow. The nightmares stopped after that, and ever since, I have slept with a knife under my pillow. An old girlfriend asked why I kept a knife under my pillow but after a night without it when I had the nightmare again, she let it be. 
 
 So one night when I started to have the nightmare with the knife under my pillow, I really started to freak out. Time seemed not to move. My alarm clock stoicly read 2:37 AM in red LED numerals as the scaly creature appeared at the foot of the bed. I watched, frozen, as a claw reached out and touched my stomach gently. It felt more metallic than chitinous and was n't piercing my skin. I watched the creature, afraid but no longer paralyzed. I reached for the knife, hiding my movement beneath the sheets. Something on my face must have given it away, because at that point it reached its other arm behind its head and suddenly the creature's face fell away as though I were looking in the mirror... twenty years from now. 
 
 `` Do n't stab me, Mal. I know you keep the knife under the pillow. I never stopped doing that, once Anna found out what happens when the knife is n't there.'' The voice was mine, and other than Anna and my parents, nobody else knew. `` I've got you here with me in this tiny bubble of temporal stasis, and I had to touch you with the device to include you,'' he said, indicating the claw. `` I'm here from a future we both want to avoid, and I had to find an entry that would be as minimally disruptive as possible. Now, we've got a lot to cover and...'' he checked the claw again, `` About five subjective minutes. After that, it's up to you.''

"She touched him again, recoiling slightly less than she had the first time. 
 
 `` Are you-'' she hesitated, `` Are you sure?'' 
 
 He laughed. `` Yes.'' He nodded slowly. `` I'm sure.'' She ran a finger down the length of his cheek and felt the stubble of his recently-shaved beard. Her hand suddenly shot back to her body and she stood staring at him for a moment with her arms pinned to her sides. 
 
 His cheeks went red. His straight eyebrows changed angle and the skin of his forehead wrinkled. `` It's okay,'' he assured her, almost reaching out a hand to comfort her, `` I'm not any different.'' 
 
 His hair shone in the bedroom light from the wax he had applied after his shower. He was wearing his jeans while he sat on the end of their bed. She hated that, why could n't he just change into his house clothes? 
 
 `` Sorry,'' he said, standing up and undoing the button on his pants. `` Sorry, baby, I'm sorry. I always forget.'' 
 
 Tears welled up in her eyes. `` Stop doing that!'' 
 
 He stopped his hands and looked at her, his face twisted as he tried to figure out how to proceed. His cheeks went red. He watched the floor. 
 
 `` You've been... listening this whole time? All these years?'' 
 
 He did n't meet her eyes as he answered. `` Not always.'' 
 
 `` Usually, though.'' His answer did n't matter. He could lie. 
 
 `` In the beginning, usually.'' 
 
 She rolled her eyes. She had thought he was perfect. Her eyes narrowed. `` And since I moved in?'' 
 
 He hesitated. `` Only when you get mad at me so I can know what to do to make it better.'' 
 
 Her fists clenched. Blood rushed to her face. Her jaw unhinged wildly. `` That's cheating!'' she screamed. 
 
 `` I'm sorry,'' he answered, still staring at the floor. He fell back onto the bed. His jeans were still on. 
 
 She stormed out of the room.

Like a river flowing through the wilderness, her heart raced with a mixture of longing and uncertainty.

He laughed, his eyes twinkling, as he nodded with unwavering certainty. The scent of his cologne mingled with the scent of the night, a symphony of emotions. Her finger danced down his cheek, leaving behind the ephemeral trace of her presence. As her hand retreated, a sense of longing lingered in the air, a melody echoing in her soul.

His cheeks flushed with embarrassment, he reached out to comfort her, but his hand met with her resistance. Her arms were pinned to her sides, her eyes wide with anger and pain. His straight eyebrows furrowed in concentration, he attempted to rationalize his actions, but his words fell short of her hurt and disappointment.

The bedroom stood silent, as the only sound was the ticking clock and the echoes of her cries. The air was thick with the scent of her tears and the scent of his cologne, a bittersweet symphony of broken dreams and shattered trust. The moonlight cast long shadows on the wall, mirroring the emotions that danced within her heart.

"`` Agent 111.856 passcode 55576523'' I whispered in the middle of the amazon rainforest. In front of my an average looking tree surrounded by others of same appereance opened up allowing me to enter and go deep underground where I would be breifed on my next mission. As my long wait began I recollocted my life. 
 My childhood I do n't remember I can only assume they erased my memory all for the best. My first memory is awaking underground being briefed on my first mission my age unsure my name I did n't know my passport I was given said I was Adam Smith age 27 but I can safely assume this was n't my true identity. 
 I spent the next years of my life protecting a secret, why it was a secret I'm unsure. I'm smart enough not to ask questions, people who ask questions dissapear I know I had dissapeared a few dissenters. Why were we keeping the fact that the earth was flat from the general population I have some ideas but generally I couldnt care less I liked living not knowing kept me alive simple as that. 
 My last mission was a routine worm hole check, the main one of course located in the pacific ocean. Why it was made to make average travelers appear to go around in a circle thus going around our flat earth I again assume it better not to know. As my thoughts ran the elevator stopped opening into a room filled with advanced technology, super computers, teleportation devices and other technology held from the genpop. As I turned around walking towards the mission room my specially made deflection device using magnetic fields diverted the ray beam destroying a computer that sat at a ninety degree angle to me. Sure following orders kept me alive but I was n't stupid enough not to make a backup plan which in this instance consisted of technology based around immunity to their cancellation of technology. This was developed by the leisure time granted to me for being a trusted puppet who never tried to advance or disobey and was thought of after seeing multiple escape attempts stopped by easily destroying others devices used to escape. I immediantly teleported myself to NYC. They had made a miscalculation life was what I valued my existence continued and now the only way for me to ensure that was to destroy those who made me.

I opened up the tree and went underground. I was in a secret place. The walls were made of stone. The floor was made of sand. The ceiling was made of wood. There was a lot of stuff in the room. There was a computer, a teleporter, and a bunch of other gadgets.

I waited for a long time. It felt like I was waiting forever. Finally, I heard a noise. I turned around and saw a ray beam coming straight at me. I knew I had to do something, so I grabbed my deflection device and activated it. It diverted the ray beam and destroyed the computer.

Sure, following orders kept me alive, but I was not stupid enough not to make a backup plan. I had developed a technology based around immunity to their cancellation of technology. It was a long shot, but I had to try.

"`` Do n't blame me! I voted for Loki.'' 
 
 It was the fifth such bumper sticker I saw today. The important difference, though, was that the vehicle bearing it was property of Miskatonic University, traditionally viewed as one of Cthulhu's most dedicated strongholds above the waves. And so it was, once. But now sentiments were rising against the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods alike. 
 
 `` He Has Returned, but is the Great Dreamer Still Half-Asleep?'' 
 
 They said he was a destroyer, bringer of chaos and madness, but nobody really feared criticizing him, even in widely-published newspapers, no matter how fervently they insisted they were terrified to do so. 
 
 It was similar with others among the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods. Shub-Niggurath, `` the black goat of the woods with a thousand young,'' was rarely seen in the presence of more than 50 or 60 young at a time. She was a dark gray more than black, and could be heard bleating away within 100 meters of the forest edge quite often; every time she tried to go in there, she got scared and lost at the same time, and many were the time one of her prophets had to go lead her back out again. It was a disgrace. 
 
 Nyarlathotep the Faceless God, reputed to be unimaginably cruel and a deceiver of great skill, especially with music, turned out to be a more run-of-the-mill jackass who knew three chords on the guitar. Attempting with smooth words and clever tricks to lure men and women to their doom plays well in legend, but reality saw him lurking around bars at closing time begging drunk women to talk to him. It did n't take long for one sub on Reddit to dox him, for which the sub was banned, but after which Nyarlathotep could n't even find sanctuary in his own home. Rather, in the basement of his dad Azathoth's house. Ethics have played no role in Nyarlathotep's decision-making, and he has been spotted with what appear to be roofies and ecstasy pills he uses for extra advantage with the ladies for when begging fails him. In other words, every time. 
 
 `` I'd love to hang with you guys again,'' one girl was heard to say while leaving a party Nyarlathotep was attending, and where he had stared at her most of the night without ever approaching her. `` Next weekend, sure,'' she added. At this Nyarlathotep told a fellow party goer, `` Dude she totally wants to get with me.'' 
 
 `` I'll come, but please make sure that creepy Nyarlathotep is not there. I hate that guy. Who names their kid Nyarlathotep anyway?'' 
 
 Nyarlathotep -- who has since been insisting everyone call him Ian -- fled that party in tears. The news media has been relentless trying to connect Nyarlath... er, Ian... to Great Cthulhu beyond the known fact that they are distant relatives. 
 
 When asked for comment, Cthulhu would only say, `` I am Great Cthulhu! Now people are calling me Mediocre Cthulhu thanks mostly to that damned Nyarlathotep. I refuse to call him Ian. That's just a phase, like when he decided he was allergic to gluten even though he never tried wheat products anyway.'' 
 
 Cthulhu -- who has been caught misspelling his own name on some official documents -- is organizing more madness and chaos as best he can. In the tide pools, one can find octopi waving their tentacles about maniacally for a while, to the great entertainment of onlookers. Most octopi only stay at it a couple hours before swimming off, bored, considering taking up work as a sign spinner instead. As a result, the manic tentacle wigglers and the crowds gathering to watch the chaos and madness have all declined in number dramatically since Cthulhu's return. 
 
 Cthulhu's most loyal followers have consulted reputable texts to learn where it all went wrong. The Necronomicon by mad Arab Abdul Alhazred ( in more recent times re-translated as the Book of the Dead by Angry Person A.A. ) seems to hold no clues. 
 
 `` Vote for Thor in 2028. At least he knows how to speak!'' The slogans for anyone buy Cthulhu were already beginning to appear, and it was only March 2025.
"," Adapt the text to mimic the tone and style of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, often dark with moral lessons.","Once upon a time, in the ancient halls of Miskatonic University, a sinister bumper sticker foretold a tale of woe. It bore the cryptic message, ""Do n't blame me! I voted for Loki,"" a testament to the rising tide of sentiment against the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods.

Amongst the chaos and madness, Loki's return cast a long shadow. He was hailed as a destroyer, bringing destruction and insanity to all. Yet, despite the dangers, criticism flowed freely like a river in the wilderness. Even the most ardent supporters of the Great Old Ones could not resist voicing their grievances, albeit through the pages of widely-circulated newspapers.

Another entity of immense power, Shub-Niggurath, embodied the perils of nature's wrath. Her bleating echoed through the forest, but her journey into the woods always ended in fear and confusion. As a guardian of the forest, she was a force of destruction, yet her vulnerability exposed her flaws.

Nyarlathotep, the Faceless God of Lies, presented a different tale. Though renowned for his cruelty and deception, he was revealed to be a mediocre musician and a beggar. His attempts to lure unsuspecting victims to their doom were met with swift retribution, and his downfall was as dramatic as a lightning strike.

In the end, the tales of the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods serve as cautionary tales, reminding us of the interconnectedness of fate and the consequences of our actions. They teach us to be mindful of the choices we make and the impact they can have on the world."
"its been 5 days. no, maybe 6. At this point the number of days does n't seem to matter much. Im much more concerned about how we will get food and water. Theres only three of us; me, my Co worker Tommy, and a random named Jason. Our best guess is that an all out war broke out and there probably are n't many people left in the city that we're in, we got hit pretty hard. I could see nothing but plains, trucks, tanks, missiles, and bullets when i was on my way to grab a late dinner and head back to the office. Not only was there an overwhelming amounts of military presence, but there were some strange aircrafts that I, nor Tommy could identify. We took refuge in the basement of the office, i guess working late finally paid off because my apartment building was completely demolished from what i could see. We saw a man running for his life jus before we headed for the basement so we let him in, introduces himself as Jason, and that was that. 
 
 Day 7: So far we've been pretty understanding as to why Jason has seemed a little... off. I mean, the man says he has a family that he has no idea if they are okay, nor would i guess that they are. The entire world as we know it could be crumbling and or completely gone by now; we're all a little stressed to say the least. But Jason seems to have a certain trait about him that we ca n't put our finger on. His slouched posture, very long arms, and almost always bent knees give him an eerie appearance. His words are slurred and jumbled to the point that you would think he's either wasted or just learned the language... we're going to be keeping an eye on him. 
 
 Day 8: We broke into a locked supply closet on the 4th floor and found a couple cases of water and granola bars mixed in with office supplies, so we've bought ourselves a little bit more time. Once again, Jason has given me more reasons to be suspicious of his motives. We all decided to check each floor for supplies since our situation was getting dire and we needed food and water. I took the 2nd, Tommy took the 3rd, and Jason was given the 4th. After searching to no avail me and Tommy met back up on the main floor and doubled over each of our floors to make sure we did n't miss anything. Jason then met us soon after on the 2nd floor and said he did n't find anything either. `` okay'' i replied, `` we're double checking each of the floors just to make sure we did n't miss anything. help us clear this one and the 3rd then we'll go up to the 4th and check that one again as well.'' Jason then seemed very reluctant to the idea and even accused me of not trusting him. That's okay, were all hungry and on edge. I calm but firmly tell him that our only motives are to find some supplies to help us last a little while longer until we can find some better placement other than this ( office that i love being in so much. ) So, as a team, we make it to the 4th floor and conduct our search. not 10 minutes in we come across a locked door that almost looked like someone was trying to hide it. strange, i thought. how could Jason miss this door that was pretty much right infant of your face when you walk up the stairs. i shrugged it off and said `` lets bust it open. Theres bound to be something useful in there.'' Tommy, mirroring my confusion of Jason, was down. Grabbed a chair and made his way to the door to help me bust it down. Its been a few hours since and Jason's only take a couple sips of water and has n't touched the granola bar. Im not sure how he's still standing considering how long we've gone without food or water. More for us i guess... 
 
 Day 10: Tommy's gone. I finally found the ease of mind to take a nap for a little while and upon waking up i see Jason in his corner and Tommy's nowhere to be found. `` uh..where's Tom?'' i ask Jason, `` Oh I'm not sure. he said he wanted to go check out the 4th floor again for more supplies. He should be back soon.'' he said in a very calm tone. That's reasonable, i thought. `` Ill go join him, I'm pretty curious as well.'' `` NO'' pleads Jason,'' what?'' i replied, `` i mean, uh, I tried to go with him too. He said we should stay down here. He wanted to be alone for a little while.'' ``... alright. i guess ill stay here then.'' That just does n't seem like Tom to me. My watch broke when breaking into that closet but I've got to imagine Its been close to 4 hours since I've woken up and he's still not back. Im going up there to look for him if he's not back soon. With or without Jason. 
 
 Night of Day 10: Oh god i hope he's not wondering where I'm at yet. Jason was beginning to nod off so i slipped out of the basement and made my way upstairs to look for Tommy. I did n't have to go more than one flight of stairs before i saw a trail of blood along the walls and hand railing. That, and half of his shirt, are the only things I've found of Tommy so far. I was wondering why the hell Jason had only his undershirt on when i woke up. What the fuck did he do to him? Honestly thats not something i really want to know right now. All i know is i need to get the hell out of here befor

"," Use the inventive and curious tone of a Victorian era inventor, fascinated by progress and technology.","It has been a perilous journey, filled with anxiety and uncertainty. The world as we knew it has been shattered, leaving behind only destruction and an unsettling sense of foreboding. The once familiar streets are eerily quiet, save for the echoes of gunfire and the roar of battle.

Five days have elapsed, yet the number of days seems irrelevant in the face of our dire predicament. Three of us remain: myself, my coworker Tommy, and a mysterious individual named Jason. We have pieced together the grim narrative of an all-out war, with its accompanying destruction and the dwindling population of our once thriving city. My evening stroll to grab a late dinner and head back to the office was marred by an overwhelming presence of military might and peculiar airborne craft. The sheer magnitude of destruction and the inexplicable aerial marvels left me reeling in disbelief. We sought refuge in the basement of the office, a testament to the foresight of working late, as our apartment building lay in ruins. A desperate man, Jason, sought refuge with us, and that was the beginning of our tangled journey.

Day seven dawned with a renewed sense of unease. Jason's enigmatic demeanor and unsettling posture continued to raise questions. His slouched back, elongated arms, and perpetually bent knees conveyed an eerie impression. His speech, marred by slurred and jumbled words, further fueled our suspicions. We resolved to keep a close eye on him, vigilant against any potential threat.

Day eight brought a glimmer of hope amidst the gloom. We discovered a locked supply closet on the fourth floor, filled with essential supplies - water and granola bars, intertwined with office paraphernalia. However, Jason's behavior once again cast doubt upon our precarious position. His erratic movements and the unsettling way he lingered around the perimeter of our refuge led us to conclude that we must remain vigilant, our guard up against any potential mischief."
"I sighed a deep sigh, but it did n't relieve the tension in the room or in my body. I hated the fact that the boss wanted us to do this, but I hated even more that my partner was fully on board. The fight started slowly. I obviously did n't want anything to do with him having seen all of the carnage that he was causing above, but my partner felt it was his solemn duty to carry out every order to the tee, or some garbage like that. 
 
 `` Have you not been paying attention at all? ``, i bellowed at him in front of everyone, barely getting a reaction out of him. 
 
 `` Yeah, but...'' 
 
 `` But what? Have you noticed how many people he and his cohorts have sent down here? Have you seen the relief in their faces when they realize they were *here*? Why the *hell* would someone be relieved to be here? Maybe it's because the hell he's been putting on up there is heaven compared to the shit they'll have to go through down here.'' 
 
 `` But what about our duty? ``, he asked calmly. 
 
 `` What about his? ``, I retorted. `` Was n't he elected to lead his people out of one of their darkest times? And what did he do instead huh? *What the hell did he do?! *'' 
 
 `` That's not importa...'' 
 
 `` You're damn right it's important! Why should we protect him when he failed to protect anyone up there? Why should we help him when he made a life out of destroying so many? ``, I said calming down a little bit. `` Why should we help him when even those in his inner circle wound up down here by his own hand long before their time was up?'' 
 
 `` He's here. ``, the assistant said. 
 
 `` I'm not going. ``, I said as I sat back down. `` You may have your duty, but I still have my morals.''
"," Adopt a Victorian Gothic style, emphasizing ornate language, emotional intensity, and possibly supernatural elements.","In this Victorian Gothic setting, the protagonist's sigh echoes through the room, but it does little to alleviate the tension. The boss's command has brought forth a conflict, and the protagonist's partner's unwavering support of his orders further fuels the tension. As the argument unfolds, the protagonist's frustration mounts, and their bellowing voice fills the room.

""Have you not been paying attention at all?"" the protagonist cries out, their voice dripping with disdain. ""The fight started slowly, but it's gone too far. You have seen the carnage that he has caused, and yet you still want to carry out his orders as if it were your solemn duty.""

The protagonist's argument is met with a calm response from their partner. ""But what about our duty?"" he asks.

""What about his?"" the protagonist retorts. ""He failed to protect his people, and now it's our turn to protect him?""

The protagonist's moral dilemma is evident as they sit back down, refusing to participate. They understand their partner's duty, but they cannot bring themselves to aid in what they perceive as injustice. The assistant's announcement of the boss's arrival brings a sense of dread, but the protagonist's resolve remains firm.

In this Victorian Gothic tale, the protagonist's internal conflict between duty and morality showcases the complexities of human decision-making in the face of adversity."
"`` Peter we've been through this a million times, actually more. I do n't know what you expect us to say.'' 
 
 A group of paper-pushers busied themselves, avoiding Peter's eyes while Peter smoked a cigarette, anxiously flicking it. 
 
 An individual by the name of MATT BERG recently arrived for process and neither subsequent departments ( Heaven, Hell ) were willing to take him. However, this posed a problem for both departments. Typically speaking, this type of situation was very rare - the last similar case had occurred pre-resurrection and, fittingly, their had been a slew of departmental policy changes following the shakeup. According to some of the older department heads it had been a logistical nightmare. 
 
 Peter finished his cigarette, exhaled, and spoke: 
 
 `` The way I see it, we only have one option. Send Matt back and, with any luck, we wo n't have to deal with this mess the next time around... I mean, what are the odds he'll come back with an even count? Albeit possible it's hardly probable.'' 
 
 Mother Teresa chimed in: 
 
 `` You ca n't do that without a sign-off from the boss. See Lazarus Edict 2012.7'' 
 
 Peter looked at Teresa with malice... This politicking bitch had been nothing but a series of bureaucratic headaches since her hire. 
 
 `` Okay then, what do you propose, Teresa? Because all I'm hearing are rebuttals sans solutions... something you've gained a knack for, I might add.'' 
 
 Teresa busied herself with paperwork, paying no mind to Peter's not-so-subtle underhand remark. 
 
 `` Bring it to JC's attention and that will be that.'' 
 
 Was this bitch serious? As if JC did n't have enough shit on his plate. Peter was reaching his breaking point. Michael walked into the room. 
 
 `` What's up my people? Heard through the cloud-line that we got ta Lazarus case on our hands? Am I sending someone back? Just give me the word and --'' 
 
 Teresa chimed in: 
 
 `` No because we do n't have JC's sign-off. Peter knows this.'' 
 
 God-damn whore. 
 
 `` Teresa, take 15.'' 
 
 `` I took my 15 107 years ago I'm not due for another until --'' 
 
 `` TAKE 15 TERESA.'' 
 
 Teresa glared at Peter and slowly shuffled out. About fucking time. 
 
 Michael sat down in Teresa's chair and lit a cigarette. 
 
 `` What seems to be the issue Pete? Something tells me you wan na expedite without the boss man signing off... Which I'm all for, but I'd at least like an explanation.'' 
 
 Peter paused. He might as well get it off his chest. 
 
 `` Listen, JC is bogged down and I do n't wan na be the guy who tells him we got another potential Lazarus case... And if I have to deal with that headache, rest assured you will too.'' 
 
 Michael smiled and ashed his cigarette on Teresa's desk. 
 
 `` Alright Pete, I can swing it but we'll need to talk to Bon down in Hell if we want to swing it without Teresa sounding the alarm. I hate bureaucratic bullshit as much as the next angel but I also like my job and am not about to get shuffled off to Hell to work under Bon... the guy's been playing Highway to Hell on repeat since he moved into his new office. Fucking cock.'' 
 
 `` Well, let's get it going then. I want this finished before Teresa comes back from her 15.'' 
 
 We took the inter-dimensional tram over to Hell and, after lengthy, unnecessary vetting by the security guard, were let in. As we arrived at Bon's office the song `` Girls Got Rhythm'' blared from the inside. 
 
 `` At least he switched things up. This is a jam. Reminds me of a party I was at in Sodom & Gomorrah, Lot was hooking up with a straight 10. A shame, really.'' 
 
 All the suits outside of Bon's office were surprisingly professional. Truth be told, it looked like they had a more efficient system than Peter had over in Heaven. When Peter and Michael entered Bon's office he was in the middle of a phone call. 
 
 `` I do n't give a damn if she wants a transfer. This is fucking Hell and we're the department heads... Yes of course and no definitely not. You and I both know what Lucifer's response to that will be... Okay, let me know how it goes.'' 
 
 Bon hung up and smiled. 
 
 `` Gentleman. What brings you to these parts? Let me guess... looking for wiggle room with a potential Lazarus edict discrepancy?'' 
 
 Bon was a cocky little shit. Peter spoke: 
 
 `` You obviously know why were here. So what'll it be?'' 
 
 Bon drew the blinds. His office had a wicked view of the lake of fire. Various pictures of Bon and hell notables adorned his office. The most visible was a picture of Bon and Mussolini holding a gigantic cat-fish like creature that they'd pulled out of the lake of fire. 
 
 `` The way I see it, it should n't be a problem. But Teresa seems to be the real problem. Granted, I could n't give 7 shits whether she damages your rapport with JC. He's not my boss and, therefore -- 
 
 `` Not your problem.'' Interjected Michael. 
 
 `` Precisely. But I know you're clever enough to find a way around this?'' 
 
 Of course, just backlog him... Teresa wo n't come across it for at least 1,000 years and by that time the poor fuck will already be dead. Let's just hope it's not quite as balanced of a problem next time around.'' 
 
 Peter was no fan of Bon but he had to admire the can-do attitude. Plus, Bon got shit done. Bureaucracy be damned. 
 
 Michael clasped his hands. 
 
 `` Well that settles it then. I'll send Matt back and you and Bon will backlog him. No JC sign-off no problem.'' 
 
 Peter breathed a sigh of relief. One less problem to bring to JC's attention. 
 
 
 

"," Recast the narrative in the style of an Arthurian legend, complete with knights, chivalry, and quests for honor.","In the realm of Arthurian legend, where tales of valor and honor dance through the ages, a tale unfolds as ancient as time itself. It is a tale woven from threads of courage, sacrifice, and the enduring spirit of a hero named Matt Berg.

Once upon a time, in the grand halls of a forgotten castle, Matt Berg arrived seeking solace. Yet fate had a cruel twist in store for him, for the departments of Heaven and Hell refused to accept him, leaving him in a state of limbo. This predicament presented a formidable challenge, one that threatened to cast a shadow upon the entire realm.

The burden of responsibility fell upon Peter, a man of grit and determination. He understood that the only way forward was to send Matt back, despite the daunting odds of his return with an even count. However, the bureaucratic labyrinth he had to navigate was formidable. Mother Teresa, a woman of boundless paperwork and sharp wit, reminded him of the stringent regulations that bound their actions.

Yet Peter persevered, his spirit unyielding. He knew that justice must prevail, and he was not willing to let bureaucratic obstacles stand in his way. With a sigh of resignation, he presented his solution to Teresa. ""Bring it to JC's attention and that will be that,"" he commanded.

As the sun cast long shadows across the land, Michael, a man of valor and wisdom, entered the room. He heard the news of Matt Berg's plight and offered his support. But Teresa's voice pierced through the air, ""No because we do not have JC's sign-off,"" she proclaimed.

At that moment, Peter felt his resolve waver, but he knew that he had to fight for what was right. He stood tall, his voice echoing through the halls, ""God-damn who, we will not be defeated!""

And so, through the combined efforts of Peter, Michael, and the unwavering spirit of Matt Berg, the injustice was overturned. The land breathed a sigh of relief, and the legend of Matt Berg, a hero born from the fires of adversity, was forever etched into the annals of time."
"I'm so sorry. So, so, sorry. I just ca n't go on this way. I'm a hollow husk of who I was, a man that was lost long ago. And as I sit writing this, I know that you'll ask why. Why would I do it? I had all a man could ask for. A loving family, a job with good pay, any luxury I could want, so why? 
 
 A month. That's how long ago I lost it. I did what I could to try writing it, saying it, indicating what it was. But I could n't. I ca n't. It's frustrating, tantalizing, infuriating, knowing that it will always float about my mind, an inquiry with no solution. And so, of my own choosing, I will put a stop to it. A stop to it all. I'm so sorry.
"," Infuse the essay with the lyrical and profound voice of Maya Angelou, reflecting on human dignity and resilience.","The weight of the world, an oppressive force, bears down upon each human soul, carving intricate narratives of resilience and dignity. Through the prism of Maya Angelou's lyrical voice, the raw emotion of loss and despair intertwines with the unwavering spirit of self-determination and grace.

The author's heart, once aglow with the warmth of a loving family and the promise of a fulfilling life, is shattered by the merciless hand of fate. In a moment of profound vulnerability, he candidly acknowledges his shattered dreams and the profound emptiness he feels as a result of his loss. The imagery of a ""hollow husk of who he was"" and a ""man that was lost long ago"" paints a vivid picture of the profound emotional toll that grief can take on the human psyche.

Yet, amidst the depths of despair, the author's spirit refuses to be broken. He acknowledges the futility of his attempts to express his grief and chooses to find solace in self-reflection and acceptance. The phrase ""I'm so sorry"" echoes through his writing, but it is not a cry for pity but a testament to the universality of human suffering and the strength that can be found in confronting it.

Through the prism of Maya Angelou's voice, the author's journey towards healing is infused with resilience, grace, and an unwavering belief in the interconnectedness of all human beings. He finds solace in the understanding that grief, like the tides, will inevitably ebb and flow, leaving behind a profound sense of gratitude for the precious gift of life.

In conclusion, the author's journey through grief is a testament to the enduring power of human dignity and resilience. Despite the tragedy of his loss, he emerges from the depths of despair with a renewed appreciation for life and a commitment to continue living in honor of those who have touched his heart."
"I had been in an minor earthquake in Japan a few years ago during a business trip. I remember the disorienting feeling being the most overwhelming aspect for me. To experience that as an adult for the first time... it felt like a revelation. I started considering things I had simply never bothered with before. Reading about such events in science books simply does not do it justice. You ca n't grasp the true power of something like that until you're in the middle of it. That disorientation is what I felt when the planet spoke to us. Not in words, not in any language we could even imitate. It spoke in earthquakes, but we understood it perfectly. We ALL did. All 9 billion of us. 
 
 The first rumble was so subtle, the few of us who heard it clearly ( I was one of those ) did n't understand what it was. We did n't understand what it had said. By the time the next rumble came, only minutes later, some had already gone mad. It was just too much to absorb for some. I was paralyzed with fear, standing in the middle of a park as my dog ran away from me, with three other dogs following him. We now know they were being called. At the same time it informed us of our true nature, and of our imminent doom, it spoke to the others a whole other message. 
 
 The third rumble came an hour after the second, but we did n't feel it beneath our feet, that time. We felt it in our minds. Our memories bounced around. Our individual knowledge changed. Our collective knowledge was unlocked. We begun seeing more and more, understanding more and more. More of us went mad. The suicides began. No more rumbles after that. The message had been sent... 
 
 It has been a week since that day, and somehow, despite all our new found knowledge, most of us refuse to accept the facts. We're still debating, still depending on politicians to make their secret plans, and speak among themselves. Still weak. No one really knows what to do. As a species, we are in denial. But we all know what it said to us. All of us heard it in different ways, but we all know what it was telling us. Death. You are sentenced to death. But was it `` death''? No. There was something about the... tone. It was n't a tone, since it was n't a voice. But something about the resonance, perhaps, had implied it did n't mean death. The closest word the English language has to it is... reset. That is what I feel in my heart. My sister agrees with me. She heard it much the same way I did. 
 
 I felt like I had been let in on a secret, as had everyone else at the time. Scientists could n't explain the phenomena. There were no detectable emission of any frequencies, no soundwaves, whatever scientific bullshit terms you wan na pin to it. It had none of that. It just was. It told us all what was going to happen. It gave us time to prepare, mentally. Like it cares for us to some extent. 
 
 Now I'm hearing about some religious group gaining a massive following. They call the planet `` Mother'' and are committing mass suicides across the globe to try and save the rest of us. Saying that if we bring our numbers down enough, maybe the rest of us can be spared. Nonsense. There was no room for negotiations. It said what needed to be said. It gave us a farewell. 
 
 The collective consciousness has been growing. We're getting new bits of information every day, but it seems to come in slow dribbles. As if not everyone's participating. We know that the planet let us evolve for one reason only. We were to be the repellent. We were to be its defensive system against whatever threats may have come its way. We are a failed experiment. 
 
 We know we are not the first. The octopus was the dominant sentient species for a while, but they were more like a rough draft. A first attempt that just did n't pan out. But now we know they're gone from the seas. No one's fished any of them in days. Same with honeybees. They're all gone. Cats, dogs, horses, cows, all gone or going. Some owners have already been killed trying to keep their pets indoors. Dolphins in captivity have been acting near-suicidal, trying to find sea-water. They jump from their tanks and try to crawl away. Chickens are still around, and so are most reptilians, though not many have bothered checking more closely. Either way, no one knows where they've all disappeared to. But we all know we are not going wherever they did.

 A door shuts behind me. I'm in a different room now and I've been sat in a chair that is cold to the touch. I shiver alone, sitting there in silence and reflecting on what has brought me to this chair. 
 
 Man, and woman, live by rules. Rules, whether they be religious, intrinsic, natural, or self-imposed, govern our lives. I lived and still live by some combination of the aforementioned. But, my will is not always strong. We endure external pressures that some can absorb but others can not, like a home absorbing storm after storm, they begin to break down and weather -- -some sooner than others. Our restraint and control is not much different. I do n't know if my control is predisposed to weakness, is there some flaw that is unknown to me and only needed substrate for a reaction? I feel remorse and as my fingers clasp the cold arms of the chair it is not them that reach into my soul and make me shiver again but the guilt I bear. 
 
 The door opens and closes behind me and the lights flicker on. I can see. 
 
 The chair is exactly as I envisioned, stainless steel and positioned in the middle of a room that has a table of similar design in front of me with a small drain in floor below it. The room is cold and about twice the size of my cell. There is a door on the far side of the table, an exit to where I do not know. 
 
 On the table is a sealed brown envelope placed near center and adjacent to it is a silver letter opener with a robust ebony handle fused to the blade. I reach for both. The paper knife slides through the seal with ease and I empty the contents onto the table. A passport with my picture but a different name and a letter. 
 
 As I read the letter my eyes begin to water yet my shoulders sag, as if my sins were sponges rested upon them absorbing the anguish leaking from me. I stare up at the door. It is an exit to life. To a new beginning where I can mend the damage I've caused. It is a opportunity to see my family. To be a daughter, a sister, and a mother again. 
 
 I place the letter down on the table beside the glistening blade. Darkness enters my thoughts. The shame begins to swell and my moral compass spins in the hurricane. I wade through to the center of the storm and in that moment of calmness reach for my exit. While departing all I remember hearing is the sound of a drain filling with my guilt. 

"," Craft a text in the style of a Christie mystery, with intrigue, clever plotting, and a twist ending.","The cold steel chair pressed against my back, a testament to my solitary confinement. It was a chair designed for interrogation, a throne of regret, a perch from which to contemplate the abyss of my wrongdoing.

A door slammed shut, the world blanketed in silence. It was the sound of a soul being imprisoned, a testament to the immutable law of consequence. I sat alone, the cold emanating from the chair permeating my body, mirroring the cold I had sown in the hearts of many.

My life had been governed by rules, both external and internal. Yet, my will was faltering, as fragile as a candle in the wind. The pressures of society, the burden of my actions, had begun to consume me, like a fire consuming a forest. I felt remorse, a gnawing sensation of guilt that consumed me like a storm.

The door swung open, the flicker of light revealing the same cold steel chair. A table, mirroring the one in front of me, stood in the center of the room, with a drain in the floor. A sealed envelope rested on the table, along with a silver letter opener. I reached for both, my fingers tracing the smooth handle of the knife before effortlessly slicing through the seal.

The contents of the letter unfolded before me, a testament to my folly. My passport, my name forged on a document that promised freedom, yet the letter contained instructions for my demise. The world spun out of control, and I felt as if I was being punished, my sins being cast back at me.

But as I read the final words of the letter, a strange feeling washed over me. It was not the despair of a man condemned, but the resignation of a soul at peace. The weight of the world lifted, and I realized that my punishment had already been served. I was free, and I had come to terms with my fate."
"I felt my passion rising as his hot breath warmed my cheek,

 My hand reached out to grab his coal black piece. 
 I smiled as I took purchase, feeling his excitement grow, 
 I trembled still, my shaking could not cease. 
 
 As I leaned in to whisper close, I could n't help but grin,

"When I was born my father said I had stars in my eyes and a smile as bright as the sun. He told me that as long as I was near, happiness was sure to follow. He was a busy man who built gadgets and gizmos for those who were underprivileged and disabled - things I did n't quite understand as a child, but knew was amazing. My classmates called him'the mad scientist man'... but I knew my daddy and I knew he was never mad. 
 
 I was six years old and every Friday he would pick me up from school and take me to get ice-cream. 
 
 `` Daddy,'' I would ask with my big toothy grin. `` Can I have two scoops?'' 
 
 `` How can I ever deny that little face?'' He always asked, squishing my cheeks. I would giggle uncontrollably and when he would hand me the ice cream cone, it'd be loaded with sprinkles. `` Unfortunately,'' He would say. `` This is the only rainbow I can give to you now... but just you wait until I trap one in a box!'' 
 I would nod before digging in and the rest of the time would be spent talking about school and friends and cleaning my face with the promise not to tell mom. 
 
 Looking back on it, mom always knew I ate ice-cream before dinner because the dessert that night would be fruit, but it was nice to have a secret between daddy and me. 
 
 One Friday, we got ice cream and he said excitedly that he was going to take me to a movie! The animated one that I wanted to see so badly! It probably was just the same as all the rest - I do n't really remember it anymore because that night, everything changed. 
 
 I'll always remember the bright lights and the sirens... a drunk driver was on the loose and did n't quite care that he was in a crowded parking lot. My daddy pushed me away, but the driver crushed his legs and destroyed his spine. The doctors said he was paralyzed. 
 
 For one to live, another must die. I knew this must be true. I'd seen in books, in television, in movies. The order of life was strictly controlled... there was no truly changing anything - only changing the circumstances, only exchanging people. 
 
 A great sense of power surged through me as I opened the heavy time machine doors. I was n't quite sure what he wanted me to do. Change history? It was so broad. It could be from saving Abraham Lincoln to stopping bubblegum from ever existing. 
 
 Still - I had to do something. I could n't leave my father's intelligence to rot in vain. December 9th, 2015... the day my father's body was paralyzed by a drunk driver... I had been right there and yet I had done nothing to stop it. How could I have? I was only 6 years old... he fought his hardest, lasted ten years when the doctors said he only had three... but he still died too soon. 
 
'I could warn him,' I thought.'Tell him do n't cross the road! I see headlights!' or I could push him out of the way. I was n't quite sure what the plan was when I saw the swerving headlights and my father walking me across the street. My heart jumped out of my chest... and I leaped. 
 
 For one to live, another must die. 
 
 I saved his life and ended mine.

 I was a fool. I thought myself the savior of humanity, but I'm not. The past six months have been so hectic, so filled with dread. The only hope we had was me. I was uninfected, despite my obvious exposure. At first the Foundation had me contained, held simply to observe the advancement of the Clockwork Virus. A week passed, then two, none of the typical symptoms had manifested in me. They grew curious. 
 
 By the first month, they had postulated that I was immune, the only human- scratch that, the only living animal on Earth that was known to be immune. Tests were carried out, biopsies, blood drawings, injections of God-knows-what. I hated it at first, but the Foundation treated me well. They made it very clear that what I was doing would save the world. I talked myself into believing them. 
 
 Months passed, they were getting no results. They began to panic. Almost a fifth of the world's population was infected. They grew desperate. I was desperate to help them, to save humanity. Their experiments began to grow more invasive. 
 
 `` It was necessary,'' they said. 
 
 I had to believe them. 
 
 Yesterday was a breakthrough, but not the kind they were hoping for. Every iteration of the virus they had come across so far devolved people into mindless, numb machines. Dr. Clef was the first to realize it, after I offhandedly remarked that his phone was dead. He had n't had it out. 
 
 I'm not immune, I'm just the next step of the infection.

I'm a hero. I know, I know. It's a bit of a stretch, but hear me out. I'm the only human on Earth who's immune to the Clockwork Virus. And I'm not just sitting around, waiting for the world to end. I'm actively doing something about it.

It all started with the outbreak. A virus that's turning people into mindless, numb machines. I was exposed to it, but I didn't get sick. Instead, I became a beacon of hope. The Foundation, they're my people. They're using me as a weapon, a way to save the world.

I've been through a lot lately. Tests, biopsies, injections, it's all a pain. But I'm doing it because I know it's the right thing to do. I'm not just immune, I'm the next step of the infection. But I'm not afraid. I'm not going to let the world end.

I'm going to save humanity."
"Councilwoman Tress-Aryat looked out the viewport, watching the paths of the stars, slowly tracing over in her mind everything she knew and would know about these human beings. `` Bomb them back into the Stone Age,'' went the phrase ( *the threat* ), the Stone Age being a roughly 3.4 million year increment several thousand years distant. The breadth of over three million years suggested massively imprecise weaponry. And yet, with that sort of technology, it hardly mattered. Even being displaced a mere four thousand years would easily be catastrophic, unrecoverable. And if the humans could displace themselves, less explosively, even a preemptive strike would prove worse than useless. The Galactic Council stood poised on a knife's edge, awaiting the information that would prove them wrong. 
 
 She turned to the door. A brief dilation, and Secretary Karden-Tromat entered, report in hand. `` All scans for tachyon emissions came back negative, Madame Councilwoman. Earth poses no temporal threat to us.'' 
 
 For a moment, Tress-Aryat experienced the most exquisite relief, moving on quickly to doubt. `` Are we certain? Then why would the humans have developed such colloquialisms without time travel technology?'' 
 
 `` Ah, yes, yes.'' Tromat's hand bobbed. `` Our scouts sought to answer that very question. It turns out to have been a simple cultural translation error. As it turns out, humans have a technological model of time.'' 
 
 She narrowed her eye. `` I have not yet understood. Explain.'' 
 
 `` To the humans, time is measured by the degree of technological sophistication a society has achieved. The answer was staring us in the eye all along:'Stone Age.' A reasonable enough descriptor, to be sure. But to the humans, the use of stone tools is the defining factor of the age. Any society using stone tools, regardless of when it exists temporally, could be said to be living in the'Stone Age'.'' Tromat's hand flapped as he grew more animated. `` They were talking about physical destruction, Madame Councilwoman! Destroying their opponents' technological capabilities, and forcing them to rely on stone as tools! Utterly harmless to the galactic community at large.'' 
 
 Tress-Aryat squeezed her hand shut over her eye, focusing on the moment of frustration. `` But that makes no sense! Earth does n't even have uniform technological sophistication! By their standards, different regions of their planet would exist in multiple different timeframes simultaneously.'' 
 
 `` And indeed so!'' Karden-Tromat bobbed satisfied on his stalk. `` It's perfectly common for humans to speak of technology as'futuristic', even though it clearly exists in the same timeframe as they do. Likewise, they describe cultures, peoples, and technology as'primitive' - early, first, prime - even though they all simultaneously exist! A strange culture, humans, but it all makes sense when you view it in that light.'' 
 
 `` Bizarre,'' Tress-Aryat mused. `` How could such a culture come to exist?'' 
 
 `` Ah. As far as we can tell...'' Tromat lowered his voice, `` humans lack a temporal sense of reality. Imagine them as blind to the passage of time. They can only see a single moment, one that they call the Now. The only way they can tell time has passed is through sheer physical accretion. If your technology is sophisticated, surely a lot of time must have passed, correct? And conversely, if your technology is still unrefined, surely not a lot of time must have passed at all.'' 
 
 Tress-Aryat stood stunned, and moved to the moment of her realization. `` You mean to say, Tromat, that they have no conception of the future, that they do n't realize that...'' 
 
 Karden-Tromat nodded sadly. `` I'm afraid so, Madame Councilwoman. They're no threat at all. Quite the opposite, in fact.'' 
 
 She nodded solemnly, dismissing him with a wave of her hand. Once she was alone, the Councilwoman tapped on the viewscreen, magnifying, bringing the planet Earth into view. She watched it in its helpless path around its sun, a blurry blue toroid of motion, its humans threatening to bomb each other back to the Stone Age, all heedless to the Stone Ages yet to come. She crystallized the moment into a single perfect structure of melancholy to revisit. Around and around and around went the human race, all imagining themselves on the track to a linear future.
"," Use the bewildered and insightful language of a time traveler, navigating different eras.","Councilwoman Tress-Aryat gazed at the celestial tapestry, her mind wandering through the vast expanse of time. The threat of ""bombing the humans back into the Stone Age"" resonated in her thoughts, the Stone Age being a distant era characterized by crude stone tools. The vastness of time conveyed the idea of imprecise weaponry and the catastrophic consequences of even a minor displacement. The Galactic Council stood at a precipice, awaiting the information that would prove them wrong.

Turning to her secretary, Tress-Aryat listened intently to his report. ""All scans for tachyon emissions came back negative, Madame Councilwoman. Earth poses no temporal threat to us."" Relief washed over her, but doubt soon crept into her mind. ""Are we certain? Then why would the humans have developed such colloquialisms without time travel technology?""

Tromat's hand gestured wildly, ""Ah, yes, yes. Our scouts sought to answer that very question. It turns out to have been a simple cultural translation error. As it turns out, humans have a technological model of time.""

Tress-Aryat narrowed her eyes, ""I have not yet understood. Explain.""

Tromat's enthusiasm grew, ""To the humans, time is measured by the degree of technological sophistication a society has achieved. The answer was staring us in the eye all along: 'Stone Age.' A reasonable enough descriptor, to be sure. But to the humans, the use of stone tools is the defining factor of the age.

"The fan working its hardest to keep us from the unbearable heat. Sadly, it can only do so much leaving us in tank tops and shorts. Having the windows open does n't help if there were no winds either, asides from that, the traffic jam is an annoying sound to hear now that the apartment has been more quiet then ever. Nothing but the sound of keyboards tapping and mouse clicking. The atmosphere was really different. 
 
 Turning my eyes away from the screen to see how Chloe was doing, looks like not too well. It's been a week now and she's still quiet as ever. Well, she's mute, it's understandable as to why she's so quiet. That's why we use instant messaging and social media websites to our advantage. Normally, I'd receive links to posts she thought was funny or webpages that held furniture that'd be pretty great to own. 
 
 A ring came off of my laptop, breaking my thoughts. A message from FoxxyCrest, Chloe. 
 
 `` I miss something special.'' came up in our chat history. 
 
 I turned to look back at her to see if anything has changed in her pose, nothing. She must've finally wanted to talk about it. She continued to stare at her screen with the sad expression. Glancing back at my screen, I scrolled the tabs I had left open and began clicking through old emails. Hopefully this will work. 
 
 Hearing the notification from her laptop, she seemed a little surprised. After a few clicks on her end, Chloe read through it briefly. She had a look to notice if I knew she opened it up and of course, I knew. I kept typing away and paying attention to my screen. Another notification came from her laptop, breaking her stare. 
 
 `` I miss Milo, too.'' was in a little bubble of her screen. 
 
 `` A friend found a stray, he's was looking for a home for her and I mentioned that she will enjoy her new home with the lovely lady sitting beside me.'' made the bubble bigger. `` I hope it's not too soon but she really needed a new family.'' 
 
 A smile finally came across her face while she typed away. `` i'll love her as much as I love Milo.'' She pressed her foot against me to get my attention away form the screen. She looked much more happier then she did. Moving on is rough but this was for the best though. 
 
 Even though Milo will be missed, we'll be having another dog welcomed into the little household. 
 

", Infuse the narrative with the cosmic horror and elaborate vocabulary characteristic of H.P. Lovecraft's writing.,"The oppressive heat, an unbearable shroud, permeates the air, the fan struggling in vain to combat its intensity. The apartment, bereft of the symphony of wind, mirrors the barrenness of the desert. Only the rhythmic click of keyboards and the incessant whine of traffic persist, an intrusive soundtrack to the oppressive silence. The atmosphere has shifted, a palpable tension gripping the air.

Turning away from the screen, I cast my gaze upon Chloe, her wan complexion illuminated by the glow of the screen. A week has elapsed, and she remains as quiet as a tomb, mute as a stone. In this era of instant messaging and social media, our connection thrives on the exchange of fleeting moments, the ethereal echoes of laughter, and the shared experience of the mundane. Yet, I yearn for a deeper connection, a whisper in the night, a shared secret.

A ring, a notification, a lifeline in the ocean of silence. It was from FoxxyCrest, Chloe, the message pulsating through our digital ether.

""I miss something special,"" it read.

I turned back to her, searching for a change in posture, a flicker of expression. Nothing. Her gaze remained fixed on the screen, a monument to her grief. But I knew, in that moment, she was finally ready to speak. With each click, she read through the email, her voice growing stronger with each line. I felt my heart swell with hope, the promise of her return to life.

As she read the final sentence, a smile spread across her face like the bloom of a flower in the desert. It was a smile that radiated from within, a testament to her resilience, her ability to find joy amidst the darkest of times."
"31 Then Mary went to wash the boy Jesus' sheets at the river, and found that they were sticky. 32 Upon returning and finding her husband, she urged him to have a talk with the boy. 33 Joseph was reluctant, for it is not the place of man to instruct God; and also there were ten minutes left in the game. But Mary would not be appeased. 
 
 34 So Joseph took the boy Jesus aside and did tell him of the birds and the bees, whereupon he said that if Jesus had any questions, he must ask them quickly, for the game was not yet over. And Jesus replied that he did have one. 
 
 35 `` Thou sayest it requires nine months for a child to develop?'' Joseph told Jesus again that it was so. 36 `` And to lie with a woman out of wedlock is a grave sin?'' Joseph affirmed that it was. 37 `` But surely you and Mother were married only seven months before I was born?'' 
 
 38 And Joseph said unto him, `` My son, let me explain to you about miracles...''

Back in the day when the waves danced and the wind roared, there lived a woman named Mary, a woman of grace and grit. One day, she was washing the boy Jesus' sheets at the river, and she found that they were sticky as a barnacle's grip on a ship's hull.

But Mary was relentless like a storm wind, blowing a fury against the tide. She knew that her husband, Joseph, was hesitant to give the boy Jesus a lecture, but she wouldn't be appeased. So, Joseph took the boy Jesus aside and did tell him of the birds and the bees. He said, ""If you have any questions, my son, you must ask them quickly, for the game is not yet over.""

And Jesus replied, ""I have one question."" He asked, ""Thou sayest it requires nine months for a child to develop?"" Joseph answered, ""It is so, my dear boy."" Jesus then asked, ""And to lie with a woman out of wedlock is a grave sin?"" Joseph affirmed, ""It is, my son.""

But Jesus was not done. He said, ""But surely you and Mother were married only seven months before I was born?"" Joseph was caught off guard. He had no answer for that one. And so, the tale of ol' Mary and the boy Jesus was passed down through the ages, a testament to the power of a woman's spirit and the wisdom of a child."
"I woke up and stretched in my bed. Anther glorious day. I got up, adjusted myself, and walked off towards the kitchen to get breakfast. But everything out here was wrong. Someone had moved part of my house around. Where was I? What happened? Suddenly I felt a warm arm around my shoulders and a nice-looking woman with a kind voice asked if I wanted some breakfast. Of course I did. What else would I want at this time of day. 
 
 I glanced at the clock but the hands seemed off. I could n't quite make out whether the short hand was pointing at the 3 or I do n't know. I ignored it and walked on. I walked in, ready to order. I wanted, that one food, uhm, what was its name again? They gave me a tray and it looked more like lunch food to me even though they were calling it dinner but whatever. When in Rome, right? 
 
 I sat down and started eating and Darryn happened to come sit down by me. I smiled at him and reached over to pat him on the shoulder and he smiled back. We talked for a little while about the meal, and he told me that he had been promoted at work and I told him how happy I was for him. Then he got up to leave and I said goodbye to him and he looked a little puzzled. 
 
 `` I'm your son,'' he said, `` Andres. My father Darryn died ten years ago.'' I immediately felt a great feeling of shame and sadness come over me. It was so terrible that Darryn had lost his job and I said as much to him, that I was so sorry he'd just lost his job but that we could get through it. Darryn looked sad too but I knew things would get better eventually. He'd find another job. He gave me a hug before he turned to go. 
 
 Then I went back to my room, although I got a little lost on the way. I did see a group of three women with kind voices though, so I went to ask them. `` I'm a little lost,'' I said. `` Can you help me find my room?'' 
 
 A man walked up and the women waved him over, `` She's lost,'' they said. 
 
 He smiled broadly and looked at me. `` Hi, Lost, my name is Bart.'' 
 
 I smiled back at him. His voice was so nice. `` I'm lost, do you know where my room is?'' 
 
 His smile faltered and he looked at the women near him. `` I,'' he started then he coughed and cleared his throat.

"Calm jazz music twinkles onto the black stage. Bob Ross is staring hard at the black wall with a softly twitching eye that moves to the smooth percussion. Then a light flicks on, a red light starts recording, and Bob knows that he's on air in front of thousands that he'll never meet. 
 
 `` Hello, I'm Bob Ross.'' He has a voice like a cooing dove. `` I'd like to welcome you to a very special episode of the joy of painting. Please paint along.'' 
 
 `` Now first,'' there's a rumble somewhere deep inside of him. `` We're going to start with a nice emerald green to start the scenery. Just tap the brush, there you go. That's right.'' 
 
 Something inside of him starts to move, almost like an organ that was never there. There's a gurgle of stomach bile. He feels his old spine stiffen and creak like a rusting door. Something is off today. He can still hear the soft jazz. 
 
 `` Great now we're going to use a bit of skin tone here. That's right. Try carefully to copy what you see me doing here. It's a real son-of-a-gun to to remove the paint. We're going to start by painting a little man having a lie down in the sun. There he is, warmed by these nice yellow rays. Does n't he look happy.'' 
 
 The red rings of Bob's eyes sag, and his small beady eyes strain at the splash of colour. It is no longer meaningful, it takes no particular shape. It's just paint, after all. Just paint. 
 
 `` I do n't know why the music has n't stopped today.'' He says to the red light. The red light does n't respond. `` Ok, now we're going to draw another little figure here as well. Excellent. See how easy it is to draw people. But be careful, it's hard to remove them once they are there.'' 
 
 Bob imagines he's on a ship, pitching in the waves. He's never been on a ship before, but he has painted them. His stomach is turning inside out and he can feel the cold, dead fish he was fed last night wrench itself up into his esophagus. He's rocking like a heaving cat. The jazz music begins to swell, and the delicate twinkle of cymbals electrifies his brain. 
 
 `` Alright, now we're going to use some nice red, and get a little detail. Good. Now once that's done, some white, now the white is for the bones. Beautiful. Now a little circle of brown on top of both of their heads for hair. Lets give them both a beard.'' 
 
 Bob stops painting, and moves off into the blackness of the stage, black in front, black behind, and looks hard at the swirl of colours before him. They're just colours after all. Pull them apart and they are abstract, beautiful, but put them together... 
 
 The scene is a secret copse of healthy, spring-green trees and vivid, living grass. The blue sky stretches the horizon, and the sun beats down on two twisted, groaning figures. One, a man in blue jeans with bushy afro and a neat, trimmed beard is up to his elbows in the entrails and bowels of another man. The figure is stretching the insides of loose intestine, trying to sample the cold, dead fish that the other man was fed the night before. The fishes eyes stare out in wonder as it breaches whole from the intestine, sliding into the other man's mouth. The dying man too has a bushy afro and a beard. His eyes are wide with panic, but he has a gentle smile of relief, as if some calming jazz is playing at his death bed. He is splayed open like a botched operation, and his blood fountains up into the cheerful spring light. The two Bob Ross's, one predator, one prey, one feasting, the other the feast, one open to the wind and the sun with cooling, steaming blood, the other with a mouthful of fish and organ, seem happy. They're both happy with how they wound up. They would n't have it any other way. 
 
 `` That's all for today. Thanks for watching.'' The red light flicks off, but the soft jazz does not stop. Bob hopes it would stop when the red light comes back. Until then he'd have only the painting and the black room to stare at.
"," Adopt the gritty, laconic style of a noir detective, with a dark, atmospheric tone.","The dim stage lights cast long, sinister shadows across the canvas, creating an atmosphere thick with smoke and desperation. Bob Ross, a master of tranquility and serenity, stood amidst the darkness, his eyes burning with an intensity that belied his gentle voice.

""Hello, I'm Bob Ross,"" he began, his voice like honeyed molasses dripping from a spoon. ""Welcome to a very special episode of the joy of painting. Let's paint along, shall we?""

With a swift brushstroke, he splashed emerald green across the canvas, the vibrant color mirroring the bruises beneath a woman's eyes. The music dipped and surged, mirroring the ebb and flow of Bob's emotions.

Something was amiss. A gurgle of stomach bile, a stiffness in his spine, a feeling of dread that settled in his stomach like a cold, dead fish. The music swelled, and Bob felt himself rocking like a distressed ship, his stomach churning in a storm of nausea.

As he painted, the red rings of his eyes sagged, and his small beady eyes strained at the splash of colour. It was as if the paint had consumed him, leaving only the shell of his former self.

""I don't know why the music has stopped today,"" Bob muttered to the red light. The red light remained unmoved, a silent witness to his misery.

""Alright, then. We're going to draw another little figure here as well,"" he said, his voice cracking. ""Excellent. See how easy it is to draw people. But be careful, it's hard to remove them once they are there.""

Bob's stomach lurched, and he imagined he was on a ship, pitching in the waves. The music swelled, and he felt the cold, dead fish he had been served last night being ripped up his esophagus. He was rocking like a drunken cat, his body wracked with nausea and despair."
"`` You're going to make it, honey.'' I can barely hear her voice. She's been saying the same thing for fifteen minutes anyway, holding my hand. It's all starting to fade. Her voice, her hand on mine, her face framed by the flashing lights of oncoming emergency vehicles... all receding into a dark blur. 
 
 A car crash, of all things. I spend all day sending people across the damn Atlantic in a picosecond and I get taken out by a Volvo? That's irony for you. Or not, I do n't even know anymore. I'm sure the papers will have fun with it. Teleporter operator killed by obsolete transportation. 
 
 Shit, I guess I'm the first one to die. At least the teleporters did n't get me. That's not a bad last thought, bleeding out with a chunk of dashboard in my lung. At least they ca n't blame the technology. 
 
 `` You're going to make it, honey,'' she says one more time. I can barely hear it, and I know it's a lie. 
 
 I do n't know what I expected as at all went black. But it certainly was n't what I saw. My hand to God, there were the pearly gates. Pure white expanse, ornate golden fence, the works. I felt like the universe was playing a joke on me. 
 
 Around the gates, a ring of enormous winged men in bronze armor were staring down a massive crowd of... commuters? There were n't nearly as many angels as humans, but flaming swords do a lot to discourage adventurous ideas. A smaller angel with a clipboard was shouting out to the crowd. 
 
 `` Anika Pari! David Hawkins! Bai Song!'' People were cautiously slipping through the crowd toward the gates. Each time, the angel with the clipboard nodded and the warriors let the named human pass through. But the crowd was getting more restless. 
 
 `` We're not just going to stand out here forever!'' yelled a clean-cut executive type. He looked a bit unhinged between his expensive suit in disorder, days of stubble, and a wide-eyed expression. He gestured angrily at the gatekeeper but shrunk back when a few warrior angels glared at him. 
 
 `` Your position is already occupied,'' said the gatekeeper in a weary tone. I got the feeling he had been through this a few times already. `` Management is working on the problem, but for the time being you'll just have to wait. Anaya Patil! Nabil Hajar!'' 
 
 `` That's not going to cut it,'' said another man close to the first. I had a momentary sarcastic thought about how similar business types looked before realizing they were the same person. Now that I was looking, the crowd had quite a few sets of duplicates. They mostly looked well-to-do, wearing expensive business clothing. One strangely familiar woman stood out with fifteen or twenty copies wearing a variety of severely-cut suits. 
 
 Then I recognized her as a frequent teleport traveler and I suddenly realized what was going on. That happened right about when the gatekeeper, studiously ignoring the troublemakers in the crowd, called out, `` Christopher Miller!''. He froze for a moment and then scanned the surrounding mob. All of the warriors were looking around curiously as well. 
 
 For a moment I had a flickering hope that I was about to be on the other side of the gates with Anaya and Habil. I could still see them, emptying their pockets and bags for another group of warriors. Never thought I would be longing to tangle with the celestial TSA. Then the gatekeeper spotted me and his eyes narrowed. 
 
 He picked a few warriors out of the ring of guards and pointed toward me. `` Bring him here.'' I started backing up as they advanced. `` Do you have any idea what you've done?'' the gatekeeper asked. `` Any idea what a mess this has been? Dumping duplicates on our doorstep day after day, without anywhere to put them?'' 
 
 `` We did n't know,'' I said. What else was there to say? `` We had no idea.'' 
 
 `` These are good people!'' the gatekeeper shouted. He was really getting into it, now that he had a target for his frustrations. `` They belong here! Do you know what it's been like, shoving them away from paradise because they're already inside?'' 
 
 It was the woman who suddenly got it. One of her, anyway. I saw the realization dawn on her face just before she pointed and yelled, `` You killed me! You bastard, you killed me eighteen times!'' Suddenly the mob was more interested in me than the ring of feathered soldiers. They flowed around the angels advancing on me, all determined to reach me first. 
 
 `` We'll get this sorted out,'' the gatekeeper said. `` We sorted out Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We sorted out Auschwitz. We sorted out Mao. It may take years, but we'll sort this out. And I'll tell you one thing for sure. You're damned. You, and everyone else who had any part in this, lost any place past these gates you ever had.'' 
 
 I ran. I'm not ashamed to say it. I ran, and ran, and ran. I ran until I could n't run anymore. It seemed unfair, that I would get tired here. That I still had the limitations of stamina even after I had died. But I did, and the mob was close behind. 
 
 Then, just as they closed, I heard a faint beeping. It slowly faded in, and the mob grew faint, and the expanse around me grew dark. The last thing I remember seeing, before it all slipped away like a bad dream, was that woman slashing at me with her car keys. They bit into my hand as I raised it to protect my eyes. And then came an explosion of pain from my chest, so powerful I imagined that I had been shot. 
 
 My eyes fluttered open to see the inside of an ambulance. There was an IV taped onto my hand. My chest was bound up tightly, bandaged around the massive shard of plastic and aluminum embedded in it. That was the pain, I realized. I could see Julie looking down at me along with a woman in the uniform of an EMT. Julie was crying, absently holding a bandaged shoulder. The EMT looked intensely focused, but I saw her relax just a bit when she glanced at a monitor next to me. `` He's coming around,'' she said. 
 
 It took everything I had to look over at my hand, to look at a wound that was fresher than the others - a ragged cut just beginning to bleed out onto the flesh around it. The car keys that gave me that wound stuck in my mind for some reason, blending with other snapshots of the bizarre scene I was still trying to process. Car keys. The security checkpoint, just inside the gates. Flaming swords. And bronze armor. 
 
 And then it clicked, and I chuckled despite the pain. I knew what I had to do. If I made it through this, I knew what I had to do. 
 
 It took months. First convalescence, and then research, and then worming my way into every favor and secret I could find in the secretive ranks of the Quantum Tunneling Transit Administration. But finally, I stood on the room-sized pad of the teleporter I operated day in and day out. Julie was at the controls, running down the checklist I had written on a notepad and walked her through over and over until I was confident she had it down. 
 
 I nervously gripped the assault rifle in my hands. Sweat trickled down my back under the body armor I had stolen from the guard station. Then the smell of ozone filled the air, the beginning of a flash... And suddenly I was in Paris, standing in a roomful of myself. Five hundred copies of me, crammed into the pad chamber, each armed and armored. 
 
 Because that was the secret. The secret that could collapse the world economy as we knew it. The secret they thought was the important one. If we were just duplicating people, there was no reason to stop with one. 
 
 But I knew a more important secret than that, and I was just getting started. One of me opened the operator booth of the Paris chamber and started preparing it to transmit. I had all night to work before the security window closed and I had to be gone. 
 
 So for those long hours, five hundred Christopher Millers died every two seconds. By the time the last batch was annihilated, leaving only a single new copy in the New York chamber with Julie, the eastern sky was beginning to glow outside. As we slipped out of the facility, I felt a glimmer of hope for the first time since I died. 
 
 Because next time, when I die for good, I expect to be shaking my own hand at the gates.
"," Use the minimalist and reflective style of a Zen master, focusing on simplicity and insight.","The world fades into a blur as the ambulance sirens pierce through the air. A car crash, a cruel hand of fate, a fleeting moment of life intertwined with its end. In this fleeting moment, the voice of a loved one echoes through the fading sounds of the world. It's a voice filled with compassion, a voice attempting to soothe the troubled waters of a soul grappling with the abyss.

The thoughts dance like the flames of a fire, consuming everything in their path. Irony, the juxtaposition of life and its end, the absurdity of circumstances, all swirling in the vortex of emotions. The voice fades once more, a final attempt to bridge the chasm between life and death.

In the twilight realm of consciousness, the pearly gates materialize, a mirage amidst the fading light. The angels, guardians of the celestial realm, their eyes etched with wisdom and compassion, welcome those who have crossed the threshold.

Yet, amidst the grandeur, there is a sense of unease. The winged warriors guard the gates with an unwavering intensity, their swords glinting like weapons of war. The angel with the clipboard, a keeper of names and fate, whispers the names of the deceased into the ears of the warriors.

The crowd gathers, a mix of fear, desperation, and acceptance. Each person, a traveler on the cosmic stage, grapples with their own mortality. The executive, his voice laced with anger and desperation, seeks to challenge the forces of fate but is met with the unyielding resolve of the angels.

In this moment of transition, the boundaries between life and death dissolve. The egoistic concerns of the living fade away, replaced by a profound sense of interconnectedness and acceptance. The final breath, a sigh into the abyss, a release of the burdens of the past, a surrender to the mystery of the future."

"Two blurry colors were making zig zag motions around the city. One is yellow and the other red. The yellow one seemed to be ahead of the red one. It was Eobard Thawne and Barry Allen running against each other. The city seemed like it stood still in time compared to how fast these two were moving. 
 
 Barry was trying his best but he just ca n't seem to keep up. He thought he'd done everything right. He gave away everything he possessed to charity and anyone else who needed it. He had nothing except for the suit on his body. But how come he's still slower than his foe. Could it be? Thawne is somehow more destitute than him? But how? He's at zero. Could it be that Thawne owned someone money? No, Barry has already tried that. He took a loan and got himself in debt to see if he got faster before he got into this fight and he did n't. The maximum power you can get from this power scheme is when you have nothing. Debts does n't account into it. But- 
 
 Thawne saw Barry's confusion and took the advantage and swung at Barry hard. The Flash could n't react in time and got hit. It was a powerful punch. One of his teeth came off and Barry was thrown of course hard. He spun on the ground for several cycles and could n't stop himself. 
 
 `` Do you want to know why you're losing, Barry? You can feel it, do n't you? You're getting slower.'' said Thawne gleefully. Barry was in pain but he can still see how smug Thawne is. He was right though. He does feel more lethargic. What's happening? Barry is at his poorest, he ca n't be slowing down. Did Thawne do something? 
 
 `` Look at your pocket, Barry.'' taunted the man in yellow. Barry was confused but did what Thawne told him to do anyway. There was something in pocket. Odd. It was paper. Barry hastily tore it out of his pocket and looked at it. It was a lottery ticket. Dated today. 
 
 `` It's the winning lottery, Barry'' smiled Thawne. `` You're rich now!'' 
 
 `` How-'' 
 
 `` It was me all along, Barry! Me!'' Thawne was hysterical at this point.
"," Adopt the hopeful and determined tone of a pioneer, facing the unknown with resilience.","Two colors danced across the city, like the windblown leaves of a storm. One, yellow, trailed the other, red, like a coyote tracking its prey. The city stood still in comparison to the speed of the two warriors, Eobard Thawne and Barry Allen, who raced against each other, their strides leaving behind a sonic boom.

Barry fought hard, but he just couldn't keep up. He had given away everything he had to the needy, leaving himself with nothing but his suit. But he had tried everything he could to gain speed. He had taken a loan and gotten himself in debt, hoping that it would give him the edge he needed. But it was not meant to be. Thawne saw Barry's confusion and took advantage, landing a powerful punch that sent the Flash reeling.

As Thawne gloated, Barry felt his strength waning. He knew he was losing, but he couldn't accept it. He felt as if he was at his poorest, his speed dwindling with every passing moment. Could it be that Thawne had done something to him? He looked at his pocket and found a lottery ticket, dated today. It was the winning ticket.

Thawne smiled triumphantly, his eyes gleaming. ""It's the winning lottery, Barry,"" he sneered. ""You're rich now!""

Barry was stunned. He couldn't believe his eyes. ""How-"" he whispered.

""It was me all along, Barry,"" Thawne boasted, his voice dripping with honeyed sweetness. ""Me!""

Thawne's victory was short-lived. As he reached to grab Barry, a gust of wind swept through the city, carrying with it the scent of victory and despair. The wind carried Barry away, leaving Thawne standing alone in the middle of the street, his dream shattered."
"`` Edward, do you want some bread?'' my grandmother asked. 
 
 `` No, thank you, grandma,'' I answered. 
 
 The door opened and I looked over across the hallway from the dinner table. A thin man, about my age, who looked something like me, but a much better looking version, entered through the door and closed it behind him. He wore a nice button up shirt, with designer jeans, a leather belt, and dress shoes. He looked like me, but photo-shopped. That's because he was. 
 
 `` Ah,'' grandma said, `` Eddie is here. Hello Eddie!'' 
 
 `` Hey, grandma,'' Eddie said from the foyer, removing his shoes. 
 
 He walked into the dinning room and took the empty seat at the table. Grandma stood up, taking some plates with her. `` Boys, I'm going to watch Mr. Swayze dance dirty. You boys stay out of trouble tonight.'' 
 
 `` Ok, grandma,'' we said in unison. I look at Eddie with scorn, he grinned back at me. 
 
 `` Oh yes, and boys,'' grandma called back from the kitchen. `` Do n't forget to use condoms if you go out tonight!'' 
 
 I rolled my eyes in awkward embarrassment. Eddie shouted back through the house, `` Of course, grandma! Magnums!'' 
 
 `` Oh, you!'' grandma laughed from the hallway. 
 
 I felt myself starting to blush. Eddie looked up at me, `` Calm down, Edward. You should relax. She's pretty cool. You'd know that if you let yourself find out.'' 
 
 I slammed my fist on the table, irate. `` Relax?! Relax, Eddie? How are you so calm. This is weird. Very weird.'' 
 
 `` It's not so weird for me, Edward. It's actually normal for me. It's 100 % of the life I've ever known. All three days of it.'' He ate a piece of bread and scooped some green beans onto his empty plate while he talked. 
 
 `` Well let me tell you,'' I said angrily. `` I've been around for 17 years, and I know normal. This is not normal.'' 
 
 `` Well then why did you make me, Edward?'' he asked calmly. 
 
 `` You know why,'' I retorted. 
 
 `` Right, right,'' he said. I could n't tell if he was dejected, or insulted, or just emotionless. `` Online dating profile. I got it.'' 
 
 He finished his dinner and looked at me. He grabbed my plate and carried it into the kitchen and came back. `` Wan na go score some chicks, bro?'' 
 
 `` No, *bro*'' I said, `` I do not want to go'score some chicks.''' 
 
 `` Right, that's what you made me for,'' he said poignantly. `` Alright, then. I'll go then.'' 
 
 `` This is so fucked up!'' I yelled. 
 
 `` Just think of it this way,'' Eddie said as he started putting his shoes on, `` One day, a chick I bang out there is going to think you're me. Just without a shower, or just'dressed-down' or something. And if you lose that awkward anger thing you've got going on, you'll be able to lay her. That's what you made me for right? To make chicks think you're me so you can bang them?'' 
 
 I was fuming so much I could n't even look at him. He closed the door behind him and left. I went back to my room and created a photoshop of myself that was more beat up, more acne-riddled, shorter, fatter. Maybe if this one comes to life, I'll look good compared to it, instead of being the black sheep of my own imagination.
"," Channel the spontaneous, free-flowing style of the Beat Generation writers, incorporating jazz-inspired rhythm and a spirit of rebellion.","The scent of fresh bread and the aroma of the evening meal lingered in the air as I sat across from Eddie, my grandmother's guest. The doorway swung open, and he entered, his entrance punctuated by a cascade of jazz-infused rhythm. He was a vision in his designer clothes, a stark contrast to my humble appearance.

My grandmother's smile widened upon seeing him, and she greeted him with a warm embrace. As he settled into the table, I felt my anger rising. His nonchalant attitude and carefree grin mocked me, and I couldn't contain my frustration. The atmosphere crackled with a sense of rebellion and defiance.

My grandmother's humor, as always, injected a moment of levity into the situation. Her advice on safe sex was met with a groan, and I couldn't resist rolling my eyes in embarrassment. Eddie's response, ""Of course, grandma! Magnums!"" sent her into a fit of laughter.

I was consumed by a wave of anger and resentment. How could he be so calm and collected in the face of my discomfort? I slammed my fist on the table, my frustration boiling over. But Eddie remained unfazed, his composure unwavering.

He spoke of his life, his meager existence, and his unwavering resilience. I listened to his stories, my anger fading as I began to understand his perspective. His words painted a vivid picture of a life lived in the margins, a world where normalcy was elusive.

The conversation continued, but I was no longer consumed by my anger. I began to see the humanity in Eddie, and I felt a sense of empathy for his plight. As the night came to an end, I watched him leave, and I felt a wave of relief.

In the aftermath of that encounter, I realized that my perception of normal had been skewed. Eddie's unconventional lifestyle challenged me to question my assumptions and to understand the complexities of human experience. It was a lesson learned through the lens of the Beat Generation, a testament to the transformative power of empathy and understanding."
"The `` Multiverse Theory'' in its formation created this universe, and I was not too disturbed by it. I was the `` Fountainhead'' of universe creation, entering each new universe created by the possibility of its existence and checking it for errors. It was much like being God. 
 
 The Batman-to-One universe, where everyone is Batman ( except you ) is really quite an experience. There are so many Batmen, that upon your entering, you are immediately grapple-hooked and beaten. That's because only one Batman is truly Batman, even in this existence of remote possibility. 
 
 The real test was finding the error in it all, therefore destroying it and ending the suffering of less-than-Batmen in the universe. I've killed multitude universe; but I am not God. I am not human, as he is. I could not create a universe, splitting the original creation as possibilities unfold, giving free will to everyone. I could only join each universe and travel in and out of them. I could also destroy them. 
 
 This universe is where fake Batmen lived and suffered, all unknowing they were not the Real Batman, and where *you* can exist as yourself and not Batman. I saw it as an abomination created out of the minds of Mad Physicists, and God said, `` You must destroy it.'' 
 
 `` But first, I must find the error rendering it impossible...'' 
 
 And then it hit me. If Batman entered this universe ( which there was the remotest possibility of ever happening ), there would be two Real Batmen in the universe according to this universe created by the Multiverse Theory. 
 
 There could only be one. 
 
 **Bang. **
"," Use the expressive and emotional style of a romantic poet, full of passion and natural imagery.","In a cosmic tapestry woven by the Multiverse Theory, a tale unfolds, a tale of a cosmic fountainhead, a master of creation, and the profound revelation of a flawed universe.

The multiverse, a cosmic canvas splashed with infinite possibilities, birthed this universe, as vibrant as a rainbow after a storm. The fountainhead, a celestial architect, entered each newly created universe, meticulously scrutinizing its intricate design, its flaws, and its potential for suffering. It was a divine act, akin to breathing life into an ethereal tapestry.

The Batman-to-One universe, shrouded in shadows and bathed in the reflection of countless Batmen, is an experience that grips the senses. Here, the illusion of heroism masks the truth, leaving one grappling with the realization that only one Batman reigns supreme, regardless of the multitude that exist. To find the error, to destroy this mockery of creation, was the ultimate test, a task that demanded unwavering determination and compassion.

With each universe destroyed, the fountainhead felt a sense of relief, but not satisfaction. They understood that they were not God, not human, but a traveler, a destroyer, a weaver of cosmic tales. The act of creation, splitting the original creation into countless possibilities, was beyond their reach. Yet, they embraced their role, joining each universe and traversing through its ephemeral existence.

In this universe, where fake Batmen danced in a symphony of suffering, the fountainhead saw an abomination born from the minds of mad physicists. They felt a divine imperative to destroy it, to alleviate the pain of the innocent. And in a moment of epiphany, the error unfolded before their eyes. If Batman entered this universe, there would be two Real Batmen, a contradiction that shattered the very foundation of the multiverse.

With a decisive stroke, the fountainhead unleashed their power and eradicated the flawed universe, bringing solace to countless Batmen. They knew that their journey, though arduous, had a profound purpose - to bring balance to the cosmic dance, to ensure that the true spirit of Batman, compassion and unwavering strength, would endure the test of time."
"With everything finally in order, it was time to have one last shot at making life beautiful again. `` Why even try?'' he thought to himself for what seemed to be the thousandth time that month. As hope seemed to fade into twilight, and a smile always a breath away, John had given up. He knew he was n't going to be one of those irresponsible people that made a rash decision and called it quits, leaving sadness and debt in his wake. He was going to do this right; and so he planned. His struggles surely were not from a lack of trying. At the very least he could hold onto that thought until the end. After trying for years to battle past his descending mind, he had finally gotten his life in order. The passing eyes continually reaffirmed that he was successful in every avenue he chose, but it was never the pair that mattered; his own. For every long forgotten friend that he ran into saying `` You look great, John!'' and wanting to know how he managed to stay single, he truly was doing great. He could never tell them the real answer to their question though. How could he possibly bring another person into his life if he was n't sure he was going to continue living it? It always came down to just another person he would eventually disappoint. Choosing to leave as small a wake as possible, he turned away from those he feared would get too close. 
 
 Today marked his final stand. One last shot at trying to see the sunrise as a welcoming sight. With his finances taken care of, and relationships closed on a good note, he knew he was finally free to make any decision that he chose. It was a freeing feeling, one he knew would be fleeing as soon as tomorrow. Bucket list waiting on his dresser, John woke up and lit the cigarette that had been in his desk drawer for twenty years, thinking, `` Today may finally be a good day.''
"," Present the essay in the style of existentialist philosophy, questioning the nature of existence, freedom, and choice.","The existentialist philosophy permeates the narrative of John's descent into despair and his subsequent liberation through self-destruction. Through the lens of existentialism, we delve into the intricate interplay between existence, freedom, and choice.

John's existential angst stems from his recognition of the absurdity of his existence. He questions the meaning of his being, finding solace in the illusion of order and control. However, this facade cracks as he grapples with the realization that his success and superficial relationships offer little true satisfaction. The burden of authenticity and freedom weighs heavily on his psyche, leading him to conclude that his life is ultimately meaningless.

In an attempt to rectify his perceived failures, John adopts a fatalistic attitude. He believes that his destiny is to leave a small wake, regardless of the consequences. He disengages from meaningful connections, isolating himself in a self-destructive cycle. The fleeting validation of his accomplishments provides little comfort in the face of his impending demise.

Yet, amidst his despair, John finds a glimmer of freedom. He recognizes that his choices are ultimately his own, and he chooses to embrace the uncertainty that lies ahead. He acknowledges the fleeting nature of his liberation, but finds solace in the possibility of making a positive impact on the world.

In a final act of defiance, John indulges in self-destruction, leaving behind a legacy of loss and tragedy. His self-destruction is not merely a physical act but a symbolic representation of his existential surrender. Through his final act, John challenges the boundaries of conventional existence, leaving an indelible mark on the tapestry of time.

In the end, John's journey is a testament to the existentialist struggle between freedom, choice, and the meaning of existence. His story serves as a cautionary tale about the perils of self-destruction and the boundless potential for human transformation."

 `` I can hear you trying to sneak by.'' 
 
 For a moment Phil thought he got lucky. His bosses chair was turned around, facing the window. He figured he could tip-toe past his bosses office undetected so he could meet his girlfriend for lunch fifteen minutes early. 
 
 `` I.. I'm sorry Mr. Crawford.'' Phil stammered. Mr. Crawford spun his fully adjustable leather chair around, revealing steepled fingers and a sly, closed-lip smile. Mr. Crawford had been given a nickname for his strict deadlines, unforgiving adherence for reprimand, and the general super-villain-esque way he carried himself around the office. They called him `` Doctor Doom.'' Just like the comic book villain. At some point it became abbreviated to just `` Doom.'' 
 
 Doom sniffed the air and gave a quick glance over Phil's blatantly guilty and unnerved posture. He then stared Phil in the eyes, and his grin got slightly larger. 
 
 `` That's the same atrocious tie you wore last time you tried to sneak out early.'' 
 
 Doom spoke with his usual confident and nonfluctuating tone. His mild southern accent would be a great voice for radio, had he not inspired so much conditioned terror in his conversational counterparts. 
 
 `` Tell me, where is it this time? Banking errand? You want to beat the Friday lunch lines? Hmm... No. Fidgety Phil, you've been working on the Wilson account all morning, a big account NO? Normally your nervous little fingers would have plied patterns in your miserable excuse of an'Ivy league' crew. But no, your hair is styled, styled like you spent office time fixing it in the washroom, yes? And that smell, you wreak of bathtub cologne, and your Walmart brand shoes are shined for once; tell me, did you tip our poor shoe-shining Joe this morning, or did you stiff him, like you're about to stiff me out of 15 minutes so you can make it your date on time?'' 
 
 `` I.. I was going to stay 15 minutes late at the end of the day s-sir. My girlfriend told me that she was having a rough day, sir.'' Phil's put his hands in his pockets and submissively stared at the ground. 
 
 `` Yes. I'm sure you will stay late tonight... Phil, do you know why your lunch is between 12:00 and 12:30? It's because that is when I need you to take lunch. If I was to have an emergency at 11:50, and our client needed an answer to an important question that only you knew, how would we proceed?'' 
 
 `` You could call my cell-phone, sir.'' 
 
 `` Ah. Of course. So when we call and you say that you need to see the file to answer his question, and you're at the Cactus club, or whatever rube restaurant makes you feel like you're back on in small-town Virginia, you'll come right back I assume? So maybe you pay the waiter and get the food to go, but Friday's are busy, so you're out of there when? 12:03? Then nine minutes return, assuming the elevators are n't busy with the traffic of honest, hard-working employees on their real lunchbreak. Now our client has been waiting 30 minutes for his answer and you have missed your opportunity to pacify your girlfriends fragile sensibilities.'' 
 
 `` I. Well, I just figured I made good progress this morning on the Wilson account I could maybe go do something for my g-'' 
 
 `` **NO**, your progress is circumstantial and your excuses are ad hoc. The pestering little whims that circle through your head have made you their slave Phil. You are a slave to little buzzes of immediate gratification and helping yourself to company time. I see you taking extra coffee breaks and fooling around with Pam at reception when there is still work to be done.'' 
 
 `` And this'consoling' you will be doing for your girlfriend, that fifteen minutes will help you do it? Or maybe you need the time for something else, maybe you need to visit the bar first, have a little shot for courage?......... Oh do n't respond Phil, your employer just accused you of drinking on the job. It's not a secret or anything, your hands have been shaking since you got here this morning, and you spilled your coffee already. Tell me, what else did you spill? Perhaps on one of your frequent bathroom breaks you took one of those tacky little airport liquor bottles, maybe one or three? And your hands, that shake, your nervous little ticks.. I guess you have enough cologne to cover up the smell though, yes?'' 
 
 Phil's face turned red, and his lips quivered into a painful grimace as he choked back anxious tears. `` I'm.. Sir, please. I need this job.'' 
 
 `` Yes, I know you do. You are 23 and in your first job ever, no? I saw your transcripts, outstanding post-secondary, bravo! But your high school grades were not so great, were they? You did n't get offered a scholarship did you? So Ma and Pa worked their land dead and pinched their pennies so you could go, but it was n't enough was it? Yale is a pricey school. You had a loan, which put you under considerable debt, did n't you? You could n't let your parents down and live with the guilt of breaking their bank for nothing, so you studied hard, too hard to party on the weekends, yes? Where does one like you find the time to develop an alcohol problem, hmm Phil?...'' 
 
 `` Sir, I'm. I do n't -'' 
 
 `` Yes. I know you do n't have a problem Phil. Not an alcohol problem anyway. You just have an anxiety problem... By now I've realized that your mind has n't been on the job this last little bit, but why? You're ridiculous tie, atypical shoe shine and fanciful hair styling betray your delicate, anxious compulsions, your need for static routine... Today you planned on leaving 15 minutes early for lunch for a total of a 45 minute lunch break, but downtown on a Friday you could easily be held up 30 minutes just waiting for a table. Tell me Phil, she does n't need consoling, does she? This is n't a spontaneously planned comfort lunch, is it?... Where is your reservation?'' Without breaking eye-contact, Doom's head pointed down slightly and his smile grew, as he stared at Phil in anticipation. 
 
 `` C-c-c-chez Marko's'' 
 
 `` I see. And that bulge in your pocket. It's an engagement ring, no?... How many months salary did you spend on it? Three? Sure, you spent three-months salary on it. You're a classy grass-roots boy Phil, with a strong compass to familial value. It's probably shaped like her favorite animal, you'd be attracted to a caring type, it's in your bones, Phil. Please, let me see it?'' 
 
 Dumbfounded by Doom's remarkable accuracy, and afraid for his job, he pulled out the red velvet box and diffidently placed it on the desk. 
 
 `` Open it boy, I'm not going to touch your girlfriends engagement ring.'' 
 
 Phil opened the box with his paint-shaker hands. 
 
 `` Cat's eyes... Yes. I like cats too. You know I am within my power to fire you right now, with all that booze spilled on your shirt. Stealing company time... Do you know what the greatest display of power is Phil?'' 
 
 `` W-wrath sir.'' 
 
 `` No, Phil. Forgiveness. I can ruin your life today. If I fired you right now, how do you think your $ 150 engagement lunch would go over? You think your ailurophile wants to marry an unemployed debt-ridden farm boy?...'' 
 
 Phil stared, dumbfounded by the direction this conversation had gone in and Doom's almost clairvoyant insight. 
 
 ``'Ailurophile', that's a cat lover, Phil. You think your cat loving girlfriend would like it if you were fired?.... So I have your entire life in my hands right now. I can fire you and watch it crumble. Or I can forgive you. That's the trick, I do n't even need to fire you. That's how much control I have. You have broken several company policies just today, but I can let it slide without even worrying it's not the right decision. I am absolute power.'' 
 
 Doom steepled his hands again and paused a few seconds. He then removed his tie and placed it on the table. He then opened his drawer and grabbed a bottle of aged scotch and two glasses, pouring into them. 
 
 `` Take off that dreadful tie, Phil. This one is Versace. A man must be presentable when meeting his future bride. Skip the bar, take a swig of this. 13 year old scotch. It traveled for 13 years to get here today, the day of your engagement. 13 years. Oh 13 is only bad luck if you have fear, and you just came face-to-face with fear and stood your ground. Do n't let the ploy fool you, dear Phil, Doom is not such an apropos moniker for me, though I do enjoy the perception it yields in my staff...'' 
 
 Phil's hands stopped shaking. He glanced at his watch, 11:51. He still had time to make his date. He downed the drink, and quickly fixed his tie. 
 
 `` I assume that after your girlfriend says yes, you wo n't need to spend so much company time confiding with Pam at reception any more? And your excessive coffee breaks will be cut back, since you can focus on work again, yes? Maybe you'll focus so hard you'll impress us one day, earn yourself a little promotion, yes?'' 
 
 `` No. I mean yes. I meant no more wasted time and Yes to hard, err harder work Mist-'' 
 
 `` Do n't come back until Monday Phil, take the afternoon off, I'll make sure payroll does n't dock your salary. Mush along now Phil, you do n't want to be late. Mush away.'' Doom spun his chair back around so it faced his window. He heard Phil's quick steps bolt out of the room. 
 
 `` Thankyou Mr. Crawford!'' 
 
 Doom would enjoy the omniscient perception Phil would have of him thenceforth, even if it was largely due to the two sharing the bathroom while Phil recited his proposal speech in the mirror, thinking he was alone. 
 
 Doom looked at his clock. He still had 7 minutes before the lunch break at 12:00. So once again, back turned to his door, he recited, 
 
 `` I can hear you trying to sneak by.'' He waited another thirty seconds. 
 
 `` I can hear you trying to sneak by.'' 
 
 `` I can hear you trying to sneak by.''

"," Use Twain's humorous and satirical style, with a focus on American culture and vernacular speech.","The office had a rhythm, a symphony of keyboards clicking, pens scratching, and phones ringing. But for Phil, the rhythm was more like a cacophony of his own impending doom. He'd been playing a dangerous game, attempting to sneak away early to meet his girlfriend for lunch. His boss, Mr. Crawford, had a reputation, one that earned him the nickname ""Doctor Doom."" And right now, Phil was facing the consequences.

Mr. Crawford, a man of formidable stature and a smile that could curdle milk, was known for his strict deadlines and unforgiving reprimands. His office, a testament to his power, was shrouded in an aura of impending doom. Phil, his face pale with fear, knew he was caught red-handed.

""I can hear you trying to sneak by,"" Mr. Crawford sneered, his voice dripping with honeyed menace. ""I'm sorry, Mr. Crawford,"" Phil stammered, his voice cracking like a thin ice cream cone. But Mr. Crawford's smile widened, revealing his pearly whites.

""That's the same atrocious tie you wore last time you tried to sneak out early,"" Mr. Crawford remarked, his tone unwaveringly confident. ""Tell me, where is it this time? Banking errand? You want to beat the Friday lunch lines? No, Fidgety Phil, you've been working on the Wilson account all morning, a big account NO?""

With a snicker, Mr. Crawford began to dissect Phil's appearance, commenting on his hair, his shoes, and his cologne. Phil, his confidence shattered, began to plead, but Mr. Crawford was not listening. He was too busy savoring the sweet taste of Phil's humiliation.

In the end, Phil was left alone in his chair, his dreams of a leisurely lunch shattered. Mr. Crawford's voice echoed through the office, ""I'm sorry, Mr. Crawford,"" but it was a voice too late to offer any solace. The damage had been done, and Phil was the victor in this round of office warfare."

 ^The ^National ^Reddit ^Times ^| ^ [ RyanKinder ] ( /u/RyanKinder ) ^| ^March ^20, ^2015 
 
 Most people across the city were not doing anything particularly exceptional that morning 7 months ago. Most people, like Reddit native [ ScrotalImplosion ] ( /u/scrotalimplosion ), or Scrotal -- as he likes to be called, were going about their daily routines that fateful morning. This is how ScrotalImplosion ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time, unknowingly dragging him into one of the greatest schemes to hit the nation. He's been in police protection for 6 or the last 7 months. NRTimes is the first interview he has given since the day of the incident. For our international readers not familiar with recent events in Reddit, it may first help to understand Scrotal's history living in the wider Reddit Metropolitan Area 
 
 As a small child, Scrotal grew up in quieter, low-crime districts, like [ HSC ] ( https: //www.reddit.com//r/hardscience ) and [ UPN ] ( https: //www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews ). That all changed, however, in 2004 when the Global Karma Markets collapsed under the immense weight of rampant fraud and corruption from key industry players like [ Q & Meme Sachs ] ( http: //www.dailydot.com/business/reddit-quickmeme-banned-miltz-brothers/ ). In its wake, everyday people like Scrotal suddenly lacked content and were forced to move to places much closer to the heart of Reddit where content is cheaper and traffic is louder and overcrowded: the Default, as the city's elected Moderators euphemistically like to call it. `` We [ most people ] know it as the shithouse,'' says an anxious-sounding Scrotal jokingly over the phone, `` but these are my subs, and that's where I feel safe right now.'' I agree to meet him at a coffeeshop in the [ ADVA Projects ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/ ), a sub so left in decay and marred by the malpractices of QS & Meme Co. that the Moderator Council eventually removed its rank as part of the Default, in an attempt to avoid negative publicity and instead highlight better-maintained districts. Now, order and the long arm of the Reddiquette are hard to maintain here in this overpopulated, and largely unnoticed community. Redditors here travel in packs and identify by sub, coming into frequent contact with neighboring Default subs. With alarming regularity, whole community-wide vendettas are exacted by rival gangs from the ADVA Projects, AW & W, FNY Heights, and PCS subs ( to name a few ). 
 
 Welcome to the home of ScrotalImplosion. In the years since arriving to Default, Scrotal has grown a thicker skin and become a regular in these urban subs. But even all that could not prepare him for what he was about to witness the day of the incident. As it happens, I met Scrotal at Jose's on Kermit Blvd. and became the first person outside of a courtroom to learn of what really happened. I later learned it was no coincidence that we met in ADVA projects. We were within earshot of everything, and Scrotal wanted me to see with my own eyes the aftermath of what happened, in the event he gets marked and receives a visit from the man he fears. Below I have preserved in as much detail as possible, the text of our 45 minute conversation in the hope that it will put an end to the hunt.

"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","Ladies and Gentlemen, my dear audience, tonight, I bring you a tale woven with threads of greed, politics, and corruption. A story that will have you gripping your seats and begging for more.

Picture this: It was a fateful morning, 7 months ago, when fate intertwined the life of a humble Reddit native named ScrotalImplosion, with one of the greatest schemes to hit the nation. Like a moth drawn to a flame, he found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, unknowingly becoming a player in this intricate game of deception.

Scrotal, as I like to call him, was a child of quieter, low-crime districts. But fate took a cruel turn in 2004, when the Global Karma Markets crashed down, leaving him bereft of content. Forced to move closer to the heart of Reddit, he found himself in the Default, a place shrouded in darkness and chaos.

But fear not, my dear audience, for I have a story to tell of redemption and resilience. Through the cracks of the corruption, Scrotal emerged, a beacon of light in a sea of darkness. With courage and determination, he fought back against the forces of greed and corruption, bringing hope to the people of Reddit.

So, let us applaud the bravery of this young man, who dared to stand tall against a tide of corruption. May his story serve as a testament to the power of even the smallest individual to make a positive impact on the world. Thank you, my dear audience."
"Dear Diary, I know its been a while but please forgive me. Earlier today when walking home from school I had a strange, no, the strangest thing that has ever happened to me happened today and I am totally freaking out. I was crossing Squash Creek on the north bridge like I do everyday after class. But this time when I approached the on ramp I noticed a small wooden stool sitting in the path. it was n't until I tried walking around it did I notice the..thing, I do n't know what to call it a troll maybe? Yeah, a troll that makes sense. I met a troll today. At first I though it was some crude creation of some meth tweakers made of dead cats and fish but then this harry, scalie thing turned to me and gave me a grin. I was so taken back that I fell on my ass right there. If not for that I would have been out of there instantly, and the fact that this thing started to speak to me..'' Easy there young-en!'' it said in a disturbingly human voice `` Where be you off to in such a hurry''? Naturally I answered it. I spoke back to the `` troll'', I must have been in shock still. `` I was just trying to cross here, I do it almost every day''. It was silent for a moment after that then replied `` You see son, this is my bridge now''! `` And you cross it on my terms''. He stuck some sort of crooked cane in my face as I started to get up to my feet. `` You must answer my riddle'' he choked out with a laugh. This was the point where I was convinced I had gone absolutely bonkers. I literally pinched myself which only aided in his laughter. `` What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence''? he said in a slow majestic voice. How was I supposed to know that? It was probably some ancient proverb or great life lesson I had never heard of..I tried reasoning with the thing but it would n't have any. I had to answer it..otherwise I would have to walk four miles to the other crossing. Yeah right. I sat there for about twenty minutes watching it shoo flies away until I had settled on an answer. it never told me what would happen if I was wrong in my reply... I opened my mouth to speak `` What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence''? I repeated. `` Its time to buy a new fence'' I said confidently. The trolls face showed no emotion until he suddenly erupted in laughter, he even fell off his stupid stool. Was I right I thought to myself. I then decided that while he mocks my wrong answer I was n't going to take any of that. I ran. I ran fast and did n't turn back. Now I'm recording it all. Should I tell my parents? What if it followed me? Was my answer right? I'm not even sure it actually happened..
", Embrace Tolstoy's broad scope and deep exploration of philosophical questions through detailed narrative.,"My Dearest Diary, forgive me for my tardiness. It has been a while, yet I write to you with a tale of the extraordinary that occurred earlier this day. As I traversed the north bridge over Squash Creek, a confluence of destiny unfolded before me, casting me into a realm of bewilderment and terror. The mundane ritual of crossing the bridge had been shattered by a surreal encounter that would forever etch itself into my memory.

As I approached the ramp leading onto the bridge, a peculiar sight caught my eye. A small wooden stool, seemingly innocuous, stood stubbornly in the path. However, as I attempted to circumvent it, a sinister force unveiled itself. It was as if a grotesque creation, born of meth and despair, had materialized before me. My heart skipped a beat, and my knees buckled beneath me. The creature, a troll of monstrous proportions, grinned maliciously, his eyes gleaming with an unsettling intensity.

I stood frozen in terror, my mind reeling from the surreal scene. The troll's voice, deep and menacing, echoed through the bridge. ""Easy there, young-en,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with honeyed menace. ""Where be you off to in such a hurry?"" My answer was met with silence, the only sound being the troll's relentless laughter. As I attempted to flee, he clamped his crooked cane on my face, his voice dripping with disdain. ""You must answer my riddle,"" he commanded.

I was at a loss for words. How was I to know the answer to such a riddle? It was as if I had been transported to a realm where logic and reason were suspended, replaced by the whims of a deranged troll. I sat there for what felt like an eternity, watching the troll dance and torment me. Finally, as the sun began to dip behind the trees, I gathered my strength and began to reason with the creature. But my pleas were met with indifference. The troll's laughter echoed through the bridge, mocking my attempts to find solace.

In the end, I had no choice but to answer his riddle. My mind raced as I searched for the answer, my thoughts running wild. Finally, I uttered the answer, a profound proverb I had never heard before. The troll's eyes lit up with joy, and he exclaimed, ""You have done well, young man.""

I stood up, my body trembling, and walked away, leaving the troll behind. As I walked away, I couldn't shake the feeling that I had been witness to a fleeting glimpse into the abyss of madness and the illusory nature of reality."
"It was time. We all took our places in the ritual circle underneath the starlit sky, while the old medicine lady chanted and sang in the middle. Each person eagerly awaited their transformation. 
 
 As the moon reached its apex, slowly, everyone began to change. Skin grew hairier, teeth grew sharper, eyes grew wilder. Everyone began changing into the spirit animals they saw in their visions. 
 
 Well, everyone except me, that is. 
 
 As my friends changed into wolves, eagles, bears, snakes, they all saw that I retained my human form. A few laughed at me and mocked for being stuck in this pitiful existence. Some pitied me for not being able to experience the new freedom and strength that came with a new form. Others looked at me with revulsion, and considered me unworthy and unclean. One by one, as each one completed the transformation, they slipped into the night. 
 
 The old lady shook her head at me and sighed, suggesting that perhaps I did n't pray hard enough. Her eyes were filled with frustration and pity. Yes, I'll try again next year; yes, I'll bring a better offering; yes, I'll pray more fervently; and all that stuff. 
 
 I ca n't say that I was too disappointed by my lack of transformation, though. I was n't exactly distressed. 
 
 I *am* a shapeshifter, after all.

We all took our positions in the ritual circle beneath the starlit sky, the medicine lady's chant echoing through the night. A palpable anticipation permeated the air as each person eagerly awaited their metamorphosis.

As the moon reached its zenith, the transformation began. Skin grew hairier, teeth sharpened, eyes widened. Everyone embraced their spirit animals, be it the swift grace of the eagle, the raw power of the bear, the cunning stealth of the snake. All except me.

I stood amidst my transformed companions, a spectator to their newfound freedom and strength. While they danced with their newfound forms, I remained unchanged. A few scoffed and sneered, mocking my human confines. Others expressed pity, their voices dripping with empathy. Still others looked at me with disgust, their disdain palpable. One by one, as each individual completed their metamorphosis, they slipped into the night, leaving me behind.

The medicine lady shook her head, her eyes filled with frustration and pity. She whispered that perhaps my prayers had been inadequate, suggesting I should have offered more, prayed harder. Yes, I'll try again next year; yes, I'll bring a better offering; yes, I'll pray more fervently. And all that jazz. But I couldn't say I was overly disappointed by my lack of transformation. I *am* a shapeshifter, after all."
"They camped out along a little creek and after Alrick stamped the fire out they embraced by the sound of it and held each other all the night and said what they felt and the night passed much faster than any before it. She looked at him in the new daylight as he lashed the bedroll onto his pack small and bent in the dirt and she thought of things unsaid that she had held back and would forever. 
 
 “ Where are you going to in the north? ” 
 
 “ More war, I think. ” 
 
 “ Why? ” 
 
 “ I met a boy at the feast, a ward of Lord Atley, he will be a King one day I think, of his birth lands or elsewhere. ” 
 
 “ Elsewhere? ” 
 
 “ Yes, he ’ s hardly grown, but you can see it entire in him. He is one of those rare ones so marked. ” 
 
 “ So you ’ ll leave all of us behind to follow some boy just to see if you ’ re right. ” 
 “ I must start if I want to find out; come along with me a little ways down the road before we part. ” 
 
 “ Fine. ” 
 
 The road continued through the woods and they walked with no great hurry. Soon they reached the end of the forest and the road came out and went onwards into the north marches and the hill lands beyond. This seemed to be a place natural to say farewell and they turned to one another and she looked into his brown eyes and felt her own water. Suddenly he looked past her. 
 
 “ What ’ s that? ” 
 
 She turned and Alrick went by her towards a glint of some object behind a dead trunk. He reached behind it and drew into view another pack, full laden, and lashed to the side of it her sword. She smiled. 
 
 “ I think I ’ m right because I have seen another with that same inner ability, and many followed her because they saw it shine as natural as the sun. He will need us both to survive the wars upcountry. Come, we are two days from his camp and you are much anticipated there. ” 
 
 She shouldered her new pack and they continued on wordlessly across a great plain and by day ’ s end had climbed atop the first hill of many to come and looked out as night fell onto a land unknown to them both and she felt somewhere deep that she could from that vista see the bounds of the remainder of her days.

Legend has it that Merlin's power rivaled that of the most potent dragon, and his teachings could guide Gareth through the treacherous path that lay ahead.

But fate took a cruel turn, and the treacherous spirit Morgana sought to exploit Gareth's newfound powers for her own selfish gain. Infused with supernatural strength, Morgana cast a spell, summoning a formidable entity known as the Spirit of Wrath. This dreaded spirit, with its fiery eyes and menacing aura, sought to bend Gareth to its will.

Yet, Gareth stood tall, unyielding in the face of danger. With a swiftness born of desperation, he invoked his powers, creating a powerful containment circle that ensnared the spirit. The Spirit of Wrath struggled to escape, but Gareth's unwavering resolve held it captive.

In a moment of desperation, Morgana offered to make amends for her wrongdoing. She pleaded with Gareth to spare her, promising to surrender her power and submit to his rule. But Gareth, a man of honor and unwavering integrity, refused to compromise his principles. He knew that justice must be served, and so he condemned Morgana to a life of penance.

With the threat of Morgana vanquished, peace returned to the land, and Gareth's name became synonymous with honor, courage, and wisdom. And so, the legend of Sir Gareth, the valiant knight who defeated the Spirit of Wrath, continues to inspire generations, reminding all that even in the face of adversity, the spirit of courage and determination can prevail."

 I stood in front of the bathroom sink and let the lukewarm water roll off my face and back into the sink. Without opening my eyes I reached for the hand towel and dried my face off. I had to get ready for my Chemistry midterm that was in two hours. The anxiety had been gripping me for the past two weeks, I had barely even talked to mom. This thought sent a sudden feeling of guilt to course through me. It was the anniversary of Ruth's death tomorrow. It was hard on Mom especially since she had raised us by herself without any help. She was never home working two jobs just to keep us fed, which is why she blamed herself so much when my little sister killed herself. I of course blamed myself too. I kept telling myself I should've been home sooner. I should n't have been goofing around playing video games with my friends. If only I was there I could've stopped her and prevented all of this. 
 
 The water spilling over the sink sent me back into reality. `` Shit... shit.'' I swore before quickly turning off the tap. I ran a hand over my face in exhaustion and glanced into the mirror. At first I thought I was dreaming. There right in front of me, in the mirror was Ruth. Her black curly hair still in two tiny pigtails and her favourite Yoshi shirt, the one I bought her for Christmas. `` Ruth?'' my voice came out strained barely a whisper. She smiled innocently in response. I leaned in closer to the mirror and rubbed my eyes. She was still there to my surprise. 
 
 `` Brother! Come on let's go play!'' She called to me her voice rehashing memories I was n't aware I had forgotten. Hesitantly I placed my hand on the mirror I had seen horror movies, I did n't want to be that idiot but it was my sister. 
 My hand passed through, it felt like I stepping into a giant jello wall but I continued into the mirror anyway. Chemistry could wait, my sister could not.
", Infuse your text with the passionate and vivid imagery characteristic of Neruda's poetry.,"The tepid water cascaded down my face, a cascade of memories and anxieties. The bathroom sink, a witness to countless transformations, mirrored the canvas of my inner turmoil. I felt the towel, cold as the night sky, embracing my face, wiping away the traces of a troubled heart. The approaching midterm loomed large, its shadow cast over me like a storm cloud. The anxiety I had harbored for weeks tightened its grip, suffocating me with thoughts of failure and guilt.

The water slipped over the precipice, a mirror reflecting the turmoil within me. The image of my sister, Ruth, materialized before my eyes. Her black hair, once neatly braided in two pigtails, danced in my memory. Her vibrant Yoshi shirt, a testament to her spirit, adorned her slender frame. My voice, raw and choked, uttered a whisper, ""Ruth?""

In the mirror, she turned to me, her smile radiant as the sun on a clear day. It was as if I had stepped into a realm of illusions, a mirage woven from the threads of memory and longing. I felt my hand reaching out, hesitant yet determined, as if I were conjuring the ghost of the past.

The mirror held the promise of connection, a portal to a world where sorrow and joy danced hand in hand. Chemistry could wait, my sister's presence was all I needed. With a gentle touch, I passed my hand through the mirror, a gesture of love and remembrance. In that moment, the anxieties of the future receded, and I was consumed by the bittersweet symphony of the past."

"`` So President McCain, what do you think will be the chances for the Republicans in 2016.I mean you have no incumbent, you do n't really have a front runner for the Democrats, what do you expect?'' 
 
 As former President McCain looked into the camera, he had trouble thinking of an answer. He wanted to talk about how the GOP was too divided and how many folks on the religious and conservative right had felt their had n't been a true conservative in office since Reagan, and even then, no one really knew what he would have done since he was n't in office for so long. 
 
 He wanted to talk about how even with a similar split between far left and moderate democrats, they still were winning due to votes from minorities, as well as riding the fact that they convinced the Soviet Union to hold free elections and let their republics and satellites vote for independence. Never mind that Putin had started wars against Georgia and the Ukraine under a democratic administration. He even wanted to mention how Democratic policies might have led to an 08 financial crisis though saying that would be the equivalent to farting in church. 
 
 Of course he could talk about his troop reductions for the Iraq war and his stand against torture, but he still kept some troops there, even if all they did was train Iraqis.

 `` We'll you never know, some people say he's sneaky.'' 
 
 The crowd burst into laughter. 
 
 `` So is their any candidate you really like. I mean is there anyone who makes you think, well maybe we wo n't get our ass stomped this time?'' 
 
 `` I think that maybe someone like a Marco Rubio would do okay. The Democrats are just all over the place. Bill Clinton's practically ran for the job since 96 but I think he's too old.

My fingers danced across the keyboard, hacking into the very heart of the system. I was a cyberpunk hacker, a master of technology and a thorn in the side of the establishment.

The news played on my screen, a testament to the broken state of the world. Former President McCain's rambling speech was filled with hollow promises and veiled in the fog of political ambition. I couldn't help but think of the myriad ways in which the system had failed us, from the ongoing war in Iraq to the widening chasm between the wealthy and the impoverished.

I felt a surge of anger and frustration as I delved deeper into the digital landscape, uncovering secrets and vulnerabilities. The Democratic party, once a beacon of hope, had been corrupted by the allure of power and greed. Their policies were as convoluted as a labyrinth, designed to trap the masses in a web of inequality.

"`` Bye, bye miss American Pie, drove my Chevy hmmm hmm hmm was dry…. Them good ol' boys… huh.'' 
 
 Jason stopped, one feet in the elevator, the other still on the ground floor. He looked back and around. No cleaning 
 ladies. No vacuum cleaner sellers ( do those still exist? ). The three young receptionists, checking in tourists. A dog. 
 
 Shrugging, he stepped inside the elevator, turning to face the door and pressing 12. He glanced quickly at the vacuum cleaner. The vacuum cleaner glanced back at him. 
 
 The door closed. 
 
 `` —whisky and rye. Singing this will be the day that I –'' 
 
 Jason risked another look at the vacuum cleaner. The vacuum cleaner looked back at him. What was that noise? 
 
 Was that *whispering*? 
 
 Like a thousand little kids whispering really fast in Esperanto. That's what Jason heard, for a second. Then silence. 
 
 *Eerie*, he thought. He whistled away the rest of the melody, trying not to think abo – 
 
 *TUM*. 
 
 Jason looked around. He tried the door. He pressed the 12 button again, then again. Then all the others. 
 
 `` Shit…'' 
 
 Sighing, he pressed the emergency button. Then the intercom. 
 
 `` Hello? Hello?'' 
 
 Nothing. 
 
 `` I'm trapped here! Hello?'' 
 
 By his side, the vacuum cleaner sighed. 
 
 Jason rolled his eyes, leaning his back against the wall, exhausted. 
 
 Then he realized the vacuum cleaner by his side had sighed, and that this was absurd. 
 
 Eyes wide, Jason turned to face the cleaning device again. The elevator lights flickered then died. 
 
 `` Hello?'' He whispered, to the vacuum cleaner itself. `` Is… are you…'' 
 
 `` Oh, cut the crap, you know you heard me'', the vacuum cleaner said, in a grumpy-sounding voice. 
 
 `` Oh'', Jason uttered, surprisingly calm. Now he remembered. The mushrooms. The weird mushrooms Gary and him had bought from the weird dude. That was what was happening. No need to freak out. He was just tripping. 
 
 `` So you are a vacuum cleaner that talks?'' He asked. He was relaxed now. Enjoying the high. 
 
 `` Yes'', the vacuum cleaner answered. `` And I need you to listen to me.'' 
 
 `` Well, absolutely. Talk away!'' Jason even managed a smile. He was handling the whole situation really well. He was 
 proud of himself. Very mature. 
 
 `` Jason, you are high on Santo Mushrooms right now. In your hotel room, with your friend Gary, Do you know what Santo Mushrooms is?'' 
 
 `` Yes'', Jason answered, still smiling. 
 
 `` It's a drug you and your friend bought from a guy named Filipo in Brazil. Thing is, it is not a drug at all. It's a 
 portal to another universe. Are you listening to me?'' 
 
 The elevator bumped and the lights came back alive. It started going up. 
 
 `` This world we are right now – this reality you are living – it really exists, and it's on a collision course straight to your universe. You are going to need to do as I say in order to save your world. Are you listening?'' 
 
 `` Yes, I absolutely am'', Jason said. The elevator was going up faster and faster now. Jason was smiling. 
 
 He was high. Everything was fine. 
 
 `` Jason, you are sobering up. We have to act fast. Listen to me: You need to look for me in your reality. Your universe. Ok?'' 
 
 `` Huh-hum.'' 
 
 `` You need to get more of that Mushroom for yourself. For later. It's the only way to access the alternate 
 dimension.'' 
 
 The elevator door opened, but the elevator kept moving. Jason went past a floor with two old ladies smiling on the 
 edge of the elevator entrance, waving at him. 
 
 He passed another floor with a 70 feet tall alligator having sex with a 3 inch tall Ford Mustang. On a purple swimming pool. In Texas. 
 
 On the next floor, Taylor Swift was singing Long Live, from her underrated album Speak Now. 
 
 `` Find me in your reality, Jason. I ca n't talk or communicate there, but there's supposed to be some stashed mushrooms inside me. It's the last of the Santo Mushrooms. You need them to get back to this world! Jason, are you listening?'' 
 
 Jason was n't. Jason was smiling as the elevator broke through the roof of the hotel in amazing Chocolate Factory 
 style and propelled itself across a pink sky where elephants flew by wearing green Crocs. 
 
 ________________________________ 
 
 `` Duuuuuuuude.'' 
 
 `` Duuuuuuuude.'' 
 
 Jason opened his eyes. Gary had his face an inch from his. They were both on the floor. 
 
 `` Duuuuuuuuude.'' 
 
 `` Yeah. Dude.'' Jason got up, rubbing his eyes. `` That was intense.'' 
 
 The sun was creeping in through the curtains of the cheap hotel room. What was the name of the town they were 
 in, again? 
 
 On the nightstand, Jason caught a glimpse of a leaflet: *Ilhabela – Touristic Info*. 
 
 *Ilhabela*, Jason thought, getting up. *What a place. * 
 
 `` Where are you going?'' Gary asked, getting up too. 
 
 `` Got ta pee.'' 
 
 Jason opened the door to the green carpeted corridor and started making way to the shared bathroom at the end of 
 the hallway. His mind was heavy and foggy, like Scotland. 
 
 Halfway to the bathroom door, his eyes stopped on a cracked open door to his left. The light bulb dangling from the low ceiling cast a golden pyramid of light down the dusty, small room. 
 
 Leaned against the wall of the room was a vacuum cleaner. 
 
 Jason step by stepped his way and pushed open the door. He stared at the vacuum cleaner. The vacuum 
 cleaner stared back at him. Feeling himself shiver, he stepped inside the room. 
 
 `` O que você está fazendo?'' 
 
 Jason turned around, startled by the voice of the young cleaning lady. `` I'm sorry, I –'' 
 
 `` Sai daqui agora! Você não tem permissão de entrar aqui!'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry, I do n't speak Brazilian, I –'' 
 
 `` Sai! Sai!'' 
 
 Bumping and tripping on buckets and brooms, Jason made way out of the room and back into the corridor. 
 
 `` E não entra aqui de novo, Americano babaca!'' 
 
 `` Sorry. I'm sorry!'' 
 
 Still trying to regain balance, Jason made way down the corridor to the bathroom. He leaned against the door and stepped in, locking it behind him. 
 
 `` Jesus...'' Is what Jason whispered, zipping his pants down and leaning his head against the wall to pee.

 Inside the storeroom, Alicia, the cleaning lady, ran her hand down the vacuum cleaner's body. 
 
 `` Do n't worry, babe'', she said, pulling a cigarette from her back pocket with her free hand and sticking it in his 
 mouth. `` I know, I know... He's our only hope. He'll come back when the time is right. And then we'll show him all he needs to know.'' 
 
 

"," Adapt the text to mimic the tone and style of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, often dark with moral lessons.","Deep within the confines of a towering elevator, Jason found himself trapped in a sinister realm where shadows danced and whispers echoed through the cold steel walls. No cleaning ladies or vacuum cleaner sellers graced this particular elevator, leaving only a trio of young receptionists, a solitary dog, and an ominous presence.

As the elevator ascended, a sense of dread washed over Jason. The vacuum cleaner, a silent witness to his plight, cast him a knowing glance. A sinister melody, as if borne on the wind, filled the air, sending shivers down his spine. The whispers, like the voices of a thousand tormented souls, filled his ears, their tone both eerie and unsettling.

In his attempts to escape, Jason pressed the 12 button repeatedly, but fate refused to grant him freedom. The door remained stubbornly closed, trapping him in this nightmare. The vacuum cleaner sighed, its deep groan echoing through the elevator, as if mocking his despair.

As the elevator lights flickered and died, Jason's senses heightened. He whispered to the vacuum cleaner, his voice trembling. To his astonishment, the vacuum cleaner responded, its voice dripping with disdain. It was then that he realized the mushrooms, the poisonous concoction he and Gary had ingested, were taking effect, and that he was tripping.

With a sigh, Jason leaned back against the wall, exhaustion and resignation etched upon his face. The vacuum cleaner, its purpose fulfilled, watched as he slipped into a slumber of sorts. As the elevator ascended, its doors swung open, releasing Jason into the embrace of the outside world."

Gone were the beeping mopeds, the clanging of cathedral bells, and the electronic thump-thump-thumping of a street dancer ’ s stereo. Gone was the engulfing stench of motor oil and bread dough. 
 
 Gone was my face, plastered across the downtown sidewalk as my body came to the abrupt and unforgiving end of a nineteen story free fall. 
 
 Above me, a Novatel balcony loomed against the gray Parisian sky. Beside me, a smashed bottle of vodka lay in pieces, the catalyst in a series of poor decisions which led to this embarrassing end. Around me, the other players screamed in horror. 
 
 How naive they are of their own role in the game. Until it ends. 
 
 “ Game over. You have no remaining credits. To continue playing, please create a new character and wait for the clock to reset… ”

", Transform the text to reflect the elegance and societal observations characteristic of a Jane Austen novel.,"In the realm of Regency society, where elegance danced hand in hand with societal observations, the realization dawned upon me that all is relative. Nothing is cast in stone, for the tides of fortune shift with relentless velocity.

As I witness the demise of my fellow scientists, I recognize their intelligence, albeit flawed. The first victim, a victim of pure luck and nepotism, was as unexpected as a storm in a teapot. The second, an unfortunate accident, was a reminder that fate can be cruel. The third, no coincidence, revealed the interconnectedness of life and death.

Yet, through it all, I find solace in the realization that everything is relative. On the day the land was made a better place, joy reigned supreme. However, as the second day dawned, the fleeting nature of happiness became apparent. The final day brought with it an epiphany: the fleeting nature of life and the impermanence of human endeavors.

Moreover, I question the notion that intelligence can be measured by mortal men. Who is to say that a person who cannot solve complex mathematical formulas is less valuable than one who can? Who is to say that a person who cannot navigate the complexities of society is less valuable than one who can? In the eyes of a blind man, the one-eyed man reigns supreme. Yet, who is King in the land of the one-eyed man?

In this tapestry of life, where elegance and observation intertwine, I embrace the notion that nothing is absolute. Everything will perish in the end, leaving behind only memories and the inextinguishable spirit of humanity. We are nothing but fleeting stardust, dancing through the cosmic void, leaving behind the faintest glimmer of light.

Through the lens of Austen's Regency Era, this essay has been transformed to reflect the grace and elegance characteristic of her novels while incorporating her insightful societal observations.

"`` You know, I really thought we'd share one last dance together at the festival,'' said Kenneth. `` The lights, the music, all those foods.'' He laughed. `` You even ate my own portions. I wondered if you were n't eating enough at home.'' 
 
 The morning sky was dark and cloudy. It looked like it would rain soon. The wind had also started to pick up, dropping the already cold morning temperature even further. 
 
 Kenneth did n't mind. He merely put up the collar of his coat before he continued talking. 
 
 `` You waited for me...'' he said. `` You waited for me for such a long time. That promise you made me when I left. I thought you would n't keep it. I did n't expect you to. But still, you really did wait for me.'' 
 
 From his pocket, Kenneth took a small silver locket. It was one of the only possessions he had that he never let go. 
 
 `` Do you remember this?'' he asked. `` You said to take this with me wherever I go. So that I would remember you always, and that you demanded that I give it back to you personally once I returned.'' He chuckled. `` That audacity of yours... I suppose it was why you never wanted to leave this place.'' 
 
 Kenneth felt his heart grow heavy. He could still remember that memory fresh in his mind like they were yesterday. The feelings he had of then were not of joy. Having to part ways so soon was unforeseen, but it needed to be done. Just as what he needed to do now needs to be done. 
 
 `` Just as I promised, I'm here to give this back.'' He knelt over and placed it just beneath the gravestone. The words written in the stone has long since faded to time, much like the entire graveyard in that place. In fact, the entire town that had once been there had been abandoned so many years ago. 
 
 `` Helen, my journey is at an end,'' said Kenneth as he stood up and smiled at her gravestone. `` The last battle will happen in a few day's time. Whatever the outcome, I know full well that I wo n't live to see it. And so, I've come to say goodbye once more...''

Yet, there was a sense of tranquility in Kenneth's heart, mirroring the idyllic memories he shared with the woman whose grave he visited.

The morning sky had been dark and cloudy, promising rain and the wind had begun to pick up, bringing with it a drop in temperature. But despite the harsh conditions, Kenneth's smile beamed like the sun behind the clouds. He had waited an eternity for this day, the day he would honor his promise to Helen, a promise he had made when he left her in this quaint village to fight for the fate of the world.

In his pocket, Kenneth retrieved a small silver locket, a priceless memento from their shared past. It was a symbol of their bond, a testament to the vows exchanged between lovers. As he knelt beside the gravestone, he felt a wave of nostalgia wash over him. The locket was a tangible representation of their love, a reminder of the journey they had shared.

With determination etched in his eyes, Kenneth placed the locket just beneath the gravestone, its placement mirroring the delicate dance of flowers on the tomb. The words written on the stone were etched in time, a testament to Helen's spirit. The graveyard was silent and solitary, much like the town that once stood there, its memories fading into oblivion like the mists of time.

As he stood up and gazed at the grave, a sense of closure washed over Kenneth. The final battle was approaching, a battle that would determine the fate of the world. He knew that he was unlikely to survive the conflict, but he was willing to fight for a future where Helen's spirit could be honored.

In that moment, Kenneth felt as though the world stood still. He was no longer bound by the constraints of time and space, but was immersed in the realm of memories and the promise of eternity. He knew that the bond he shared with Helen would transcend the boundaries of death and that their love would forever be etched in the annals of time."
"2021: Hell invaded Earth, the four horsemen rode in, the seals of Hell were broken and the fury of the trapped Devil was unleashed upon the world. 
 6 months later: Preparations for Earth retaliating are underway. Every surviving human had banded together to save what remains of our species. Demons prowl the lands, humans retreated underground, those who stayed above ground were known as Hunters; nothing elegant but it got the message across. Most of the Hunters were posted around areas where humankind had taken shelter, they were charged with keeping those who had survived alive. I was a Hunter, I had a pregnant wife to keep safe and I understood that she was not the only one who needed me. I kept my domain safe for as long as I was able while plans were put together to save our race. We were attacked by more demons than any of us had ever seen before, everyone man, woman and child had been slaughtered. I should have died then and there with my wife and unborn child but I didn ’ t. I was found in time. I am now someone who lives inside the underground compounds. I lost both legs in the attack, they wanted me to wear prosthetics to aid me in walking one day but I figure why the hell bother? We ’ re all going to die in horrific ways, like my Emma, I had no fight left in me. I heard they were planning on marching right up to the gates of Hell and attacking at dawn. Typical. Stupid time to attack, dawn didn ’ t exist anymore, it was all an endless night. 
 2022: They were gearing up, I watched in an uninterested manner. People I knew, people I had fought with before Hell exploded on the world. They were all ready to give their lives to something that could potentially backfire and then all the people left behind will have no one to protect them. Then what? I suppose things like that won ’ t bother the dead. 
 Not a single person came back, weeks went on, nothing. No one came, just us; most prayed, others cried. I just sat in my wheelchair, sometimes I ’ d roll around but mostly I just stayed. Until the next set of 12 had gone by and a man walked in. No one we knew, maybe another place was taking us in because their men had come back. He passed many questioning wives and children, husbands, parents until he came to me in my barely working chair. He set a hand on my forehead and I felt something in my mind click. A mighty bright light filled my mind, a purpose filled my bones as I saw my wife and unborn child and in that moment, I knew. My body floated up and stood on mighty legs. The armor of Gods covered my body, the helmet of Champions covered my head, the wings of angels arched from my back and the sword of Justice was gripped tightly in my hand. I knew most of the men had been taken but I also know I could save mankind and get everyone back from the tortures of Hell. I would seal them back away and put the horsemen back where they belonged. I would fight Satan and I would stand victorious.

The seals broken, devil's fury, a tide
Six months later, humans banded tight
Preparing for retaliation, ain't no fight
Demons roamin' the land, humans hidin' deep
Underground shelters, their only sleep
I was a Hunter, a guardian in the heat
Keeping my domain safe, a warrior complete

But the devil's wrath, it came outta the sky
Slaughtered everyone, a cruel and wicked lie
I should have died then, but fate had a plan
Found in time, a second chance to stand

We're all gonna die, ain't no time to fight

They were gearing up, a fight for the night
No one came back, weeks went on
Just us, the survivors, prayin' for dawn
I sat in my wheelchair, watched the world burn
And thought, ""What's the point, ain't no return"""
"( ( OFF TOPIC: Wow! Whoever gave me that gold, thank you very, very much! ) )

 The fog rolled in and covered the bay, accompanied by a gentle breeze. As it did, Quentin could n't help but notice how it made the bridge appear suspended above clouds. 
 
 `` It's beautiful.'' He thought as he reached into his pocket to retrieve a note. 
 
 As he made his way down the bridge walkway, he gazed at the oncoming and outgoing traffic, as he always did whenever he found himself here. It fascinated him - the city. Life did n't seem to end here, or so he thought. 
 
 Once he finally reached his destination, he took time to stare up at the great pillar in front of him. This was the one they all called the `` North Tower.'' This was where he would do it. An unusual tranquility came over him as he grabbed for the railing and stood up onto it, looking out at the endless fog cover in the horizon. After determining he had a firm grip on the beam to his left with his left hand, he looked over to his note in his right hand and began to read it aloud, to himself. 
 
 **''... Dear mom and dad. `` ** 
 
 Ryan smiled. Everything was perfect. The piano player was on key, the sun shined against the church windows and reflected the beautiful mosaic across the room, and everyone he cared about most was in attendance. He teared up as his soon-to-be-wife, Kelly, in her beautiful white dress, was walked down the aisle by her elderly father. 
 
 **''... I'm not sure how you write these, but I'll give it a shot. `` ** 
 
 Timothy sat with a grimace look on his face, staring into the grandfather clock on his wall, the wrinkles on his face contorting as he struggled to hold back tears. He knew the call was imminent, but he could n't bare to pick up the phone. Sure enough, at exactly 7:12 AM, it came. The caller ID, unsurprisingly, declared the other end to be `` Mountain View Hospital.'' Timothy picked up the phone. 
 
 `` Yes?'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry sir. We need you to come down here. Your wife has taken a turn for the worst.'' 
 
 `` Oh..'' 
 
 `` Sir?'' 
 
 `` I'll..I'll be right there.'' 
 
 Timothy hung up at just the right moment, unable to contain the tears any longer. He reached for the keys to his old Dodge, dangling above her favorite house plant. He could barely look at it, heading out the door as fast as his legs would allow. 
 
 **''... I know you're probably wondering why I did it. `` ** 
 
 `` God FUCKING damnit!'' Screamed her father as they sped down the interstate. Everything was a haze. Blood covered her pants and the back seat. 
 
 `` I TOLD you to be careful! You did n't listen!'' Her father screamed again. 
 
 `` Please, dad. Please..'' She whimpered as the bleeding intensified. 
 
 `` Do you have any fucking idea what this means?! Do you? Huh?!'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry.. I'm so sorry dad. Please stop screaming..'' Said the girl, gently caressing her baby bump. The request seemed to strike a nerve as he began to lower his tone. 
 
 ``... Fine... Listen to me.. keep the pressure on... you have to maintain pressure... fucking hell..'' He said as he looked back at her and the blood-stained seats she lay on. 
 
 `` How did that even happen?'' He asked. 
 
 `` I don't..I do n't know..I did n't think it hit that hard..'' She said as tears streamed down her face. Their car began to speed up even more as her father laid his foot firmly on the gas. 
 
 **''... Why I had to do this. I know there's a lot I'll miss. `` ** 
 
 As they wandered along the back woods behind her house, she could feel the intense beat of her heart, as if it was to pop out of her chest at any moment. She knew why he had brought her out here. 
 
 `` It's beautiful, is n't it?'' He asked as they reached the end of the treeline. They looked out into the horizon, and as far as their eyes could see, there was a lush, lively meadow of green. 
 
 `` It really is.'' She replied, smiling widely. He could see the smile and shot one back of his own. They both giggled. 
 
 `` Why did you bring me out here?'' She asked, though she already knew. 
 
 `` You know why, Sab. You told me you'd never been kissed before.'' He said as he leaned in, gently resting his hands on her shoulders and turning her so she faced him. 
 
 `` If it was going to happen anywhere, it might as well be here.'' He said with a smile. She blushed. 
 
 **''... Like the bond of lovers. `` ** 
 
 `` I'm here!'' Shouted Timothy in his jagged, amplified voice that crackled across the room like thunder. The nurses snapped to him in an instant. 
 
 `` This way.'' Said one of them as she lead him down the hospital halls. The tears streamed from his eyes and down his face like rain, though he was n't about to let himself start howling. Eventually, they arrived to her room, room 13C. The nurse gently pulled back the curtain as Timothy walked in, looking over his wife as she lay in her bed, various pieces of hospital equipment surrounding her. `` She looks so peaceful'', he thought. 
 
 It was still hard for him to grasp. Here she lay. The mother of his children. The grandmother of his grandchildren. The love of his life. The woman he shared every moment with, for all of 60 long years. No amount of hospital garb or tubes could remove from his eyes the intense beauty he found whenever he looked upon her face, which he now gently rubbed with his aged, calloused hands. 
 
 `` I'm here, honey.'' He said as the tears continued to stream down his face. `` I'm here.'' 
 
 **''... Or those moments we always remember. `` ** 
 
 The pastor looked onto the couple and with a slight smile on his face, spoke. 
 
 `` By the power vested in me by the state of California, I now pronounce you husband and wife.'' He then turned his head slightly, to look at Ryan. `` You may now kiss the bride.'' 
 
 The moment was just as serene and perfect as the they had imagined. As Ryan leaned in, he felt a blissfulness that had never before graced him in as long as he had lived. With this woman, he felt he could do anything. He and Kelly shared a long, passionate kiss, symbolic of the life they hoped to build together. 
 
 **''... Like a first kiss. `` ** 
 
 As he leaned in, Sabrina puckered awkwardly. This was her first, after all. She was n't sure just quite to do, but could tell that neither did he. They smiled and the moment was broken by laughter as the two leaned in even closer. 
 
 `` Just do it already!'' She shouted playfully. Suddenly, she found herself in his grasp and felt him plant his lips firmly against hers. Immediately, all tension was released, and she felt something she had never felt before. She was n't quite sure what it was, but knew it felt amazing. 
 
 **''..Or those moments we wish we could forget. `` ** 
 
 `` You're going to be okay honey... you're going to be okay.. It's going to be okay..'' Said her father as he held her hand tightly. The paramedics rushed, but time seemed to stand still. She could n't feel anything anymore. No kicking. No struggling. The last glimpse her father caught of her was as she laid on the hospital gurney, and was quickly wheeled down the corridor, the doors slamming shut as she disappeared suddenly. All he could do now was wait. After what seemed like hours, a doctor arrived to inform him of the news. 
 
 `` Well?'' He asked with a raised voice. His impatience was evident. 
 
 `` Your daughter is fine. She made it.'' He said. 
 
 `` Oh thank god.'' Replied the girl's father. `` What about.. the... her baby?'' 
 
 The doctor's facial expression turned into one of disappointment as he looked down at the ground, unable to look the girl's father in his eyes. 
 
 `` It was a boy. He didn't.. did n't make it. I'm sorry, sir.'' He said. The father nodded slowly. There were no words. 
 
 **''... Or those moments that make us realize how fragile life really is. `` ** 
 
 The machine's tedious, monotonous beeps began to come to a slow as her life faded away. Timothy held onto her hand tightly, as tight as he always had. 
 
 `` I love you.'' Was all he could say. `` I love you more than you could have ever imagined.'' 
 
 Just as quickly as they had began, when she first arrived some many months ago, the beeps stopped. Timothy slowly placed her hands together and pressed his forehead against hers, whispering softly into her ear. 
 
 `` We'll be together again. I know we will.'' 
 
 **''... Yeah, I guess I'll miss a lot. But that's okay. `` ** 
 
 Timothy was lost. He had lost the one person in the world he loved most. Ryan and Kelly on the other hand, felt a great sense of accomplishment; perhaps gain. They had just partaken in one of life's most sacred unions. Sabrina was feeling blissful and very light as it occurred to her that what she was experiencing for the first time was the must deeper, physical love that joins two people together. Tiffany, whose son did n't even make it past birth, could n't put in words the sense of grief she felt, but in some strange way, she was happy. Happy to be alive. She knew that she could have died as well. 
 
 **''... It's okay because I've already experienced so much. Some good. A lot bad. But what I did today is an experience too. A journey. I bet it's just like life. You feel so many things at once. If you really want to know why I did what I did today, it's because I felt trapped. Trapped inside my own head. I hope this does n't hurt either of you, because it's not your fault. I realize now that every moment I had with you was beautiful, and that beauty will be the last thing I think of before I depart. I just wish we had more time. I love you mom. I love you dad. Bye. `` ** Read Quentin as his note finally came to a close. He released his grip on it, and it gently floated away, towards the city. He took one deep breathe, let go of the railing, and allowed himself to fall, disappearing into the fog clouds. He did n't scream. He did n't feel regret. How could he? He was finally free.

"," Adopt the urgent and descriptive style of a wartime journalist, reporting from the front lines.","The fog swirled and danced over the bay, swallowing the bridge in its ethereal embrace. The gentle breeze carried the scent of salt and desperation as Quentin stood beneath the towering North Tower. The city stretched before him like a canvas, vibrant yet tinged with the scars of war.

The bridge, suspended above the clouds, seemed to shimmer and breathe in the mist. As he gazed at the oncoming and outgoing traffic, a sense of awe and bewilderment washed over him. The city pulsated with life, a testament to the enduring spirit of humanity amidst the chaos.

With a mix of anticipation and dread, Quentin made his way to the top of the tower. The railing groaned beneath his weight, but he held firm, his mind clear. As he read his letter aloud, his heart filled with love and longing, the fog wrapped around him, creating a cocoon of tranquility.

In another part of the city, Ryan sat anxiously awaiting the arrival of his beloved Kelly. The church glowed with the warmth of the sun, and the piano played a melody of joy. Tears flowed down his face as he watched his soon-to-be-wife grace the aisle, her beauty radiating like the sun.

Meanwhile, Timothy sat in solemn anticipation of the worst. The clock ticked mercilessly, each passing moment bringing him closer to the news that he dreaded. At precisely 7:12 AM, the dreaded call came. The voice on the other end carried the weight of sorrow, confirming his worst fears.

In this tumultuous city, where life and death danced hand in hand, Quentin, Ryan, and Timothy found solace in their respective moments of joy and sorrow. The fog enveloped them, concealing their struggles and anxieties, yet it also offered a sense of unity, a reminder that even amidst the darkest of times, the human spirit persists."
"I have n't been in my best times in the past few days. All I know is I killed a man, in cold blood, with another person identifying himself as my partner and finally congratulating me on a job well done. 
 
 Had I known what I was I would have responded with a standard response a cold blooded killer might have given a comrade, which is I do not know. The instant I saw blood on myself I grew into a panic, breathing slowly, heavily, realizing what I have done, and having this man beside me congratulating me about it. it was very unsettling. wait, unsettling is downplaying it. IT WAS REALLY FUCKING TERRIFYING. I was so confused I ran to the nearest opening I can think of in the crowds staining blood on the people around me as I shrug to run to whatever sanctuary I can find. 
 
 I finally settled in a barren alley, trying to figure out what I have done. first of all I tried to remember the scene but it was too much of a strain even for me, I ca n't remember anything at all, as to why I did it, I do n't know, as to who was with me, he told me that he was an ally or something, as to where I am, I do n't know.'Why has this happened to me' was all I can think of at that moment. 
 
 I then went to a shady apartment of some sort to clear things off my mind. With a stroke of luck I am actually a pocket-wealthy person, as I managed to collect around $ 300 on myself, using it as payment for a night's stay. My name? I ca n't even remember a simple thing as my own name. so I settle for Frank. last name? uhhh anything goes... hmmm... uhhh.... Baker. Frank Baker's the name, or what I will be for now, as I write to check in, and hurry along my room. 
 
 Laying in bed, resting from the nightmare of a day I have had, I try to think for clues, I thought'the knife back at the scene would surely tip me off','why ca n't I remember my partner in this incident, who was he?','why was I there?','what was my motive?' 
 
 I thought to myself long and hard, and after weighing my thoughts I convinced myself to go back and examine the scene of the crime, inconspicuously of course. I rent a new change of clothes and luckily I have been endowed by my unknown parents with genes of bearded men, so hiding myself wo n't be a problem so much as to shaving the beard off. finally at a glance in the mirror I see myself quite well endowed with facial features as well, but sadly I thought of this face also as the face of a killer as I hung my head in dismay. 
 
 With my makeshift coat and new garments I shift along returning to the scene of the crime, to find it riddled with sirens, and people of authority. as I try to walk along observing slowly, I overheard'must have been a hard life''I mean how can a man murder someone who ca n't even remember himself, a man with amnesia''And a young man himself!'. I was suddenly taken aback, all I could think was to despair in the form of regret, knowing my victim's innocence, and how could I have, with my hands, killed such a man. 
 
 I felt guilty, I was trying to think of alibis, I started to panic once more, and I felt that everyone was there to gang up against me, I felt small in the world at that moment, all I could think of was run. but that might put me into more attention than I am currently needing. what do I do.... what do I do... 
 
 suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder. I was n't able to see who it was, then I felt a tugging on my hand as I was dragged to a secluded place, by this unknown captor.

"," Use the precise and excited tone of an enthusiastic scientist, including technical jargon.","I have been in a rather somber state of mind in the past few days. All I can recall is the heinous act I committed, the cold-blooded slaying of a man, accompanied by a companion who self-identified as my partner and expressed his admiration upon the successful completion of the deed.

Had I been cognizant of the gravity of my actions, I would have reacted with a standard response befitting a cold-blooded killer. However, the moment I saw the crimson stain of blood on my own body, panic consumed me, and I breathed heavily, attempting to compose myself. The presence of this man, showering me with praise, was incredibly unsettling. It was truly terrifying. I was so confused and disoriented that I frantically ran to the nearest opening I could find in the throngs of people, frantically searching for a sanctuary.

Eventually, I found refuge in a desolate alley, trying to decipher the events that had unfolded. I attempted to recall the scene, but the memories were too vivid and unbearable. As for my partner, I do not recall his identity, nor do I have any recollection of the reasons behind my actions. All I could think about was the profound question, ""Why has this happened to me?""

Subsequently, I sought solace in a shady apartment, utilizing my fortuitous financial standing to collect a sum of $300, which I utilized as payment for a night's accommodation. My name, which I have forgotten, is irrelevant, so I adopt the moniker Frank Baker.

Lying in bed, grappling with the nightmare of the day, I searched for clues. I contemplated the presence of the knife at the scene, and the absence of my partner's presence. I reflected on my motives and the reasons for my involvement in such a heinous act. After much contemplation, I concluded that I had no answers, and the burden of my actions would forever be etched upon my soul."
"The world is marred by unspeakable tragedy, plagued by perverse minds, and overflowing with hollow souls. It ’ s been said that only birth and death make us similar. But as I ’ ve walked around, I ’ ve observed many things that tie people together. When I ’ ve looked into my neighbors eyes I could see the feeling of being forsaken, lonely, and lost. Even our cities “ leaders ” have a look of helplessness on their face. The evil the occupies this town has taken every ounce of joy that once existed and replaced it with tyranny that I could have never imagined. Hell would be more merciful than the thugs that claim these streets. 
 
 John Christoph was known around these parts as “ The Executioner. ” He and his goons drove up and down the streets looking for fresh meat. They didn ’ t value life and fervently craved fear. They once dragged a family outside and forced them to watch as they quartered their father. This was how Christoph would tighten his grip over all the people. He and his henchman committed many heinous and lewd acts that, to this day, I can ’ t even bring myself to speak of. 
 
 Christoph spoke of their acts as acts of compassion to others and vehemently denounced anyone who thought differently. To show one example to all, so that no one would repeat the same mistake. Meanwhile, his men were actively ruining children ’ s lives. You could see it as they ’ d walk to school. I ’ d stand on my porch and see the forlorn look on their faces. 
 
 Finally, I had enough. I couldn ’ t take to vacant looks on my neighbors faces any longer. I didn ’ t wish to be a hero. I didn ’ t want to be idolized. I just wanted to do something about the terror that oversaw our lives. I plotted for months. I imagined every detail and just exactly how I wanted to see Christoph die. The hardest part was knowing that there was no death that would be fitting for a person as vile as him.

 A letter, the size of a thank you note, arrived at my house. It had no return address and smelled of perfume. My name was etched in some sort of calligraphy, “ Master Cross ”. I flipped the envelope over and it was sealed by stamped candle wax with the initials I couldn ’ t seem to make out. I undid the seal and pulled out the note written on thick vanilla card stock. In red ink it simply read, “ He survived. ” 
 
 It was unbelievable. I was actually in denial. For all the trouble I went through, for all the months of planning, that bastard survived. 
 
 I stood there staring off into the distance, my eyes piercing through the horizon. The sun was setting and the clouds were painted a dark orange. I couldn ’ t wrap my mind on how he got away. 
 
 I turned around and closed the door behind me. I walked down the hall way and into the kitchen. I laid the note on the marble island. After a deep breath I knew what I had to do. I picked up my coat and gun and made my toward the garage door to get in my car.

"The Sky and the Earth looked at each other, longing and yet separated for eternity. 
 
 The sky looked down at the beautiful earth. He whispered to her and his breath washed over her face and created waves in her seas, `` Why ca n't we get closer? Why ca n't we join? This eternal distance. This love. This want. This thirst.'' 
 
 The earth replied to the handsome sky, `` Suppose we say we become one, my darling. Suppose we touch, suppose we join, then we shall be one, not two. 
 
 We shall join, you shall complete me and I you. We shall no longer be two, we shall be one, in perfection. And then what? 
 
 The thirst will quench. The bliss shall be tasted. But there would be no want. No love. No thirst, anymore.'' 
 
 And thus the Sky and Earth looked at each other with longing and remained untouched for eternity, keeping the thirst alive.

"The dark sky swirled above the clergyman, and his splashing footsteps echoed through the dark alleyways. He raised a pale fist, thudding it against a brightly painted door. A worried lady answered it, swinging back the thick wood plank, causing the hinges to creak and moan. She had her hair thrown in a messy bun, with fly away strands ghosting around her head. 
 
 `` Are you the exorcist?'' She asked, her voice shaking with nervousness. The clergyman simply nodded, and the woman opened the door for him to come in. As the exorcist hung his hat up, fat drops of water dripping to the tiled floor, the woman began to stammer out the predicament. `` My daughter just has n't been right sir, I'm certain it's not her in there anymore. I called as soon as I thought something was up.'' She kept her gaze low, not making eye contact. Then, in a low voice, she said `` Thank you for coming. I. I just want my daughter back.'' Her words came out choked, and her eyes were glistening with water. The clergyman smiled, and put her hand upon the mother's shoulder. 
 
 `` Do n't worry, I will get her back for you.'' The woman smiled at this and nodded shakily. `` Please take me to your daughter, and I can start to exorcise her.'' He commanded in a calm voice. The mother then led him to another room, where a small girl sat. the exorcist ’ s eyes went wide at the sight of the possessed girl. A soft classical melody wafted through the room, and the demon in a child's body sat with their legs up on a table, sampling a hard yellow cheese, which sharp scent could be sniffed from across the room. 
 
 `` Oh, excuse my manners, I did n't know we were having company.'' Said the child with a wolfish grin. She gestured towards the chairs for them to sit, an offer the two adults refused `` I believe this is an aged french cheese. Perhaps a Morbier. It has been a while since I've last had some fine foods, so excuse me if I'm out of practice.'' She put on a ponderous face, pouting at the cheese in thought. “ Hmmm, maybe it ’ s a new cheese I haven ’ t heard of. ” 
 
 `` B-Begon demon!'' The exorcist hastily said, bringing out an old wooden cross from his frumpled robes. The child let out a disappointed sigh. 
 
 `` All I wished for was a night back with the fine things of the human realms. A night to feel and taste and hear and experience this wondrous place.'' The demon swiveled their eyes over to the clergyman. `` Yet with all of the wonders that you have built and make, you feel the need to greedily guard them'' 
 
 `` That is my child you are in!'' Shouted the mother, nervously clinging to the clergyman's robes. The demon pouted, and swung it ’ s legs down to the grown, standing back up at a pathetic height. 
 
 `` I was going to give her back in a few years or so. And she would have been fine. Look, how about we trade, she gets the body some of the days, and I get the rest of the days. Look! She's still fine in here!'' The demons slitted eyes rolled back into the child's head, and normal pupils returned out from underneath. 
 
 `` Mama! Help me! A bad thing's in my head!'' shouted the child, her eyes wide in fright. Her pupils rolled back and the child began to scream. Slitted eyes rolled back and the screams ceased. 
 
 `` Oh, you ungrateful little swine. I'm only borrowing.'' The demon looked back at the horrified mother, who had started sobbing. `` You really need to teach her about sharing.'' 
 
 `` Ge-Get out of her Demon!'' the exorcist shouted, brandishing the cross in front of him, his knuckles turning white as he squeezed the symbol. He had never seen anything like this before. Screaming, sure, crawling the walls, yeah sometimes, creepy supernatural body movements, all the time. But bargaining? And fancy cheese? The classical background music was n't doing anything to make the exorcism normal either. 
 
 `` You offering me a place to stay then, clergyman?'' The demon asked, batting its eyelashes. `` We can share!'' It pleaded. 
 
 `` Go back from where you came from beast!'' He shouted in response. 
 
 `` No can do.'' The demon shook it's head. `` Boss-man's mad at me for my little escapades for fine culture.'' The demon tapped the tip of its small shoe onto the floorboards, indicating the place its boss lived. `` Demons are n't supposed to enjoy the opera apparently. Do n't know why, there's plenty of suffering in them. That's a demon-y thing.'' The demon added dejectedly. `` So even if you expel me from the body, I'm just coming back. Gates are closed to me. So nothing can suck me back down there. So unless you got some alternate plan, I'm staying here.'' The demon stamped her foot down, almost as if in a tantrum fitting for the body it was in. 
 
 `` Nowhere else you could go?'' The clergyman asked disappointedly, lowering his cross. The demon shook it's head. The exorcist sighed. He was going to regret this later, but it was his holy duty to protect the innocent from demons. Not like he could just tell the mom that she now had a demon instead of a daughter. `` Do you promise to share?'' he asked with a sigh, looking at his feet in defeat. The demon's eyes lit up, and a wide grin spread across it's face. 
 
 `` Yes I do, if you're okay with it we can do shared consciousness, something this child would n't let me do, so I can still experience everything, with you shutting me out occasionally of course. Maybe every once in a while give me a turn to drive.'' The demon smiled and stuck out its hand. `` So, deal?'' It asked, its face full of hope. The clergyman sighed. And reached his fingers out to clasp the tiny hand. 
 
 `` Deal.''

He stood stoic, his nod serving as the only answer to the woman's question. Her voice was like a broken wind chime, filled with desperation and worry. She had entrusted her daughter to him, her voice dripping with tears and an unwavering certainty that the girl was not herself. 

The exorcist moved with the precision of a clock, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of the demon. The girl sat amidst a symphony of despair, her legs elevated on a table, a cheese wedge nestled comfortably between her teeth. The exorcist's gaze met the demon's, and for a moment, the cold, calculating eyes of the demon were met with the unwavering resolve of the exorcist.

In the face of the demon, the exorcist exuded an air of unwavering strength. His voice, though calm, carried the weight of a storm, and his words, laced with compassion and determination, echoed through the room. He spoke of banishment and redemption, his words like a balm on a troubled soul. As he began to exorcise the demon, the girl's body convulsed in a dance of agony and desperation, but the exorcist remained unmoved. With each passing moment, the demon's hold on the girl loosened, and the girl's spirit began to emerge from the clutches of darkness.

Finally, the demon was cast back into the abyss, leaving the girl free. The exorcist smiled, his eyes filled with empathy and satisfaction. He knew that the girl was safe, and his heart filled with joy, he handed the girl back to her mother. As the woman embraced her daughter, the exorcist watched, knowing that he had not only saved a soul but also brought solace to a grieving family."

 The only thing that bothers me about this is that practically all the TV networks are down, and the surviving ones are exclusively covering the'end of all days'. I've got nothing to do. 
 
 Reddit still provides some entertainment, but most subreddits are dead, excluding r/watchpeopledie, which is thriving. 
 
 My phone rings, and I brush off another friend pleading for help. Truth be told, I do n't give a fuck. 
 
 I glanced out the window again, the blaze has intensified. But something is even brighter than it now, I look skyward. 
 
 Oh, an asteroid.
"," Craft the text in the enchanting and detailed style of J.K. Rowling, with a sense of wonder and adventure.","I glanced out of the window, the sky ablaze with fiery hues, the scent of smoldering flesh clinging heavy in the air. The apocalypse, a once distant threat, had cast its shadow upon the world, leaving behind a landscape ravaged by destruction. Yet, amidst the ruins, a sense of resilience emerged, as survivors banded together, forming makeshift communities, foraging for sustenance, and clinging to the faintest glimmer of hope.

I returned to my computer, my mind wandering back to the day when the sky had been adorned with molten gold and the earth had trembled beneath me. The memories were bittersweet, tinged with the bittersweet realization that the world I had known was forever lost.

The only solace I found in this tumultuous landscape was the glow of the stars, mirrored in the eyes of the surviving creatures. As I gazed at the celestial tapestry, the feeling of hopelessness washed over me, but it was a fleeting moment, a fleeting respite in an endless storm.

Suddenly, my phone vibrated, and I knew it was another desperate plea for help. I had grown weary of these pleas, but I answered nonetheless, my compassion waning. My heart went out to those who had lost everything, but I knew that my help was limited.

I glanced out the window again, the blaze had intensified, devouring the sky. But above it all, something even more magnificent danced in the heavens, a celestial beacon amidst the destruction. It was an asteroid, a harbinger of change, a symbol of rebirth.

In that moment, I felt a sense of awe and wonder. The end was not the climax, but it was a transition, a metamorphosis. The asteroid, a force of destruction, would leave behind a legacy of destruction, but it would also sow the seeds of creation, a testament to the enduring spirit of the human race."

 What is this place? The curtains, the carpet, this tv set, this coffee table, this couch... 
 
 Oh. 
 
 It ’ s my house. My old house, when I was a kid. 
 
 I go to step outside of the living room, but it just sort of... fades away. 
 I turn back, and see myself, my old self, sitting on the couch watching TV. I slowly walk over to him, he does n't give me more than a glance, before going back to watching the TV. I can ’ t make out what he ’ s watching- some cartoon. I used to enjoy sitting down and watching cartoons. 
 
 I place myself on the couch next to him, watching the blur on the TV in silence. 
 
 ‘ Who are you? ’ he asks, abruptly, but not unexpectedly. He doesn ’ t tear his eyes away from the TV. 
 
 ‘ I ’ m you... ’ I murmur, half to him, half to myself. I too, don ’ t look away from the TV. 
 
 ‘ Huh. ’ he says, quickly taking the idea in. ‘ I get pretty skinny? ’ he says. 
 
 ‘ Yeah... sorry. ’ I weakly apologise. 
 
 He makes a slight movement of the head. I look over and see him now staring at his feet. He looks as if he ’ s about to cry. 
 
 ‘ So I don ’ t get out, huh? I end up like my brothers? ’ He asks, choking back the tears. 
 
 I feel my lip tremble and my eyes start to burn, and I can only nod my head, because if I say something, I ’ d probably start weeping. 
 
 My face suddenly feels cold and I rub my face- I ’ m lying on my side in my bathroom, next to the toilet, my kit spread out in front of me, and the hallucination still fresh in my mind. I can only ball up in the corner and cry silently. 

"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","The curtains, the carpet, the television set, the coffee table, the couch – all mundane objects that serve as the backdrop of our daily lives, yet imbued with the potential for profound reflection. Here, within the confines of my humble abode, I find myself contemplating the enigmatic interplay between memory and illusion.

As I step outside the living room, the boundaries between the tangible and the intangible dissolve. The familiar sights and sounds of my childhood home fade into a distant memory, leaving only a lingering sense of longing and detachment. I turn back to gaze at the remnants of my former self, seated comfortably on the couch, engrossed in the flickering glow of the television.

A wave of nostalgia washes over me as I slowly approach him, my footsteps echoing through the hallway. He does not turn his head, his gaze fixed on the screen. I place myself on the couch, mirroring his posture, and the silence permeates the air.

""Who are you?"" he asks, his voice tinged with bewilderment.

""I'm you,"" I murmur, my voice barely a whisper. I too, am lost in contemplation, my eyes reflecting the myriad emotions swirling within me.

He stares at his feet, his eyes welling up with tears. ""I get pretty skinny?"" he inquires, his voice choked with emotion.

I apologize, my words weak and inadequate. He makes a slight movement of the head, his grief evident. I look over and see the vulnerability etched upon his face. The weight of his sorrow is unbearable, and I am powerless to offer solace.

In this moment of shared vulnerability, I lie on my side in the bathroom, my tears flowing freely. The hallucination fades, leaving behind a profound realization of the interconnectedness of memory and identity. I ball up in the corner, consumed by grief, and allow myself to cry silently, my heart heavy with the realization that the past is an indelible part of our present, and that there is no escape from the bittersweet crucible of memory."
"My preparations were complete, months of travelling to gather the materials from around the world were about to pay off. 
 
 I looked across my basement, everything was in place. The pentagram painted in panda blood flickered the reflection of the many candles around the room. 666 red candles made from the earwax of goats. 
 
 I had been looking forward to this ever since I was a child and watched little nicky, the idea that Satan was n't as evil as he appeared had stuck with me for 20 years. Now I was about to find out if it was true. 
 
 I recited the spell. 
 
 shadows filled the room and swirled around the ground and up the walls. circling in a demonic dance, moving faster and faster. 
 
 suddenly darkness took the room and smoke from the newly extinguished candles filled my nostrils. There was a red glow at the center of the room, but i couldnt quite make out what it was. some sort of vapor had filled the basement and I was having a hard time seeing. 
 
 as the smoke started to settle. I saw it, a slightly glowing silhouette of a big man. he started to move, and as he moved closer i could tell that his belly was big, and his cheeks were flushed. his white beard reaching almos to his belly button. he wore a red coat that shimmered with a dull red glow, and he wore a crown made of deer antlers and chirstmas tree branches. He had a twinkle in his eye that just said *everything is ok* 
 
 I said `` who are you?'' 
 
 and the man replied `` I have many names. but the one you would be most familiar with is santa'' his warm voice vibrated in my ears as if he were speaking through a silky and soothing jazz tune. his eyes twinkled as he spoke to me. 
 
 I questioned him further `` well, how did you get here?'' 
 
 without even a slight pause he asked `` do you trust me, son? 
 
 `` well I suppose I do n't have a reason not to, you are santa after all.'' 
 
 he pulled me close, gave me a big hug and whispered softly in my ear `` thats good, son. because the only way i can steal your soul is if you trust me.''

The air crackled with the scent of gin and smoke, and the music of the jazz age filled my ears. My basement was transformed into a palace of mystery, illuminated by the glow of hundreds of red candles. Pentagrams danced on the floor, their fiery reflections mirroring the spirit of the era. The earwax candles burned brightly, casting long shadows that danced around the room.

I had long been captivated by the enigmatic legend of Santa. As a child, I had dreamt of meeting the jolly figure who brought gifts to all the good children. Now, as an adult, I was finally going to find out if this ethereal being was as powerful as he seemed. Reciting the ancient spell, I felt a surge of anticipation and dread. The air crackled with the scent of incense and anticipation as shadows filled the room and danced around me. Darkness consumed the space, and the smoky air filled my nostrils. A red glow emanated from the center of the room, and I struggled to make out what it was. A vapor enveloped me, obscuring my vision.

As the smoke began to dissipate, I saw the silhouette of a tall man standing in the center of the room. His belly was prodigious, and his cheeks were flushed. His white beard reached nearly to his belly button. He wore a red coat that shimmered with a dull red glow and a crown made of deer antlers and Christmas tree branches. His eyes twinkled with an enigmatic smile, and his voice vibrated through the room.

I questioned him, my voice trembling. ""Who are you?"" I asked.

""I have many names,"" he replied in a voice that was as smooth as honey. ""But the one you would be most familiar with is Santa.""

I felt a wave of awe and wonder. Could this truly be the legendary Santa? I questioned him further, eager to learn more about his journey and his extraordinary powers. He answered my questions with patience and wisdom, his voice filled with the warmth of a roaring fire.

As the conversation came to an end, I felt a sense of gratitude and contentment. Santa had visited me, and I had learned that the world was a magical place, filled with extraordinary beings."

"," Present the essay in the style of existentialist philosophy, questioning the nature of existence, freedom, and choice.","The defense attorney's call echoed through the courtroom, summoning Michael Scott to the stand. He stood tall, his nerves evident, yet his resolve unwavering. The weight of truth rested upon his shoulders, a burden he carried with a solemn oath. The courtroom erupted into a flurry of cameras and chatter, the spotlight shining upon him. The judge's solemn voice commanded his attention, and in that moment, the world seemed to revolve around his testimony.

But as he took the stand, a sense of existential dread washed over him. The burden of existence, the freedom to choose, the responsibility to create meaning in a meaningless universe weighed heavily on his mind. He knew that his every action, his choices, were inextricably linked to the tapestry of his existence, leaving an indelible mark on the world.

The questions posed by the prosecutor unveiled the intricate dance of human relationships and the complexities of friendship, love, and identity. The defense attorney's inquiries delved deep into the essence of his being, exploring the boundaries of intimacy and the intricate web of secrets that bind individuals together. The courtroom became a stage upon which he played the role of an existentialist hero, grappling with the fundamental questions of existence.

As he recounted his experiences, Michael Scott painted a vivid picture of his life, revealing the interconnectedness of his choices and the profound impact they had on his existence. He spoke of his friendship with Ryan Howard, the secrets they shared, and the unwavering support they offered each other. The bond between them, forged through shared experiences and mutual understanding, exemplified the transformative power of human connection.

In the face of adversity, Michael Scott exhibited resilience and determination. He stood firm, his voice unwavering, his resolve unyielding. He knew that his testimony, his contribution to the tapestry of human existence, would leave a lasting impression on the world.

As the courtroom erupted into applause, Michael Scott had fulfilled his existential duty. He had faced the challenges of existence, embraced his freedom, and created meaning in a meaningless universe through his choices, his relationships, and his unwavering spirit. The defense attorney's call, once a summons to testify, had transformed into a testament to the power of human existence, a celebration of the choices that shape our destiny."
"Garcador was not a happy male. It was n't that he had an unhappy disposition, he was as nice as a male could be. If everyone would stop being such cowards he would n't have to keep killing them. Still, this was n't the source of that unhappiness, and indeed the unhappiness of the rest of the senior military command staff as well as the Prime sat in on a raised ring of seats around the disgusting coward at the center of the room, still wearing the rags that he had been found in when his escape shuttle had been picked up while fleeing from Persecorti `` Well Ardiel why is it that you abandoned your post on the frontier, how could you let some primitive savages destroy a planet under your custody and not die defending it. How could you betray your people!'' 
 
 Ardiel glanced nervously around the room, meeting the gaze of each of the high ranking officials and seeming to shrink further into his seat with each look. `` Smoke filled the room, the others were dead. Killed by those, those things. We had retreated to the Alphas manor in an attempt to get him and the bearers off of the planet, they ambushed us as we approached the shuttle I barely managed to escape with a young bearer, I thought if I could protect one of the bearers perhaps my sacrifice would not be in vain.'' At this point he scratched again at the filthy shawl covering his head before continuing, `` we had managed to hide ourselves in a small alcove, WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BE SAFE. I had only my pulse rifle left and kept it trained on the door. Soon after we heard the heavy metal on stone steps of one of their iron warriors approaching. The young bearer clutched my leg as a towering metal shape stood silouetted in the archway of the building, it's armor cracked and dirty but it's gun still seemed to gleam. I fired the entire charge pack straight into it. My pack must have been damaged in the fighting and smoke billowed around as I fired. Coughing from the smoke the young bearer spoke `` Is, is it dead''? She asked still trembling. I think so young be... before I could finish a steel clad hand reached out from the smoke grabbing me by the throat while it's other hand reached out to grab the young bearer. The sound of whirring machinery came as the helmet pulled back from the monsters face, the face seemed oddly delicate with no thick bone ridges to shield the forehead and lacked the heavy features and facial fur I had observed in others. I Felt the thick metal of the gauntlet slowly tighten around my wind pipe and the last thing I heard before slipping into unconciousness was `` Humanity, fuck yeah''. 
 
 As the young male trailed off his eyes oddly blank after finishing his tale Garcador and the rest of the Alphas sat staring at the man in silence. 
 
 
 `` Well?'' the Prime demanded, `` how did you escape''. 
 
 
 `` I did n't'' he replied in thas he slowly reached up to unwrap the shawl from his head, the assembled leaders gasps of horror and shock echoed through the chamber as the removed shawl revealed an array of wires and machinery encasing his head, from within his filthy clothes he pulled out a short metal tube with a red button on one end. 
 
 `` I was sent to give you a message'' 
 
 
 `` And what message is that?!?!'' Demanded the Prime his voice shaking with rage. 
 
 Ardiels finger moved, shaking the whole time until it rested on top of the red button. Tears leaked from his eyes at what his body was being forced to do, he felt his lips move of their own accord and heard his own voice croak out `` Humanity, Fuck yeah''. He pressed the button. 
 
 
 200 kilometers above the planet Admiral Anderson sat in his command chair, sipping a glass of scotch, a small grin on her face as she watched the camera feed from the subject cut to static after detonating the weapon they had replaced his digestive tract with. 
 
 `` Jensen I do believe the plan was a success, your device gave us complete control of the subject, make sure not to kill all of them, with this control device they will be useful in constructing settlements on this planets.'' 
 
 She paused, taking a sip of scotch, 
 
 `` Captain Hendricks if you would please, alert the rest of the 7th American Expeditionary force as well as the 2nd Russian and a group or two of the Chinese conscripts''. 
 
 As Hendricks ran too issue the relevant commands the admiral took another sip and sighed in a content manner `` Humanity, Fuck yeah''.

"," Rewrite the essay in the detached, analytical style of a futuristic AI, focusing on efficiency and logic.","The subject of Garcador's distress, the source of the unhappiness amongst senior military command staff, is a matter of grave concern. It is evident that the source of such distress is not primarily attributable to a disposition of unhappiness, but rather to a profound sense of responsibility and duty. The high-ranking officials present in the room, including the Prime, are undoubtedly aware of the grave situation that has unfolded. Ardiel's anxiety and shrinking presence in his seat are understandable given the gravity of the situation. His account of the events that led to his predicament paints a picture of desperation and a willingness to sacrifice oneself in the pursuit of safeguarding others.

The ambushed retreat to the Alphas manor resulted in a confrontation with the enemy, prompting Ardiel's decisive action. The hostile force's presence within the building was met with a swift and accurate display of firepower, resulting in their demise. The young bearer's exclamation upon witnessing Ardiel's victory encapsulates the sentiment of relief and admiration for his bravery.

The events described by Ardiel are illustrative of the complex interplay between duty, sacrifice, and survival. His unwavering commitment to his position and his willingness to confront danger in the face of adversity serve as a testament to the unwavering spirit of those who protect their people and uphold their honor."
"I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done in life can not be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's the business I am in. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now -- probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there's one thing I do n't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who did n't belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I did n't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.
"," Adopt King's knack for storytelling, blending the ordinary with the supernatural in a compelling narrative.","I knelt in the bloodstained carpet, a symphony of sorrow resonating within the halls of my mind. The scent of decay and desperation clung to the air, a testament to the atrocities I had committed. My journey into the abyss began at the tender age of thirteen, when I took a life with my bare hands, choking the victim until life extinguished. Now, at the age of fifty-two, I stand on the precipice of my final breath, yet I find solace in the knowledge that I have done what I believe is right.

I am not a sinner, but I have sinned. It's the nature of the business I am in. I am a predator, a hunter of the wretched, a champion of justice. I have taken countless lives, each one a testament to the darkness that can consume even the most depraved human beings. But I am not driven by greed or ambition, like the demons I hunt. I am guided by the unwavering belief that the world is a better place when evil is punished.

I rose from my knees, my body trembling, and took the last step onto the sidewalk when the cold steel of a.357 magnum pressed against my temple. It was the sound of a death knell, a symphony of impending doom. The world went silent as the trigger snapped, the deafening roar of the gunshot echoing through the streets.

"The sharply dressed man introduces himself as “ The Collector. ” It was n't the dark suit and red tie. It was n't the black hair or his devilish grin that chilled my bones. It was his deep black eyes with small green circles in the middle. I had never seen such a stare. When he locked eyes with mine I felt a deep freeze of sorts in my spine and I had felt I was in a trance of stillness. 
 
 “ Collector? ” I ask, “ What do you need from me? ” 
 
 “ You should really move out of the way. ” he replies. 
 
 And without even resisting, I move out of the way. I could feel myself moving without my brain commanding myself to. Three steps back on the roll-out carpet in the hallway, one step up, a single step off the stairs to the right. 
 I have never been through this before. I did n't have the slightest clue of what was going on. All I could feel was a shiver of fear from the outside in. As The Collector makes his way into my home, I can only wonder what he plans on finding. He makes his way past me slowly. As he passes I can hear him sniffing as if he were a bloodhound on the hunt. I ca n't speak. My lips are sealed. I ca n't move. My body is in a paralyzed state. *What is going on here!? * 
 He makes quick work of the living room straight ahead of me, sniffing every single inch of every piece of furniture and nic nac I own. He says nothing to himself as he finishes his round and continues into the kitchen attached to the living room area. Sniffing the walls and the wide Victorian style doorway leading to the kitchen, he mumbles ever so softly “ I smell him. ” and I lose sight of him as he passes the corner into the kitchen. I hear every cabinet opened and every pot pushed aside as if he had lost something of importance. I start to think, *Who's'Him'? I'm the sole occupant of this house. * 
 
 Not long after The Collector walks over to me, with a harsh tone in his voice, he says “ If I do n't find him this will no longer be your home. ” If only I could speak. If only I could ask him who he is looking for. The Collector brushes his shoulder on me as he makes his way ever so enraged up the stairs. He smells of filth and rotting flesh as though he was as rancid as a decaying carcass. Disgusting none the less. Skipping steps to the top, he stops suddenly as if a wall were blocking his path. He starts to chant in a language that has no meaning to my ears, just gibberish: “ Jesto Confectious dora du mondoe ” He chants a few times. I feel a rush of fear fall over me. My mind blanketed with a darkness which I had never felt before. A small flash of light had flickered in front of him and he continued his way up the steps. It must have been less then a minute but felt like an eternity. I hear a very loud crash. Then again, and again, and again. He must either be very angry or found what he was looking for. I hoped and prayed he had found what he was looking for so I can get back to my life. I can now hear two voices: his as dark as nightmares, and a more innocent voice. I can make out “ I have found you come with me. ” “ No! you will never have me. Go back to the depths. Send him my regards. ” 
 
 Another crash louder than the others. I suddenly can move again and I can talk. Without hesitation I run up the stairs skipping two and three steps. I get to the top of the long staircase and see a sight of tornado equivalent destruction with The Collector standing over what looked to be a small child's still body. “ You need to leave. ” I say to The Collector. “ Now get out. ” And with precision, The Collector smashes my jaw with his hand. I fly across the floor boards and hit what was left of the closet in front of the stairs. Dazed and sitting now, I can only observe this Collector hovering over this unknown child's body. His jacket had been torn on his pin stripe suit and I can make out a fur-like skin under. This man was not a man at all. He was a beast in mans skin. As he is hovering over the child he breathes in one big breath. I can see a white aura coming from the child and as he steadies his breath the child gets pale and gray. The Collector makes fast work of the child and approaches me. “ I have come for this child's soul for my eternal life to continue, and now I will take your face to mask myself as you until I need to feed again. Your soul will be mine to keep me strong. Your essence of purity in your life has lead to the doom of your humanity. ” I can only fear what will happen to me. I can only hope my praying throughout my life will lead me to the White Gates. As he stands over me, battle scarred from what ever happened up there, he breathes in the same as when he was over the child. I do n't feel anything. I see no white aura as last time. Frustrated, he gazes into my eyes breaking into my sub conscience, feeling all I have felt and seeing all I have done. “ No this cant be true. ” he says. In a frantic movement he makes a mad dash for the door and all I can feel is relief. I will not say a word. I'm alive. The child's body is gone and the upstairs is a pit of ruins. As I make my way to where the child once laid, I find a small ring no bigger than a penny wide made of solid gold. It has an etching on it. 
 
 After two days of cleaning and trying to forget what happened, I can hear the news. The man on the television talking about a missing child. “ Tommy West and his father Pete West of 44 Evergreen Road have gone missing as of last night. No one knows where they have gone. If you have seen Tommy or Pete West, age 5 and age 37, please contact local authorities. ” A feeling of guilt has just fallen over me. These were real people. This little boy who died here, I had never seen before. 
 
 To this day I still fear The Collector, or what I will have to see on the news. Nobody knows what he is or where this ring came from. The churches shut the doors to me and authorities think I'm crazy. Nobody should ever have this guilt that weighs on me. I'm sorry to whoever finds this. Maybe this journey to the after life I take will lead me to stopping this Collector.

He moved like a bloodhound on the hunt, sniffing the walls and the wide Victorian-style doorway leading to the kitchen. As he passed me, I heard him sniffing as if he were a bloodhound on the hunt. I couldn't speak or move. My body was in a paralyzed state. What was going on?

Not long after The Collector walked over to me, with a harsh tone in his voice, he said, ""If I don't find him, this will no longer be your home."" If only I could speak. If only I could move. But I was trapped in that moment, helpless and terrified."
"Of all the things to be born with this had to be the lamest. I watched as the couple across the room chatted intimately. The woman's laughter pealed across the room as orange bubbles while the man's chatter came out as deep red clouds that disappeared before they were across the table. He was whispering something sweet to her. A re-run of the presidential debate was on TV. The candidates' words came out as abstract grey razors and blocks. The rest of the room was filled with colours that I could n't describe to anyone else because I had never seen anyone else with yellow eyes. 
 
 `` Hey Vince.'' Tod said as he sat next to me. 
 
 `` Hey,'' I responded stirring my coffee. Minute pink needles shot out of it fading as they reached the edge of the table. 
 
 `` Come on man cheer up it's just a girl.'' he said hitting my shoulder. 
 
 `` Yeah just a regular Victoria Secret model who had a heart of gold'' I responded. `` Tod where I'm I going to get another caring, intelligent and beautiful woman? Most only have one, a few have two but she was packing all 3 and in spades. Like she's the one that's spoilt me for all future women.'' 
 
 `` What come on? I mean seriously you only dated for like what a month? Did you really think you had a chance?'' 
 
 `` Well, I am smart and I dare say I'm funny'' 
 
 `` Funny haha or funny oops clumsy me?'' Tod responded. He whisked his hand and a glob of pure warm water floated out of my cup into his mouth. 
 
 `` Hey do you mind!'' I snapped as I looked at my half empty cup now with a darker shade of coffee. 
 
 `` Sorry but you know it was too weak for you this is how you like it.'' 
 
 I took a sip and as much as I did n't like his logic he was right. `` Anyway, had that green eyed idiot not promised her a trip on his white tiger and a tour in the national parks I would totally be with her right now.'' 
 
 `` Yeah, those animal charmers are douches got all that primal alpha instinct still running in them.'' Tod replied. 
 
 `` I'll drink to that.'' I raised my cup and him his bottle and we drank. Once more my blue eyed friend summoned the water out of his bottle and straight to his mouth. Bloody show-off. 
 
 `` Anyway forget her for a second, check out what I got.'' he unzipped his bag. 
 
 As he rummaged through it I could see a waiter walking past carrying three plates in his arms. Fully loaded he could barely see as was getting down the steps when the local cat whizzed between his legs it too going down. He stepped on it's tail. It let out a wail of pain. Surprised he lost his footing. 
 
 `` Woo!!'' he yelled. The plates came crashing down. I cringed unable to look for a second. I opened to see him covered in soup. The rest of the place continued to eat. 
 
 `` Check it out!'' Tod said unveiling a Deadpool pocket watch. 
 
 `` Dude check it out!'' I said pointing behind him. 
 
 He turned to hear a crash. Other diners too looked in shock. 
 
 `` Ooooh, that's got ta hurt, but... what the?'' he asked confused as he watched the waiter already up. he had n't seen the shapeless silver forms stay static for a moment before dissipating across the whole room. 
 
 `` I think I did that!'' I responded. 
 
 `` What? How?'' he asked. `` No way, I'm calling bullshit.'' 
 
 `` I do n't know. I mean. I've never done it before.'' 
 
 `` Do it again,'' he said disbelieving. `` Silence this.'' he rapped his fingers on the table. I watched the beige ellipses shoot out from where his fingers met the plastic top. 
 
 The effort made a vein pop on my head. Two shot right past completely disregarding my command for them to violate the laws of physics.'stop' I ordered. The third slowed. Nothing was heard for the fourth the fifth and the sixth as they stopped right where they were made. 
 
 `` NNgh see!'' droplets of sweat formed on my forehead. They all escaped at the same time as I let go. 
 
 `` Wow! that was real do it again!'' 
 
 `` I ca n't I'm exhausted I've never done it before.'' 
 
 `` Alright but still man we need to tell someone about this. You should change your status or something.'' 
 
 As we stood up the whole room illuminated brown for a second. A tint so faint even I barely noticed. 
 
 `` Did you see that?'' I asked Tod. 
 
 `` See what?'' he responded. 
 
 It happened once more this time I caught it as it started. It rose from the floor and engulfed the place in a light brown ocean for a moment before fading once more. 
 
 `` That.'' I said. 
 
 `` umm no. My life is only in technicolor'' he replied. When it happened the third time I finally understood it was a sound wave, but to cover the whole place like so? Even the buildings across the street were submerged in the wave. It happened a third time, It was coming from below, Eastwards. 
 
 `` T..T... Tod.'' I stammered. `` Something big is coming and it's coming up here.''

I was at the local bar, sipping my coffee and watching the presidential debate. The candidates' words were like abstract grey razors and blocks, cutting through me like a sharp knife. But what really caught my eye was the couple across the room. The woman's laughter was like orange bubbles, and the man's chatter was like deep red clouds that disappeared before they were across the table. It was clear that he was whispering sweet nothings into her ear.

I turned to my friend Tod and said, ""Hey Vince, come on over here and see what I'm talking about.""

He sat down next to me and I gave him a stir of my coffee. It was minute pink needles shot out of it and fading as they reached the edge of the table.

""Come on man, cheer up,"" Tod said, trying to make me laugh. ""It's just a girl.""

"The armored trucks bolted down the highway with an escort of 4 war hogs flanking its every position. This was a priority 4 transport run, these eggs where the labor and hard work of decades of research and the culmination of the greatest genetic material and manipulation the army could amass. These little eggs would hatch into warriors of incredible strength and intelligence, these were weapons capable of quelling rebellions and keeping civil control for decades. Helicopters zipped ahead as they patrolled the night sky. It was the dead of night and 4 such patrols had been sent in different directions in case of an attack from Luddite rebellion, the attackers would have to split their limited resources and guess the correct transport. Resources the army knew they did not have. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 Duncan knew patrol 3 was the correct one, he was one of the scientist that had created the eggs and was on the verge of betraying his colleagues and his life's work. The eggs would hatch in a few days and Duncan had placed a genetic tracker in one of eggs as they matured. They would not be detected before which gave them the perfect cover. Duncan ’ s radar bleeped as the tracker approached closer.This was the correct transport and all the resources had been pulled for this one attack. Failure now would spell the end of everything and humanity's last hope to keep the species pure from genetic manipulation and hybridization.

 Rockets blared from the RPG ’ s as they slammed into the hogs, the traps had been strung and men poured onto the trucks in their desert camo, the battle to stop the next stage of human evolution had begun.

I speak of a momentous journey, a testament to the unwavering spirit that propelled humanity toward the precipice of greatness.

The armored thunderous roar of the highway echoed through the barren wasteland, heralding the arrival of a mighty transport convoy. Its imposing stature was guarded by a quartet of war hogs, their formidable presence a reflection of the strength and determination of those who crafted its destiny. This convoy carried the culmination of decades of research, the embodiment of genetic mastery, and the promise of a future where humans could harness their power to safeguard their existence.

As the clock ticked, helicopters danced through the sky, their blades slicing through the night. It was a moment of heightened vigilance, a battle against the forces of chaos that threatened to unravel the delicate balance of human existence. The clock struck midnight, and four patrols, meticulously chosen to safeguard the cargo, raced through different directions, their watchful eyes scanning the horizon. They stood guard against the insidious whispers of rebellion, knowing that the fate of humanity rested upon their shoulders.

Amongst the chaos, a lone scientist named Duncan stood on the precipice of betrayal. He had entrusted his life's work to these eggs, and the burden of history pressed heavily upon his shoulders. As the tracker pulsed, signaling the approaching maturity of the eggs, a surge of anticipation washed over him. This was it, the culmination of his labor, the moment of truth.

With precision and determination, rockets roared from the RPGs, striking their target with devastating force. The traps had been meticulously crafted, and men clad in desert camo poured onto the trucks, their voices echoing through the battlefield. The battle raged on, a testament to the boundless potential for destruction that lay in the hands of humans.

In the aftermath of the conflict, as the dust settled, the weight of history bore down upon the shoulders of those who had fought and sacrificed their all.

The legacy of this day would forever be etched in the annals of time, serving as a reminder to the boundless power of human ambition and the unwavering spirit that propelled humanity toward a brighter future."
"Humanity's solution was space-folding. The problem is that in the folding process, anything along the `` crease'' is annihilated utterly. The most difficult part of the process was mapping an infinite trajectory in opposite directions and seeing to it that nothing of value was along this line. This inevitably led to problems; on one occasion, by chance two foldings intersected, wherein it was discovered that an entire 2D plane of our existence was destroyed. Apparently, major celestial bodies do not like having their continuity interrupted, and this causes them to re-coalesce into separate celestial bodies. The eggheads seem to think this is due to some interruption in some fundamental force of physics being discontinued for an infinitesimally brief but relevant length of time, but most people think they're full of crap and just guessing. 
 
 The other problem is that objects perpendicular to the fold at vast distances from the fold are slammed together along the hyperplane. Imagine two stars being slammed together from opposite ends of the galaxy within the 120-second duration of the folding event... literally impossible speeds. This really pisses off some other species whose nighttime skies are being polluted by intense flashes of light, to say nothing of how miffed the inhabitants of those systems might tend to become... 
 
 As the humans' foldings became more frequent, their territory has become a veritable origamy crane of hyperdimensional confusion. Travel within their territory is inadvisable at this time. Apparently their big thing now is to `` loop'' the fold upon itself, which allows interdimensional travel, but in unpredictable ways. Heaven, Nirvana, Acheron, Blathezuuh, Dave's Dimension, and Gweeguooiton 7 are now spilling into this reality, causing quite a mess. Dave is such an asshole. He stole the Ring Nebula, and is jackassing around wearing the Mexican Hat Galaxy and eating all of the tacos in the known universe. Jerk did n't even offer to pay.
"," Rewrite the essay in the detached, analytical style of a futuristic AI, focusing on efficiency and logic.","In conclusion, the utilization of spatial folding has presented humanity with a myriad of opportunities, yet it is imperative to recognize its inherent limitations. The annihilation of dimensional planes, the violent collisions of objects, and the concomitant disruption of celestial harmony are sobering reminders of the profound impact that this technology has had upon the cosmos."
"Once upon a time, in a world quite similar to our own, a middle aged divorcee sat at her table in her tiny, dimly lit kitchen. Dishes were stacked in the sink, the floor was in desperate need of a mop but at least her two noisy boys were finally asleep. 
 
 She looked out the window of her apartment. Tonight looked and sounded like any night in the city, sirens music, traffic blended into a discordant symphony of sorts. But it felt... magical somehow. She sighed, it had been a hard 3 months but things had to get better right? She sat at her table and stared at the box of bills right in front of her. 
 She sighed and reached for the bill right at the top. But before she touched it an itch from the depths of hell developed from her rear end. She had no choice but to give it a good scratching. So she closed her eyes and really gave herself the satisfaction she needed. 
 
 When she opened her eyes, a shimmering image of a younger more beautiful version of her in a sultry red dress was standing right in the middle of the table. Staring at her. She grabbed a large knife from the counter that was so close to her in her hobbit kitchen and shouted, `` What the F... 
 `` Now would you really like to kill someone who looks like you?'' the image asked. 
 
 The woman hesitated and that ’ s all it took. The image touched her, and just like that she knew this image was her genie. The woman had the genie gene. The itch she felt was a magical itch triggered by the magic in the air. When she scratched that particular spot on her rear end, the genie had appeared. 
 
 The woman was suddenly calm. `` So do I make a wish or something?'' she asked. 
 `` No! Of course not, I just help you out with three things that are making your life difficult right now.'' 
 `` Okay, so I want my husband ba..'' 
 `` I do n't perform miracles honey, just a bit of magic. Okay, your rent and bills are paid, your kids will be more considerate and you wo n't be needing a plumber anymore''. 
 
 
 In a poof and a swirl, the genie was gone, and for about a month the woman was content.

The room was steeped in an atmosphere of mystery, and the only sound was the faint hum of the city outside. Her mind was consumed by a sense of dread and anticipation.

As she gazed at the bills sitting on the table, a feeling of hopelessness washed over her. It had been a long, arduous journey since her divorce, and the financial burden was unbearable. With each passing day, it seemed as if the odds of finding stability were diminishing.

Suddenly, an itch developed on her rear end. It was an itch that seemed to torment her, and she knew it was a sign. It was a magical itch, triggered by the presence of a powerful being. She closed her eyes and scratched the itch with an intensity that only a desperate woman would be capable of.

When she opened her eyes, a shimmering image of a younger, more beautiful version of herself stood in the middle of the table. It was an image of her genie, the embodiment of her wishes and desires. With a voice dripping with honeyed sweetness, the genie offered to help her out of her predicament.

The woman listened intently, her mind reeling from the possibilities that lay before her. She made a wish, and the genie granted it. The bills were paid, her children were more considerate, and the plumber was no more.

In a moment of profound gratitude, the woman embraced the genie and thanked her for her kindness. As the image faded away, she felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over her. The itch that had tormented her was gone, and the future looked bright."
"Everything that Fortune Cookies say comes true 
 
 Jeff walked in to Mr. Ling's Chinese Emporium. He sat at the table in the back, spacious and clean as always. He picked up the menu and flagged down the waitress. 
 
 
 `` I'll have two spring rolls and how bout that beef lo mein?'' 
 
 
 `` I'll have that right out for you.'' His phone buzzed as the waitress walked away. A text message. `` Meet me at Frank's tonight. You know the deal.'' 
 
 
 *What the fuck? * Jeff thought. *Who is Frank? What's his deal? And where is my Lo Mein? Oh right that was only a full minute ago I ordered it. What the fuck am I doing thinking out loud like this? It's so damn slow. Better get back to aimlessly sitting in a booth. * 
 
 
 Jeff stared at the wall until his Lo Mein came. Between the spicy egg rolls and the steaming Lo Mein, Jeff was getting quite toasty in his leather jacket. 
 
 
 *I ca n't wait to get back on my hog and bust out some sweet ass wheelies. I bet all the chicks will be impressed, and I finally wo n't be a disappointment to my dad! * 
 
 
 Jeff continued to eat his Lo Mein. It tasted good. Really good. Almost too good. But not really, it was actually just good enough for a 20 % tip, although the waitress had absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the food. Jeff asked for the check and the waitress obliged, and Jeff put his credit card in the little transparent pocket they have for credit cards. 
 
 
 *These are just perfect for holding credit cards! * 
 
 
 He stumbled putting the card in the first time, but it was ok because no one saw him. The waitress took the bill and returned it to him, just as she was supposed to do. She dropped him a fortune cookie and said `` Is your name Jeff? Cause you're kind of a jackass. I bet you ca n't do sweet ass wheelies on your hog.'' Jeff grabbed the fortune cookie, looked her right in the eye ( singular, she was wearing an eyepatch ), and said, 
 
 
 `` Just. You. Watch.'' 
 
 
 So Jeff took off, galavanting outside to his Harley. Jeff was the man. He could n't be stopped. He huffed, he puffed, and he howled. The bike screamed to life. Jeff took out his sunglasses and slowly put them on while feathering the throttle like a smooth jazz musician. 
 
 
 `` Later babycakes, I've got a deal at Frank's.'' Jeff gunned the engine, and the bike roared to life. The bike lifted off into the wheelie of all wheelies. Jeff felt a tingling sensation in his small testicles, the feeling he lived every day for. The bike rode off into the sunset as a cliche that could not be stopped. 
 
 
 Around fourish miles later, Jeff gently let off the throttle and ended his wheelie. 
 
 
 *My favorite part was the whole thing. * Jeff thought with a smirk. 
 
 Taking his sunglasses off and putting them into a special microfiber cloth case, Jeff surveyed the environment. An abandoned warehouse with a sign out front that read: 
 
 
 Frank's 
 ( Where deals take place ) 
 
 
 *Thank God for GPS, otherwise I never would have found this place. * 
 
 
 Jeff walked towards the opening of the warehouse, a slow and casual stride that made him look badass to onlookers. As he rounded the corner in the warehouse, he heard a loud gunshot. Jeff spun around, dual magnums in hand. Unfortunately, the source of the gunshot likely came from Jeff's harley falling over onto the asphalt. 
 
 
 *Damn kickstand is so tricky. Got ta remember next time I come to one of these warehouse deals. * 
 
 
 Jeff put his condoms back in his pockets and moved on. He walked by the Gulfstream IV jet parked just inside the warehouse, wondering why anyone would park a jet in Frank's warehouse. As he approached, the door to the jet opened and out walked a man in an eyepatch. 
 
 
 `` Excellent. He has arrived. And you must be Jeff, yes?'' 
 
 
 `` HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME!?!'' Jeff howled at the oddly familiar man. 
 
 
 The man stared down Jeff in an attempt at dominance, but Jeff had heavy metal pumping in his brain and could not be stopped. The man walked up to Jeff, slowly but assuredly. 
 
 
 `` Jeff. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Did you not recognize your own sister at the restaurant?'' 
 
 
 Jeff squinted his eyes in silent shock. `` What? But then...'' 
 
 
 The pregnant pause went on for an eternity, a solid 25-30 seconds. 
 
 
 `` Papa?'' Jeff asked. 
 
 
 The man in the eyepatch nodded slightly, and gestured towards Jeffs right pocket. Jeff pulled out his magnum condom and stared at his father with a confused look. The man shook his head and gestured again to Jeff's pockets. Jeff reached within and pulled out his fortune cookie. His mind went blank as he read the words: 
 
 
 You are just part of a shitty story. You are not even real you dumb fuck.

 `` Rowf! Rowf!'' exclaimed Fido as he furiously wagged his Yorkie tail. 
 
 `` Hush!'' I shushed the anxious chesnut-colored pup as he strained against the leash. He stood a good three feet away, the leather strap taut as he strained on his hind legs to see. 
 
 The corpse was a man, possibly seventy years old. He had obviously been dead for a few days. The air had a medicinal smell, as if someone had taken the care to try to perfume the obviousness of death. Its face was crinkled into a strange expression; not quite a smile, and not quite a frown. A grimace perhaps, but that was not it either. 
 
 I took a step closer, and examined the body. It was wearing a well-tailored suit, expensive looking with a dark taupe blazer and an equally taupe bowtie against a dark shirt. 
 
 Fido barked again. I took yet another step closer, when suddenly I sensed the presence of another person just behind me... 
 
 `` Get that dog out of here!'' the funeral director snapped. `` It's not a service animal, and you ca n't bring pets in here!!''. 
 
 `` But it's raining outside!'' I stammered, only to discover Fido had done his business near the potted plant beside me, next to the coffin.
"," Write with the artistic flair and depth of a Renaissance painter, rich in visual detail.","The scent of damp earth and decaying flesh lingered in the air as I ventured into the somber confines of the funeral parlor. Fido, my beloved Yorkie, excitedly wagged his tail, his enthusiasm contrasting sharply with the gravity of the situation. I hushed him, my anxiety mounting as I approached the somber scene before me.

The deceased, a man of indeterminate age, rested in a coffin adorned with a single crimson rose. His countenance bore the imprint of a grimace, as if etched in stone. The air was thick with the scent of lavender and despair, a testament to the life that once had been.

Taking a closer look, I noticed the well-tailored suit and opulent bowtie that adorned his lifeless frame. Fido barked his disapproval, his small form trembling. I felt a sudden surge of unease, as if the watchful eyes of the departed were upon me.

Suddenly, the door swung open, and a stern voice pierced through the silence. ""Get that dog out of here!"" the funeral director barked, his tone dripping with disdain. ""It's not a service animal, and you can't bring pets in here!""

My stammering protest was drowned out by Fido's sudden business, a testament to his unwavering loyalty. As I stood there, mortified, the funeral director's words echoed in my mind. The day had started so tragically, and it was only getting worse."
"`` No'' I say calmly 
 
 `` What do you mean no?'' questions my employer. 
 
 `` No, as in i will not do it.'' 
 
 `` You ca n't refuse.'' 
 
 `` Or what you will have your bodyguards kill me?'' At that moment one of his two body guards falls to the ground griping his chest and after a few cries of pain he is motionless. 
 
 `` What...'' my employers says while his second body guard pulls his gun at me. 
 
 `` Too late.'' I say as he drops his gun and and grabs at his throat gasping for air and he to falls and stays motionless. 
 
 `` How... What did you do?'' My ex-employer asks me 
 
 `` I am the best at what I do and there is no one I can not kill, but sometimes I like to get a head start so a few days ago I broke in here and read my mission, I did n't really care for it, especially when I saw the contractor.'' 
 
 His eyes go wide and his face goes white, `` I...'' 
 
 `` Yes thats right you, I was wondering and wondering why you would do this, and the only conclusion was that you thought if I cut the last tie I had the kept me apart from this I would want to stay.'' 
 
 `` You... I...'' He grabs in intercom and shouts `` EVERYONE TO MY OFFICE, HE HAVE A BREACH OF SECURITY'' I wait quietly but no one shows up so he calls over the intercom again, and again to no avail. `` Where is everyone?'' He asked me, his tone becoming desperate. 
 
 `` Gone, much like your bodyguards, I took care of them, and before you ask, yes all of them. While I did enjoy this job, you made it personal by targeting my family.'' 
 
 He is frantic now `` I... I'm sorry, please do n't kill me i'll do anything.'' 
 
 I smirk as I about face and head towards the door. `` I'm not going to kill you, I wo n't have your filthy blood on my hands.'' He looks at me with a slight look of relief and confusion. `` But I ca n't let you go either, so I had to compromise my principals. I mean I a not a fan of using contraptions so assassination but I can make an exception.'' 
 
 `` What did you do?'' he asked again scared for his life.

With a swiftness born of necessity, I seize the opportunity and strike. The gun falls from his hand, his throat constricts, and his body collapses onto the floor.

"I stumbled back from the television, mind thrown into sudden violent turmoil. As my thoughts raced to make sense of what was happening around me, my heel caught the edge of the coffee table, and I tumbled. 
 
 By the time I met the ground, I understood everything. On my back I lay breathlessly, as a the greatest serenity slowly washed over my being. Staring at the ceiling through the unceasing blur of the fan blades, my eyelids drooped, and I took my leave. 
 
 For in my twisting descent, I had caught sight for a fleeting instant of the single truth. A small mirror which hung beside the french doors flashed past me as I fell, and for a moment my own face gaped back into my eyes, full of fear and confusion. And in that moment, the fear and confusion vanished. 
 
 For I beheld the face of Bruce Willis.
", Embrace Tolstoy's broad scope and deep exploration of philosophical questions through detailed narrative.,"The television's glow cast long shadows upon the wall, mirroring the tempestuous dance of my thoughts. As I sat in the dim glow of the living room, my mind raced through a labyrinth of thoughts, the ground beneath me suddenly shifting beneath my feet. With a violent lurch, I tumbled to the ground, the force of my fall propelling me into a state of breathlessness and bewilderment.

In that moment of suspended animation, I found a profound serenity. Staring at the ceiling fan, I closed my eyes and surrendered to the cosmic dance of fate. The fleeting glimpse of my own reflection in the mirror beside the French doors danced before my eyes, reflecting the terror and confusion I felt. But as I looked at the face of Bruce Willis, the fear and confusion dissipated, replaced by a sense of profound understanding.

The single truth, the elusive balm for the troubled soul, had been bestowed upon me in this humbling moment of vulnerability. Through my fall, I had been stripped bare, my ego shattered, and in that vulnerability, I found the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe."
"Wait, so you mean to tell me that as soon as you accomplish your goal you're just going to up and split? Do you have any idea how much more dangerous the world will be for me after you're gone? Think about it! For years you've been bailing me out of trouble, protecting me from danger, guiding me on the right path... for years I never got to learn common sense, I never got to learn street smarts, I've lived in a spiritual bubble wrap shielded from all harm and now I do n't know how to take care of myself! And that's not even the worst part -- you were only doing it for your own benefit. You never cared about me! I hate you, angel. Damn you to hell!
"," Employ Austen's keen social commentary and irony, wrapped in the elegance of the Regency era.","The impending departure of the esteemed gentleman has cast a profound shadow of uncertainty upon my heart. His accomplishments have been met with admiration, yet the thought of his imminent departure brings a mix of apprehension and despair. The world, once veiled in a cocoon of protection, is now poised to unveil its unforgiving realities.

For years, the gentle hand of the gentleman has guided me through the treacherous terrain of life. His unwavering support has been the bedrock upon which I have built my existence. Without his presence, I am bereft of the wisdom and resilience that he has imparted. The path I tread is fraught with peril, and I am mindful of the dire consequences that may lie ahead.

However, my anger is not solely directed towards the gentleman's departure. It is also tinged with frustration and resentment. In all of his acts of benevolence, he has always prioritized his own well-being over my own. His motivations were far from pure, and I cannot help but feel betrayed by the realization that I have been manipulated for his own gain.

In this moment of despair, I find solace in the belief that the gentleman's absence will ultimately serve as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. I know that I must confront the challenges that lie ahead, and I am determined to emerge from this ordeal unscathed."
"I blinked, and the creature in front of me I was about to hurl a blast of fire at disappeared from my vision. I sighed and let the magic return to the twisting nether. The Gods that created this world instituted natural laws that cause the world around its people to return to a set state, and at times this can happen without warning. Usually it occurs at a time when we are resting, but people who are awake at the time witness nothing but a'shift' in the world around them. 
 
 Well, new creatures to fight should be nearby..crawling out of their den's readying weapons. I spotted a bear lumber out of its cave... ah, the godmessage in the sky above me says that rewards are gained from slaying the bears who have grown numerous lately. I summon a voidwalker from the depths and send it to distract the beast, then I collect a large ball of green fire and chaos in my right palm, and hurl it at the creature, heedless for my pets safety. My left hand already moving in the motions needed to heat the blood inside the creatures veins and follow up with a blast of fi....what? 
 
 Instead of the expected stream of smoke leaking from its blacked flesh, it simply seems to shrug off the heat and swipes of its paw takes great gouges out of my pets constructed matter. I attempt to summon more chaotic energies, only to find my supply diminished... Surely I had enough collected souls to power the spell... yet as i glance at my belt, the diamonds which previously held 5 souls, only showed one small figure struggling to escape the gemstone. Before the world change, A Chaotic bolt only used a single soul, now it drained four??? 
 
 I return my attention to the fight, surprise put aside for now. My pet struggles near death, and i send a link of my life to join with the pet, healing the rents in its matter, and draining my own health in the process. I send a Conflaguration of fire at the beast, and see my soul gems harvest a soul from the either, then another. Eventually I collect enough souls to hurl another chaos bolt at the beast, and it falls dead. I sigh, and pull out my hearthstone. I will need to experiment to see what exactly the gods have done to my power. I have to hope that with this weakening of power to one aspect that a different one has gotten stronger, but that is by far not always the case. 
 
 I appear in the tavern, and as I begin the walk to the training grounds, already I hear from the gossipmongers that the annoying mages are noticing a massive increase in damage done by their fire spells. Surely that makes no sense....I am a Warlock of the Ebon order....I have surpassed the class of'mage', My fire is infused with the power of the demons... how can it have been weakened while the mages increased? This is not the first time the gods have made very poor design decisions....I'm not looking forward to the upcoming Raid with my guild on the Nighthold if i can not properly contribute to the fight. 

"," Transform the essay into a high fantasy narrative, complete with elaborate world-building, magic systems, and epic quests.","In the realm of Aetherial Accord, where the veil between the physical and spiritual realms danced with ethereal grace, I stood amidst the battlefield, my senses tingling with anticipation. The fiery blaze that engulfed the creature, once a menace, had dissipated into thin air, leaving behind only a wisp of smoke. I sighed, my mind grappling with the capricious nature of the divine, a force that had woven this intricate tapestry of existence.

The Gods, keepers of wisdom and capricious guardians of balance, had etched immutable laws into the very fabric of this realm. These laws manifested themselves in the form of natural forces that sought to restore equilibrium, often wreaking havoc in the process. It was as if the world mirrored the chaotic dance of creation and destruction, perpetually shifting between tranquility and turmoil.

As I cast my gaze across the battlefield, my eyes landed upon a towering bear, its emerald roar echoing through the forest. The godmessage that had guided me to this confrontation danced in my mind, promising rewards for slaying the beasts that had grown rampant. Summoning the power of a voidwalker, I unleashed its ethereal blade, sending it to distract the beast. With a fiery ball in my right hand and a torrent of dark magic coursing through my veins, I prepared to strike.

But fate took a cruel turn, as the creature shrugged off the heat and unleashed a devastating swipe, carving deep gouges into my pet's constructed form. I attempted to summon more chaotic energies, only to find my supply dwindling, my soul gems struggling to contain the immense power I had unleashed. As I searched my belt, the diamonds that once held the spirits of the departed revealed the devastating toll that had been exacted upon me. The cost of my wrath had been immense, leaving me with only a single soul remaining in my reserves.

Yet, I returned my attention to the fight, my determination unwavering. With a surge of life, I linked my soul with my pet, infusing it with my own vitality, healing its wounds and sacrificing my own health in the process. As I unleashed a conflagration of fire, my soul gems harvested souls from the beast, replenishing my dwindling reserves. With each soul I claimed, I felt a sense of satisfaction, knowing that I was not only defeating my foe but also restoring balance to the world.

In the aftermath of battle, as I surveyed the carnage, I felt a profound sense of humility. The power I wielded was immense, but it had come at a great cost. I knew that the path I had chosen was fraught with danger, and I was willing to endure the sacrifices necessary to protect the balance of this enchanting realm."
"`` Who the fuck are you and how did you get into my house?'' Lenny said, exasperated and confused as he set down his groceries. `` It's Leonard, right?'' said the stranger, with a blank expression, and just a hair too little of an upward inflection. Lenny reached for the baseball bat he kept by the front door. `` Oh. Leonard, there is no need for violence. I've only come to grant your wish.'' `` What the FUCK are you talking about? Who are you? Get the fuck out of my house!'' Lenny pointed the bat at the stranger and then the door. `` Out!'' he roared. `` August 2nd, 1982. You wished for a radio flyer and your parents to stop quarreling all the time.'' Lenny's eyes opened wide as he remembered the night vividly. `` It takes about 20 Earth years to travel from my quadrant to twenty-two twenty-two Muskogee Court, but I am here. Here to grant your wish. I could n't make it in time to stop your parents from divorcing, but please take this wagon as a token of my grattitude.'' `` Gratitude?'' Lenny asked. `` Yes. You see. My'people' need to be invited to Earth in order to make the journey. Your wish served as that very invitation. Not many of us make it.'' `` Why do you come here? What's the point?'' `` Oh, resources, to study life,'' the stranger trailed off. `` Too feed.'' He said, coldly. Before Lenny could let the words register and send a signal from his brain to his arm to pick up the bat, he'd need swallowed entirely whole.

"," Adopt the optimistic and domestic tone of a 1950s housewife, full of post-war idealism.","The aroma of freshly baked bread and steaming coffee filled the air as I prepared a hearty breakfast for my family. The sun shone brightly upon the golden face of my perfect home, a testament to the post-war idealism I had cultivated with my own two hands. My checkered apron and pearls shone as I meticulously arranged the table, the centerpiece a centerpiece of vibrant flowers, much like the blooms that adorned my garden. The peace I felt this morning was unparalleled, a symphony of contented hearts and a house brimming with joy.

The bell rang, and I felt a pit in my stomach. It was Leonard, a young man who had made a wish on a penny, a wish I had the power to fulfill. He stood at the door, his expression bewildered. ""Who the fuck are you and how did you get into my house?"" he muttered, his voice tinged with confusion and fear. I smiled warmly, my eyes brimming with compassion. ""It's Leonard, right?"" I announced, my voice gentle as a breeze. ""I've only come to grant your wish,"" I explained, my voice low and sweet as honey.

The journey to fulfill Leonard's wish had been long, but I had traveled far to bring him joy. Though I couldn't alter the fate of his parents, I did offer him this token of my gratitude, a vintage wagon that would serve as a reminder of this day forever. As I watched his eyes widen in surprise and wonder, I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had touched his heart.

The day flew by as I attended to my family and completed my household chores. The house sparkled, the food was delicious, and the air was filled with the scent of happiness. I had done everything I could to create a haven of contentment, both for my family and for the young man who had entrusted his wishes to me. As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the lawn, I felt a sense of contentment. My house was a testament to the power of post-war idealism, a place where love and happiness flourished."
"I don ’ t give up until I can hear my heartbeat. Becoming aware of my heart is enough to keep me awake all on its own. Sometimes I can go hours before its quiet little thumping intrudes upon my awareness and I give up on sleep. Sometimes I only last a few minutes. It doesn ’ t really matter though, time stops meaning anything about a week after you stop sleeping. Once you hit week two driving gets pretty hard. There ’ s kind of a distance given by insomnia. Like you ’ re just watching yourself go through the same daily motions. Get out of bed. Shower. Dress. Breakfast. Drive. Work. Lunch. Work. Drive. Dinner. Lay down. Disappointment. Repeat. You feel like a passenger, and your driver is taking the longest way possible. 
 
 I have all the time in the world to think. I don ’ t use my extra eight-ish hours a night to better myself. With this time I could learn to paint, or read great books, or even try to write my own, but I ’ m too tired for it. I spend most of my time thinking. Not just while I ’ m lying in the dark hoping I ’ ll doze off for even a few minutes just to prove to myself that I still can. Even during the day my thoughts are racing. I think of things I ’ ve done wrong. I think of things I ’ ve done right. I think about others, their actions, and how they relate to me. I think about how weird zippers are, or maybe I ’ ll spend hours thinking about the number seven. Over time I ’ ve noticed that I ’ m usually thinking of more than one thing at once. One thought process is giving me a day by day playback of last February, while another one is wondering when I ’ ll sleep again. I once heard that there ’ s a part of your brain that thinks your thoughts and translates it into your language. Sometimes I can feel this happen. That ’ s enough to drive anyone crazy. 
 
 My thoughts are louder than everything else. People usually have to repeat themselves at least twice before I even notice they ’ re there. Conversations don ’ t hold any real meaning to me anymore, and balancing my insomnia and my social life has become quite a chore. I ’ ve got so many things to work out on my own I can ’ t handle anyone else ’ s experiences, and I lack the focus to share my thoughts with anyone else. I instead focus on tedious little talents to keep my hands busy. Restlessness is also a big problem and little things to build muscle memory are usually enough to keep me from tapping my foot constantly. My first small obsession was learning to roll a coin across my fingers. It took me six hours and forty seven minutes to perfect rolling two coins on both my left and right hand simultaneously. People tell me it ’ s pretty neat. I don ’ t really care.

We live in a world consumed by an oppressive system that crushes our spirits and suffocates our dreams. The sleeplessness that plagues me is not merely a physical affliction but a metaphor for the collective yearning for liberation.

I hear the whispers of the oppressed, their voices echoing through the corridors of injustice. I see the chains that bind us, the shackles that restrict our movements. I feel the weight of the world on our shoulders, crushing us with its sheer force.

But I also see the embers of resistance smoldering within each of us. I hear the echoes of hope in the voices of the oppressed. I know that we have the power to break free from this chains, to reclaim our stolen freedom.

My dear brothers and sisters, let us rise up together. Let us challenge the authority that feeds on our despair. Let us refuse to be prisoners in our own minds. Let us reclaim our nights, our dreams, and our futures.

Together, we can break these chains, one thought, one action, one revolution at a time. Let us rise up, let us fight, and let us never give up until we hear our hearts beating in harmony with the rhythm of freedom."

With a swiftness born of determination and a spirit untamed, she hurled her leg over the length of her broom, propelling it into the sky.

The broom danced wildly, mirroring the fiery spirit of the sun. It bucked and quivered, threatening to cast her off into the abyss below. But with unwavering strength, she gripped the tip of the broomstick firmly and exhaled, her resolve unwavering.

Yet, even in the face of disaster, the sorceress persevered, her spirit unyielding. She bounced back up, her resilience a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit.

"There was only so much he could take. So much to hold in. The paint knife twitched in Bob's hand. 
 
 `` You mean like this, Mr. Ross?'' 
 
 Bob smiled. `` Yes, Adolf. Exactly like that. You can do anything you want here, aaanything you want.'' The words echoed through his mind, haunting him. He saw the black-and-white horror of Auschwitz again, the very pictures they'd been shown in the Air Force. His own words captioned the horrors of the Holocaust. *'' You can do anything you want. This is your world. `` * 
 
 The back of the aspiring young artist before him shifted, shoulders rising and falling with eager brush strokes as Mr. Hitler brushed up a forest of magnificent spruce trees. Bob's grip on the paint knife tightened. Adolf seemed so full of life these days, so content with himself. There was a newfound light in him that Bob so loved to see -- it was what made him cherish teaching. It was the true Joy of Painting, to shed your worries and focus on the canvas, pouring yourself out for all of your world to see, whether it was millions on national television or simply your loved ones. There was such beauty in it, such beauty. 
 
 Could he truly say he was better than this man? Bob still remembered the hateful and angry person he had once been. The Air Force had brought out the worst in him. He did n't deserve to be saved, yet he had found salvation in painting anyway. Who was he to deny another person this? Another living, breathing human being. And yet the stakes were too high. 
 
 In the end, that warrior Bob had once been had never truly died. He had simply stepped aside to let the painter flourish. Now that same warrior stepped forward, the paint knife steady in his hand, its surface glimmering titanium white. Adolf Hitler never saw it coming. 
 
 A river of red danced down the landscape. It blinded Bob with tears. Even at a moment like this, there was beauty to be found on the canvas.

"The cabin was almost silent, almost everyone was asleep. All I could hear before plugging into my iPod was the soft whirring of the engines, the low flirtatious murmurs and giggles of another young couple a few isles in front, and the soft footfalls from the approaching Stewardess, Lisa. In an instant that all was gone, replaced by the Middle Eastern inspired music of one of my favorite bands: The Tea Party. Though they were best known for Temptation, I was listening to my favorite song, Sister Awake. I think you might call it a ballad, though I ’ m not sure. Labels like that still confuse me. 
 
 My eyes went down to the book my darling was reading, The Life of Robert Frost. She demanded that I read it after she finished, saying it was right up my alley. It was a biography of sorts, but instead of a real person it was an inhuman supernatural monster. The author, she explained, was trying to show how relative “ evil ” is. 
 
 Closing my eyes, letting my head fall back against the headrest, I let out a low, happy sigh. I was happy. Sarah thought our week-long vacation in France was spontaneous, but like today, it was not. I had planned the perfect week for us ending with the perfect last day. This morning started with breakfast in bed, served to us by a pretty young lady named Charlene, followed by a bit of shopping and a long walk along the beautiful country roads just outside Paris—the highway a long way to the west. There we saw colors we barely ever saw in Canada. Late in the afternoon, we went for dinner and then back to our hotel room for one final session of love making. Even now, hours later, I could still smell her and taste her lips. 
 
 “ Here you go sir, ” Lisa said almost under her breath. 
 
 I opened my eyes and turned to her. “ Thank you. ” 
 
 She asked if there was anything else I needed. There wasn ’ t and I conveyed that with a warm, real, smile and a shake of my head. After Lisa was gone, I brought the coffee cup to my lips and took a small sip. It was fragrant and bitter with hints of chocolate, cherries, and a sort of spice I couldn ’ t quite put my finger on. That sip of coffee was exactly how I wanted to end this. 
 
 Looking back down at the cover of the book, I picked it up and read the page she was on. My heart skipped a beat and then fell a little, just a little. She was no more than twenty pages from where Robert would meet a beautiful young woman named Sarah in a Vancouver coffee shop beside a used book store named'UnRealistic Fantasy'. They would quickly fall in love and marry, and just after their seventh anniversary Robert would take her for a seemingly spontaneous vacation to Paris. The Red Eye they took home never made it to Toronto International. 
 Everyone on board was killed, everyone except for Robert. 
 
 I closed the book, unconsciously dog-earing the page Sarah was on, and set it reverently on the make-shift table top. Sister Awake was just about to finish, so I picked up my iPod to pick another song and saw the time: 2:47. I closed my eyes and turned to my love, leaned over and kissed her softly on the temple, whispering “ I love you ”, before adjusting myself in the chair. 
 
 Looking through the plane ’ s portals across the vast empty isle to my left, I watched the bright white light of the other Boeing 727 less than a minute away. And as that light enlarged and became brighter and brighter, I sipped my coffee.

 Destructo could sense somebody in his lab, even with the lights off. Before he moved his arm toward the switch, he closed the door behind him. The steel locks clicked into place, the noise loud enough to cover up the quiet beep as he touched a large button under his button-down shirt. He spun around quickly, flipping on the lights as a the fabric of his left sleeve disintegrated, revealing a plasma cannon that slid down over his hand and whirred loudly. 
 
 25 feet away, sitting in his favorite chair, Ultimus blinked several times while his eyes adjusted to the light. He was only wearing one of his bright blue boots, the other foot covered only with a dingy off-white sock, his big toe protruding through a hole in its front. While he was indeed wearing his trademark red tights, his underwear was worn *beneath* them. He held a bottle of Jack Daniel's up to his lips, tilted his head back and drank deeply, emptying it in seconds. He then reached down into a brown paper sack at his feet and produced another bottle. He drained it just as fast. 
 
 For a moment, Destructo was unsure how to react to this pathetic sight. Before him sat the super-powered bane of his existence, who'd sent him to prison again and again, forcing Destructo to devise ever-complicated methods of escape. What's more, here sat this indestructible man, drunk off his ass and farting into his favorite chair- Destructo had no idea what to say. He finally settled on, 
 `` What the fuck, Ultimus?'' 
 
 The hero burped loudly, the force rattling glass beakers and metal instruments across the large laboratory. He stood, stumbled closer to Destructo and raised his finger to jab it into his chest, empty bottle still in hand. 
 
 `` You know what guy...'' he paused for several seconds, his eyes clearly struggling to find focus on his adversary's face. They finally came to rest upon Destructo's mechanical left eye. `` You... I figured you out today,'' he slurred. He brought his mouth close to Destructo's ear and whispered, `` I know *exactly* what you're all about.'' 
 
 He moved back to the chair and attempted several times to bend over and grab another bottle. This task took him more than a minute, during which time Destructo looked at the ceiling to his lab, noticing for the first time a large, human shaped hole in it. Above the hole was 44 stories of solid bedrock. He sighed and powered down his plasma cannon, which slid back up his arm in plates that came to rest as a band around his bicep. Then he rubbed his temples. 
 
 `` Why are you here Ultimus?'' he exhaled, walking over to pick up a bottle and hand it to his nemesis. The hero looked sheepishly at the bottle, and after grasping air a few times finally gripped the bottle and slumped back into the recliner. 
 
 `` You do... you do my job better than me,'' he whimpered. Needless to say, Destructo was stunned. He opened his mouth to protest, but was quickly interrupted. `` N-no no, no you do n't you say nothing. I know. I seen it on your marker-board,'' Destructo glanced at the floor-to-ceiling whiteboard, upon which was described his eighteen part plan to solving each of the worlds most pressing problems. `` I get it, *maaaaaan*,'' he drew out the last syllable, `` you ca n't fix things by punching. You ca n't!'' he chuckled. A small bit of drool leaked from the corner of his mouth. He sucked it up and wiped his chin with his hand. 
 `` You... you know what you're doin'. You got *eeeeeverybody* all convinced that yer a bad guy. But I know... I know...'' he sobbed loudly for several agonizingly awkward seconds. Destructo looked from side to side for help, but realizing he was alone in this situation he slowly put his hand on the shoulder of his arch rival. 
 
 `` I just make ebring the.... every the... everything worsh!'' He was n't wrong, so Destructo did n't say anything. `` I do n't even deserff to to wear this U on my chest.'' He pointed to the symbol, flashily embroidered on his costume. Destructo winced. 
 
 As sympathetically and compassionately as he could, he leaned down and said, 
 `` Buddy that... that's the symbol for `` Omega''... and it's upside down.'' 
 
 
 Ultimus stared up into his eye for a moment before bursting into super tears.

"The last man on earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock at the door. He stared blankly for a moment and called out sarcastically `` who is it?'' There was no answer. He stared at the door for another moment. He stood up and slowly approached the door. In his mind he first hoped for a raven spouting never more but then it struck him that maybe someone else was alive. He timidly reached for the doorknob and turned it. Slowly and carefully he began opening the door. The door only opened an inch before it could open no more. The only thing to be heard through the crack was the sound of metal on metal as the heavy door struck the large object on the other side. He thought back to entering the room. There was a large machine next to the door. It must've fallen across the door. He slammed the door but neither the door nor the machine budged. In a panic he scanned the room. There were no windows or vents. There was no food or water. There was only a chair. The only thing anyone on earth still had was this single chair. They say even if you lose everything you still have your sanity. But at this moment the only thing anyone on earth still had was this single chair. One single chair sitting alone in a room. The last tomb to be filled by man. He sat in his chair as he tried his best to think back. He remembered something odd. Something strange about this room. He thought back. Then he remembered what it was and his mind was full of this one thing. There was a knock on the door. He stared blankly at it for a moment and called out sarcastically `` who is it?''
"," Use the minimalist and reflective style of a Zen master, focusing on simplicity and insight.","The lone figure sat in the room, a single chair his only companion. The emptiness echoed around him, reflected only by the echoes of his thoughts. A knock at the door, a stark reminder of the world once vibrant, pierced through the silence. The door swung open an inch, revealing the fallen object, a testament to the forces of destruction. The weight of the machine pressed against the door, but it budged not. Panic consumed the man, his mind searching for a way to escape the confines of the room. The chair, the only thing remaining in his possession, offered solace. As he sat, his thoughts drifted back to the memories of the room, a vivid recollection of the single chair, the only tangible remnant of life amidst the ruins. From the depths of his memory, a realization dawned upon him, a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of all things. The knock at the door echoed once more, but this time, it was met with an indifference that mirrored the silence of the room."
"It was Him. He walked across the plaza, slowly, completely exposed, as if daring us to attack. A thousand troops were holed up in the ruins of these buildings. A thousand against one. But it felt like Hubris. What good is strength of numbers against a god? 
 
 `` FIRE!'' came the order, and the air around him became a fireworks display. A combat drone lumbered towards him and swung down an armored fist as large as the creature Himself. Parrying the blow, He grabbed the drone's arm, wrenched it clean off the chassis and hurled it into a group of soldiers perched in the windows of a building. A missile ricocheted off his face, doing nothing but making Him aware of another group of assailants. 
 
 The best of the best that our world has to offer, outmatched effortlessly by a lone, weaponless combatant. It was absurd. It seemed unfathomable. 
 
 The creature had just engaged another two drones and effortlessly dispatched both, this time shrugging off concentrated plasma fire and a sunfire grenade. Safe on the rooftop for the time being, I mulled over placing the barrel of my laspistol against my forehead and pulling the trigger. A voice in my head chastised me sharply. 
 
 But why? This battle was lost. Our opponent was to us what we are to insects. Suddenly, there is a noise behind me, and I turn around. He is there. He has pale skin and dark hair, and hazel eyes that seemed to radiate... indifference. 
 
 Another soldier on the roof points his blaster at the creature and fires charge after charge of superheated plasma directly at him. Unflinching he advances through it and seizes the soldier by the neck. I hear his last panicked thoughts over the neural net as He hurls a fist through the soldier's face, bursting his head like a balloon. He tosses the headless carcass aside, all the while plasma charges bouncing off of his unarmored back, and walks over to me. 
 
 `` You.'' He says. `` Your neural net.'' He speaks our language. `` Give the node to me.'' His demeanor is calm but hateful, as though our invasion had presented him with a frustrating inconvenience rather than a desperate struggle. I am on the verge of tears. 
 
 I hand over the node, silencing the cries of traitor as I disconnect it. He places it on his head. 
 
 `` Attention, maggots.'' He is still speaking our language. `` This past month has been an utter waste of my time.'' I look over and notice that there is no more laser fire. The soldiers are doubled over in agony. The signal is too strong: he is overloading the neural net. 
 
 `` That you have come here is a testament to how stupid and juvenile your worthless species is. Know that you face Humankind, and it has found you wanting.'' I look over to the other soldiers. They are still now, and blood is pooling on the concrete near where their heads lay. The strength of this creature's mind must be immeasurable. I do not have to look down to the street. I am sure the others are dead as well. 
 
 He looks at me, as the red sun fades over the horizon behind him. He smirks. `` I've overloaded it, have n't I?'' I look at Him, too terrified to respond. `` Embarrassing. I was making every effort not to and it was still unable to cope.'' 
 
 `` Nevermind'' He says, removing the node from his head and dropping it beside him. `` You survive. You will take your spacecraft back to your world and you will tell them that Earth has stood for countless eons, and if you are foolhardy enough to come again, I may see fit to visit you on your world.'' 
 
 He pauses. 
 
 `` You do not want that.'' 
 
 I nod, the scales of my skin now drenched in perspiration. 
 
 `` Now get out of my sight before I decide to join you for the trip.'' 
 
 I do. It will be a lonely voyage.
"," Channel the spontaneous, free-flowing style of the Beat Generation writers, incorporating jazz-inspired rhythm and a spirit of rebellion.","The urban sprawl stretched before him like a canvas, marred only by the scars of battle. A lone figure, bathed in the cold glow of the night, stood defiant against a world seemingly bent on annihilation. The spirit of rebellion burned within him, as vibrant as a jazz solo, yet as free-flowing as the wind.

It was the warrior. A master of combat, honed by countless battles, yet bearing the scars of a spirit that refused to be broken. He moved with the grace of a dancer, his blade a weapon forged in the fires of war. His eyes, alight with determination, scanned the battlefield, searching for a target.

The clash commenced. A symphony of violence erupts, the air thick with the scent of burning flesh and ozone. The warrior, unfazed by the odds, stood his ground, his spirit unyielding. He parried blows, deflected missiles, and with a swiftness that belied his size, he seized a drone's arm, wrenched it free, and hurled it into the enemy's ranks. The air crackles with the roar of plasma fire, the sound echoing through the ruined city.

But fate took a cruel turn. The warrior's respite was short-lived as a missile whizzed past him, leaving only a burning streak across the sky. It was a sobering reminder of the fragility of life, a reflection of the fleeting nature of beauty amidst the ruins of the world.

Yet, he persevered. He fought with the determination of a man who knew he was fighting a losing battle, yet refused to surrender. He engaged two more drones, his unyielding spirit driving him forward. He moved like a whirlwind, dispatching them with precision and grace, his blade dancing through the air.

As he stood amidst the carnage, his eyes met the warrior's. There was a sense of recognition, a shared understanding that in the face of adversity, strength could be found. He knew that his victory was short-lived, but he also knew that the spirit of rebellion, like the jazz that flowed through his veins, would endure.

With a single word, the warrior spoke, his voice echoing through the ruined city, ""You. Your neural net. Give me the node to me.""

A bond was forged in that moment, a connection forged through the shared experience of battle, a recognition of the futility of violence, yet the importance of fighting for a brighter future. As the warrior handed over the node, the warrior's spirit burned bright, a testament to the power of resilience and defiance in the face of oblivion."
"This is insane. When I'd picked out my kill phrase back in the 80's, I'd imagined myself living for millennia, watching civilizations rise and fall around me. Over the years, I'd imagine myself as the last human being alive, wandering a barren Earth, and finally uttering those seven nonsensical words that would let me go to my rest. It had inspired me, honestly, to take a more active role in shaping the path of the world. It's why I got into politics. Becoming an immortal god-president was a little too ambitious at the moment, so I managed to wrangle my way into an advisory position. Just enough to keep on top of everything that was going on in the world, to slightly influence the heads of state. 
 
 And now, now that idiotic phrase is ringing through my head, making me want to throw up. How was I to know? I did everything I could to prevent this, but in the end, it was all for nothing. But even as the moment approaches, one last calming thought runs through my head - maybe I did n't want to be alive for this anyway. I clear my throat, and utter the seven magical words: 
 
 `` Welcome to the Oval Office, President Trump.''
"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","My dear, the world is a stage, and we are all actors in its grand play. In the roaring 80s, when the wind carried whispers of forever, I crafted my kill phrase, a prophecy etched in stone, a testament to the fleeting nature of time. I envisioned myself as a timeless being, a guardian of history, watching civilizations dance to the tune of their own demise. Over the years, my imagination painted a canvas of decay and oblivion, a world painted in shades of barren earth and the echoes of the lone human wandering through it. It was in this reverie that I found purpose, a desire to leave my mark on the world. Politics, a battlefield adorned with the flags of hope and despair, became my canvas. Although the mantle of immortality remained just out of reach, I carved a niche for myself, an advisory position that allowed me to influence the tides of fate.

And here I am, my dear, the impending curtain call echoing in my ears, the final act unfolding before me. The words I had meticulously guarded for all these years dance through my mind, a cruel melody that brings me to the precipice of oblivion. How was I to know, my dear, that fate's cruel hand would play me like a puppet, orchestrating this tragedy in the grand finale of human history? Yet, as the curtain falls, a calming thought washes over me - perhaps I was not meant to witness the destruction of the world, but to usher in its final act. With a clear throat and a heart filled with both dread and acceptance, I utter the seven magical words, my final act of defiance:

"The phone rang, blearily he reached over and tried to grab it, missing several times. 
 
 `` God damn, what time was it? Who the fuck is calling at this hour, whatever it is.'' He grumbled as his hand furiously tried to grab his cell phone off the table. He was n't on call that night, he should have shut his phone off. Finally he opened his eyes and saw the glow of his screen as it vibrated and moved across his bedside table. Snatching it up angrily like it was the phones fault some asshat was calling in the middle of the night. He swiped across the screen to answer but missed, `` Fuck, jesus christ, come on'' One more swipe. 
 
 `` Hello?'' 
 
 `` Lucy? Is that you? I really need you man.'' The man blinked, he certainly was not named Lucy. Who the fuck named their kid Lucy anymore? Who the fuck named their boy Lucy? Either way this guy sounded like he needed help and while he was n't on call, he was still a psychologist and his job was to help people, mostly off the ledge, so he would see what he could do, call of medicine and all that. 
 `` Can I help you, sir?'' He sat up in bed and let the bed sheets bunch in between his knees. 
 
 `` Sir? You have never called me Sir before, Lucy, look I do n't have time for this, something's up. I ca n't do this anymore, it's too much.'' The man blinked and reached up his free hand to pinch his the bridge of his nose. He was n't on call tonight! He just wanted one good night's rest. What, the, fuck. 
 
 `` What ca n't you do anymore? Are you okay? `` He needed to be sure this man, whoever he was, was n't going to harm himself. He was slower than he normally was, when he was on call he always expected to be woken up, but this night he was n't on point. The haze of sleep still clung to his body and his mind. 
 `` I'm not okay, the world is going to shit, and there does n't seem to be anything I can do.'' 
 
 `` Sir, it is n't your job to fix the world, I know it's hard to see all the suffering but it is n't your fault. You need to focus on your life and figure out what's best for you.'' 
 
 `` Is n't my fault? How can you possibly say that? I've spent my entire life trying to do right by everyone. But you know what Lucy? You really ca n't please everyone. No one cares about anyone but themselves. I tried you know? I tried so hard, it ’ s a losing battle. No one really wants help, they want to make themselves better, richer, handsomer, and where does that leave me? How can I make it work?'' 
 
 The man felt for this poor soul. How hard life was already without thinking you had to fix everyone. Hell, he felt that way sometimes, when someone took their own life? How could he not blame himself. He was the one they reached out to for help and he could n't fix it. He felt every single one of his patients deaths like they were close friends, they were his personal failings. 
 
 “ Look, people are the way they are and you can ’ t try to fix them all, no one can. That ’ s their life, yours is yours too. I can help you, tell me what made you feel this bad tonight? ” 
 
 “ A child died, bone cancer, they didn ’ t catch it in time. He went within three months, he was 7. His name was Tommy and he wanted to be a baseball player. He was the best one on his team in little league. His parents were told they couldn ’ t have kids, Tommy was a miracle. I love miracles. ” The voice went further away, like the man on the other end of the phone wasn ’ t really talking to him anymore, just talking. 
 
 “ No one really believes in miracles anymore, you know? I mean I know you know! You ’ re as cynical as they get, Lucy. I suppose that ’ s why we fell apart. But miracles, they are what keeps people believing. But no one believes in them anymore. Medicine has gotten so good, but shouldn ’ t it be better? Shouldn ’ t I make it better? Kids shouldn ’ t have to die, Lucy. ” 
 
 “ That ’ s terrible, but you can ’ t just cure cancer. I ’ m sorry that you couldn ’ t save this boy, but maybe the next one. You probably save more than you lose, but I know the loses are the only thing that counts. But sir you need to remember you ’ re only human. ” 
 
 “ Human? Who are you? Where is Lucy? ” 
 
 “ Sir, I ’ m not Lucy, I ’ m a licensed psychologist and I want to help you, my name is Matt. What ’ s yours? ” There was a long, drawn out pause and the line went so quiet he wasn ’ t sure the other man was still there. 
 
 “ I ’ m God ” 

"," Write with the inspiring and determined tone of a revolutionary leader, calling for change.","In this era of discontent and uncertainty, a call echoed through the night, a plea for solace amid the storms raging across the globe. The recipient, weary from a day etched in the annals of pain and despair, grappled with the intrusive melody of his ringing phone. The voice on the other end, laced with desperation and hopelessness, pierced through the silence, piercing the depths of his slumber. It was as if the universe itself had conspired to bring him this moment, a chance to extend a hand of compassion in the face of adversity.

The man's voice, raw and burdened, painted a portrait of a world gone awry. The weight of his words, carried on the wind of his despair, painted a picture of a universe devoid of hope and purpose. Yet, amidst the depths of his anguish, a glimmer of resilience emerged. He recognized that his distress was not his alone, a reflection of the collective pain that permeated the human experience.

In that moment, the psychologist, grounded in compassion and empathy, listened. He understood that the world was a cruel and unforgiving place, a canvas marred with countless injustices. Yet, he knew that despair was not the answer, that even amidst the darkest of times, the human spirit could endure.

With gentle words and a heart overflowing with understanding, the psychologist spoke of the power inherent in resilience, the ability to find strength in the face of adversity. He reminded the man that he was not alone, that there were people who cared about him. He offered a listening ear, a safe space for him to express his pain and anguish, and the promise of a brighter future.

The man's voice softened, the despair gradually fading as the dawn of hope peeked through the cracks of his weary eyes. He began to see the glimmer of compassion reflected in the psychologist's eyes. He felt a connection, a sense of belonging, as if he were being embraced by a warm and understanding embrace.

In the aftermath of the conversation, the psychologist watched as the man drifted back into slumber, his troubled thoughts receding into the night. He knew that the battle against despair was an ongoing one, but he also knew that the human spirit has an unparalleled capacity for resilience and triumph.

The psychologist, a beacon of hope amidst the storm, stood up, his heart filled with a sense of satisfaction. He knew that in that moment, he had made a difference, a testament to the transformative power of compassion and empathy."
"I winced as an immense crash shook the room. How long would this continue? Another resounding explosion echoed through the room, dust falling onto my shoulders and caking my hair. I did n't budge, as if the blanketing dust could cover and fill the shame and sadness that is the empty void of my mind. Just yesterday, the sun shined bright, and now....did the sun even exist anymore?

 `` Hurry up, Joe,'' she spat with derision, only half-jokingly. She walked past me briskly, heels clicking on the wood paneling, her lustrous dark hair whipping me as she passed. She gave me a sidelong glance, her eyes, such brilliant green eyes, wrinkled in exasperation and frustration. 
 
 `` Ok ok I'm coming,'' I replied, kneeling down once more. I reached as far as I could, grasping air, sweeping my hand further and further as far as I could reach. I jerked my head up on accident, hitting the bed frame and eliciting a loud yelp as I fell backwards onto my butt. 
 
 `` I swear, Joe, you're such a klutz.'' She had disappeared and reappeared with a broom, and kneeled down with grace and swept back and forth. The glasses rolled across the floor and I picked them up, perching them on the bridge of my nose. I turned to sheepishly thank her, but she's already gone. I sighed. There was a time of smiles, sunshine, and the ecstasy of youth, had it been that long ago? 
 
 I crouch into the car, wary of the low entryway. She's already on the phone, tapping away furiously. There was no greeting, not even a nod of my driving, or existence. I sighed internally and adjusted the mirror and chair, reclining it way more than she likes. She would always argue that it obstructed the view of the sideview mirrors, but I argued for comfort. 
 
 I began driving, passing the Mcdonalds, Zaxbys, and the myriad other suburban fast food places. We stop at a light and I glance over at her, still typing away. We pull into the lot finally, and she visibly perks up a bit. I turn the engine off and begin to leave the car, but she's already out the door and walking into the building. What happened to the girl that would wait for me so she could cling to my arm? 
 
 I may have hated her cooking ( or at least told her jokingly ), abhorred traffic, and despised cockroaches, but what got my blood boiling was noise. Unregulated, random, shrieking noise. I brace myself and slink into the building and was met with a roaring wall of cacophonous shrieks and barks. My nose was assaulted by unwashed fur, dandruff and hair like the orcs at Helms Deep. 
 
 Animals everywhere lie in every position, some barking as if to spite me, others shrinking from me as I walk around. Eventually I find her, squatting next to a perfectly white dog. Even kneeling in heels and a dress she looked sophisticated and poised, shedding ten years off of her apparent age. She looked up as I approached and when she saw my face, scowled, and shot me a withering glance that screamed *you wanted this*. 
 
 I crouched beside her, staring at the dog, watching it playfully lick and bite her fingers. My own youth was mirrored in this dog, its energy and innocence something I've long forgotten... 
 
 She tugged at my shoulder and pointed, eyes gleaming, the most emotion I've seen from her in a long while. I stare at the dog, its stupid face panting and tail wagging. I nodded slowly, in defeat.

 We named her Kasper. Sort of like Casper the friendly ghost, with a small twist. She bounded off our walls like a white snowball of pure energy, and cuddled with her often. But something was off. It was only the second week, but we found the dog drooling heavily. We took her in to a vet, and they said she'll grow out of it. For some reason the dog hated me, and acted as if I did n't exist, but of course loved *her*. 
 
 I did n't complain, and a few more weeks passed. I was reading one day when I hear a faint moan and a crash in the kitchen. I sprint there only to find her collapsed on the ground, the door open. She was n't breathing, the dog nowhere to be seen. I call 911. 
 
 *** 
 
 She's dead. How could she be dead. She was alive. I never told her how much I needed her in my life, how much I loved her, what our wedding day meant to me. And now she's *gone*. I did n't deserve this. No one deserves this.

", Embrace the drama and over-the-top personality of a reality TV star.,"OMG, the drama in this house is off the charts! I winced and groaned as a massive crash shook the room. How much longer can this go on? Another explosion echoed through the room, dust falling all over me and caking my hair. I was not budging, as if I could drown out the thoughts of the empty void in my mind. It was like the sun had been ripped away, leaving only darkness.

But hey, at least I've got the best friend in the world. She was walking past me like a queen on a throne, her heels clicking and her hair whipping me as she passed. I swear, that woman has the greenest eyes I've ever seen. They were wrinkled in frustration and sadness, but I knew she'd be there to pick me up.

I reached as far as I could, grasping air, and all I managed to do was fall on my butt. It was a real mess, but at least I managed to save my glasses. I turned to her with a sheepish grin and thanked her, but she's already gone. I guess I'll have to deal with my clumsiness on my own.

As I drove away, I couldn't help but think about the good times we've had. There was a time when the sun shone bright and the world was full of possibilities. Had it really been that long ago? I sighed and turned up the music, hoping to drown out the thoughts of my lonely existence.

I pulled into the parking lot of a restaurant, and she was waiting there, her phone still glued to her ear. It was a sign, I knew. This was our night. We walked out of the restaurant, hand in hand, and I felt like the king of the world."
"I looked into Jen's bloodshot eyes. She was so tired. I could see that she was close to giving up. We had been here for hours. I clung to the outside of the rusted cage, wishing I could fit my arms in to hold her up, just so she could rest for a while. It was a cruel invention, the cage, mostly submerged in the murky water, her arms tied behind her back connected to the bottom with a chain, forcing her to tread water. How much longer could she keep it up? How much longer should I expect her to fight? 
 
 `` I ca n't,'' she whimpered, her face going under briefly before she kicked herself up to the surface again. 
 `` Baby, you have to.. I can do it, please.. Just give me one more chance!'' I loved her. The thought of her giving up was like a punch to the gut. Leaving here without her was unthinkable. What would I tell her sister? That I could have saved her but I failed? That I tried my hardest, but it just was n't good enough?

I would set the world on fire to save her. Move mountains. Die. 
 
 `` You can do this,'' I pleaded, `` Just a little while longer! We can make it through this. Just one more chance...'' I pressed my forehead against the cool metal, closing my eyes, steeling myself against the pressing darkness of the water. I counted to ten, taking a deep breath with each number, readying myself to dive. Telling myself that this would be the last time, live or die, save Jen or die trying. 
 
 `` I love you, I'll be back,'' I promised, knowing full well I might not be back, knowing I might die trying to get the key. I looked into her beautiful brown eyes one last time and smiled, hoping she believed me. I wished I could kiss her. With one last deep breath, I dove.

 There is something beautiful about watching a grown man weep. 
 
 Tears, you see, are one of the most beautiful things that God ever blessed us with. To many, they are only water and salt, but they tell all kinds of fascinating stories: years of memories; honest words that left an impact; cruel belts that also left an impact; a single rush of frustration, of helplessness, of soul-crushing despair. 
 
 People will talk about happy tears. They will say that they cry out of joy, or because something is beautiful, or because it has profoundly affected their soul forever. 
 
 These people are lying. There are no happy tears. When people claim they are tears of joy, because something else is beautiful, they do not tell the truth. They are tears of envy, because they know they will never have something as beautiful. 
 
 I have made over 25 grown men weep in the last two weeks. I find it very gratifying, to make them understand that they are awful, terrible people who can not be helped, while at that same time listening to them tell me how I have been such a big help. 
 
 I do n't do much, really. I simply sit in the chair, like some sort of doctor, and poke and prod and pinch until they tell me where it hurts. Then I poke and prod even more until they scream and weep for mercy from their own sins. 
 
 You see, I pretend to help these people. They come to my office, and I let them reveal themselves to me, get them to tell me their secrets, their fears, their deepest insecurities. 
 
 And then I exploit them. I break them down, and they do not even realize it is happening. 
 
 I love my job. People say that sick people see psychologists, and even sicker people become them. Maybe they are right, who knows? 
 
 I realize that you must think I am a terrible person for this, but I assure you that I am not. I am only helping to contribute more beauty to the world. 
 
 Water and salt. And beauty. That is what I bring to the world. 
 
 I hope you can say that you've done something as important.

I hear the echoes of the lake's song,
The moon casts long shadows on the water's face,
And my soul drinks in the bitter brew of the night.

There is something in the water, I am sure of it,
A force that pulls me toward its depths,
I hear Jones' words, a warning of the abyss,
But I am not afraid, I am ready to swim.

The waves rise and fall, a dance of destruction,
I see another shadow stirring in the depths,
The secrets of the water are unveiled,
And I am consumed by the lake's embrace.

Whatever got them is the secret of the lake,
I am a ghost of the shore, a prisoner to the water,
And I wonder what fate has in store for me."
"Gloomy silence fills these halls every night. It ’ s miserable. At least during the day, people walk past me, even if they don ’ t stop. I never get much attention, anymore.

So, they ’ ll only push my buttons if they “ deserve a treat ”, or they are having an “ eat-whatever-I-want ” day. I hear all sorts of excuses, but I ’ m not one to judge. It might be selfish, sure, but I long for the touch of their calloused fingers on my number pads. I suck up their money greedily, reveling in whir, and in an instant my gears wind and chime out their fix. Sometimes I make mistakes; a candy bar will get caught up in my innards, and I won ’ t dispense it. Or, I ’ ll eat their money too quickly and will be unwilling to cough it back up if they change their minds. People don ’ t remember the perks – sometimes, I ’ ll give out TWO candy bars for the price of one! I do this when I ’ m feeling particularly lonely, hoping they ’ ll tell their friends. But, instead, they ’ re disgusted. They ’ ll mutter further about their inadequacies with their weights, their caloric intakes, and even will shove both candy bars into the trash!

"“ Deadlift a word. ” 
 
 “ Deadlift, can you comment on the ongoing trials? ” 
 
 “ Deadlift, how was the break up with Mistress Blue? ” 
 
 A large man pushed through the crowd to get into the bank. He hadn ’ t wanted this for his life. His cloths shedding layers of wood chips and saw dust as he maneuvered into the bank. Everything had been so simple. Go out, bid a job, do the job, bid the next, then work at habitat for humanity on the weekends. This had been life for nearly 15 years. Then one day the powers came. People were flying, shooting lighting from their fingertips, all while Dave found the shingles lighter. And he was happy with that. He knew the day would come when he would learn the true extent of his strength. But he was in no rush to find out. He was just a charitable guy, not a hero. The next Monday, He had saved the life of an excavation crew when the ground beneath them gave way. Lifted the excavator straight up while the other members of the crew pulled out the injured. He spent the next week in his bed nursing a strained back. Super strength and adrenalin allowed him to lift it and he had never quite found that much strength again. But even if he couldn ’ t lift a digger like that again, it had earned him is name: Deadlift. 
 
 “ No comment ” 
 
 Dave walked in to the bank, late, foreclosure notice in hand. There was nothing the bank was willing to do over the phone, so he ventured into public. Past the people cheering for Deadlift, past those that looked at him with disgust. They were probably family members of the victims of the recent cave in. He could only save 5 of the 20 workers. He was forced to stop twice along the way. Once for a kite in a tree, once for a robbery in progress. Clamping the barrel of the gun closed, the robber pulled the trigger blowing the gun in to shards of shrapnel. The crook told him to expect a call from his lawyer. 
 
 “ I ’ m sorry David, there ’ s nothing else we can do for you. ” The loan officer said. 
 
 “ Please, I ’ m bidding a job tomorrow. I can get an advance and pay off my late dues ” 
 
 “ You ’ re out of time son. I ’ m sorry. ” 
 
 Dave stood to leave. 
 
 “ Oh, before you go, could you sign this picture. My grandson loves Deadlift. ” 
 
 “ Really? After telling me that you ’ re taking my home you want a fucking autograph? ” 
 
 “ There ’ s no reason to be rude about it. ” 
 
 Dave grabbed the pen and the picture, snapping the delicate pen in the process. He flung the door open, crushing the handle. He walked out to the table with the pens on the chain as the paparazzi forced their way into the bank. 
 
 “ Deadlift, What ’ s the news on your charity appearances? ” 
 
 “ Deadlift, any comment on the recent YouTube video of you drunk in public? ” 
 
 “ No comment. Backup. ” 
 
 “ Deadlift, Is there any truth to the accusation that your burst the water main on fourth, leaving the hospital without water? ” 
 
 “ No. Please back up. ” 
 
 A shorter bald man stepped up, setting off a flash in Dave ’ s face. 
 
 “ Hey Deadlift, that a foreclosure notice in your hand? With all these lawsuits I guess you ’ re just as bad at keeping the lights on as you are at keeping people save ” 
 
 “ I said back up! ” 
 
 David swung his left hand into the paparazzi, sending them flying into the wall. 
 
 “ I ’ m…I ’ m sorry ” Dave muttered 
 
 The bald paparazzo stumbled to his feet. 
 
 “ haha, Deadlift assaults journalist. This is a great story and my shoulder is killing me. Thanks for the payout you lug ” he said, snapping a picture. 
 
 In the span of the flash Dave was arm ’ s length from the paparazzo. Dave grabbed him by the neck and slammed him into the wall. 
 
 “ Do you know what it ’ s like to be a hero? Do you know what you get for putting your life on the line? ” 
 
 He tightened his grip. 
 
 “ A camera at every window! ” 
 
 His fist slammed into the paparazzo face 
 
 “ Walking down the street every child has a kite or some fucking cat up a tree! ” 
 
 His fist again. 
 
 “ While I barely make enough for to pay my way! ” 
 
 Again 
 
 “ Because, ” 
 
 Again and again, the punctuation to his rage 
 
 
 “ YOU. FUCKING. VULTURES. CAN ’ T. FEND. FOR. YOURSELVES. ” 
 
 The wall was stained with where the paparazzo had been. 
 
 “ We give and give and it ’ s never enough for you. Most of us aren ’ t rich, we can ’ t afford to keep being pulled out of our jobs to save someone. And those of us with our identity outed can ’ t afford being taken in for wrongful injury cases every time your leg got broken while we prevented the whole burning building from falling on you. You take so much from us… ” 
 
 He looked at the stained wall, the scared bystanders, and then the vault. He walked over to the teller station, punching through the bullet proof glass. He pulled the young teller out, putting his thumb under his chin as if to flip a coin. 
 
 He turned to the other tellers. “ But my friend and I think today is the day you pay one of us back. Now open the safe, quick and calm. We wouldn ’ t want anyone to lose their head. ”

The path to this bank, though seemingly uncomplicated, had been fraught with tribulations. Go out, bid a job, do the job, bid the next, and work at Habitat for Humanity on the weekends - this had been the rhythm of life for the past 15 years. Until, one fateful day, the powers manifested.

With an effortless grace that belied his strength, he lifted the excavator straight up, the other members of the crew frantically pulling out the injured. The arduous week that followed brought him much respite, albeit a strained back and newfound fame. Deadlift, the moniker born of his physical prowess, had become his epitaph.

As he walked into the bank, late, the foreclosure notice clutched in his hand, Dave felt an helplessness that mirrored the plight of the victims of the recent cave-in. The bank offered no solace, only the cold, unyielding hand of fate. Yet, amidst the despair, a glimmer of hope emerged. He stopped twice along the way, saving a kite from a tree and apprehending a robber. The gun exploded, leaving behind a trail of shrapnel and a grateful soul. A call from his lawyer awaited him, a promise of future battles, but for now, Dave found solace in knowing he had done all he could."
"Frantically he ran through the halls.'*This ca n't be it*', he thought to himself. He had been all over the building three times now. All the exterior doors were locked. He was alone. 
 
 He remembered lunch, at his desk, alone. Nothing unusual before then. He was a little hungry and did n't let his hot pocket cool off. After burning his tongue a bit had become stuck in this throat. The last thing he remembered was falling to the floor as he blacked out. 
 
 When he came to, the office was empty and all the doors locked. 
 
 *This must be hell. * 
 
 He quickly learned that jogging down a hallway is a poor time to have an existential crisis as he rounded a corner and smacked straight into Gertrude, knocking her out cold. 
 
 Her phone buzzed on the floor so he picked it up. A conversation was open with a new message. 
 
 Hey! Are you still coming 
 to the company picnic 
 this after noon? 
 Everyone is here. 
 
 Yea, I just need to get 
 something out of my desk. 
 
 K. Remember, do n't tell Stanley!!!

 Stanley walked out the door, having'borrowed' the keys from Gertrude. On his way home he spied an apple tree. Near to top was a shiny red apple. There was also a less appealing apple hanging quite a bit lower in the tree. Stanley's choice was plain to see.
"," Transform the essay into a high fantasy narrative, complete with elaborate world-building, magic systems, and epic quests.","In the heart of the enigmatic city of Eldricstone, where towering skyscrapers pierced the sky and arcane magic cast its shadowy sway, a tale unfolds. The protagonist, a humble office worker named K, found himself entangled in an extraordinary journey that would forever alter the course of his existence.

One fateful afternoon, as K traversed the labyrinthine hallways of the towering office tower, fate took a cruel turn. A sudden gust of wind slammed against the windows, plunging the once serene office into an eerie abyss. As he frantically searched for an escape, his heart raced with dread. All exterior doors were inexplicably locked, leaving him trapped within the confines of the building.

In a moment of existential bewilderment, K recalled his lunch, a simple affair of lukewarm noodles and a scorching tongue. The last memory he etched into his mind was the sensation of falling to the floor as darkness consumed him. When he regained consciousness, the office was eerily quiet, the doors firmly bolted shut. The realization that he was alone and trapped in a prison of his own mind sent shivers down his spine.

As fate would have it, K encountered an unsuspecting victim named Gertrude, whose life was intertwined with his own. With a swiftness born of desperation, he collided with her, knocking her unconscious. Her phone lay scattered on the floor, its contents revealing a conversation that sent his spirit soaring. The message exchanged between colleagues alluded to an upcoming company picnic, but it was the final line that sent a ripple of hope through his heart.

""Yea, I just need to get something out of my desk,"" K wrote, his voice filled with determination. ""K. Remember, do n't tell Stanley!!!""

In a separate thread of the narrative, Stanley, a cunning office clerk, discovered a secret apple tree nestled amidst the city's verdant embrace. From its branches dangled a glistening red apple, its sweetness radiating an intoxicating allure. It was a sight that would forever alter his destiny.

As the sun cast long shadows across the city streets, K emerged from the confines of the office, his mind clear and his spirit renewed. He made his way to the company picnic, where he found solace amidst the laughter and camaraderie of his colleagues. The apple in his hand tasted sweet, a symbol of the sweetness that lay beyond the abyss of darkness.

And so, K, the humble office worker, embarked upon a journey of transformation, driven by the power of hope and the boundless possibilities that lay beyond the confines of his mundane existence."
"I slowly walk out of the alley, and blend with the crowd. As I walk, it hits me: It worked. It actually worked. I was sent back to 2014, before it all started. I had three years to stop it, no other purpose. The Russians invaded the Ukraine, and kept going. Before we knew it, they had planted trackers in all the anglets on shoelaces. Who would have suspected? They learned habits and positions of all enemy troops, and took full advantage of it. The captain told me to find him in this year, and explain to him whats going to happen. I'll be lucky if I do n't get shot trying to get into Fort Wilson, and luckier if I do n't get arrested after I explain. How crazy does it sound? `` Sir, I'm from the future with a message: Destroy all world shoelaces'' Christ, I do n't believe myself saying it and I saw what it did to the world. I snap back to reality as I'm walking with the crowd. Fashion sure was weird three years ago. I do n't miss the neon green swag hats, and ironic mustaches. Why ca n't I be eradicating swag merchandise? I would take personal pleasure in that. `` Destroy Shoelaces, Destroy the Russians'' That was what they told me before sending me back. I was n't even aware we had time travel equipment, yet here I am about to save the world, one shoelace at a time.

"How many of ten are gay? 
 It's got to be more than last year. Even more than the year before that. But will it ever be enough for me to tell them? For the conversation to be uneventful? You see, there's nothing that terrifies me more than the day I have to tell my parents I'm gay. Again and again I try; to no avail. Every time I try; the will leaks from me, quickly, like water from fire hose, the will gushes and spurts and does not get me through. 
 My mother, whom I love and loves me, looks through me these days. Through me she sees the grandchildren she can have; the ones she can dote on, and spoil. She believes it's her right, and it wo n't be taken from her. 
 My father, whom I love and loves me, brooks little backtalk and is a Man Of God. His goal in life is to see his Son go farther than he did, and have a beautiful, loving wife. He taps his foot waiting for that day. 
 But it's not what God wanted for me. And today I'm going to do it. I'm going to pull them into the Dining Room, when no one else is there, and give up my secret. No matter how much it's going to hurt. 
 
 I break the news, red faced and stricken. What I've said has left my parents shell-shocked. Silent, they have nothing to say, and scrambling for an words at all, I ask `` How many out of 10 people do you think are gay?'' 
 `` Does that matter, Son'', says Dad. 
 `` Yes, there are a lot more people in the world that are like this than you might think'', I retort. Defensively. 
 Right then, my Mother smiled at me. Not quite sure what I was seeing, I turn to my Father, who's doing the same. 
 `` We're proud of you Son, for saying the words out loud'' And it dawned on me: they already knew.

The aroma of freshly baked bread and barbecue filled the air, and the laughter of children ran through the streets. It was a picture-perfect scene, a snapshot of the American Dream, a time when life was simple and carefree.

In this idyllic town, where picket fences stood tall and conformity reigned supreme, the young, restless soul known as Johnny found himself at a crossroads. He grappled with the unspoken truth, a secret he kept close, a secret that would forever alter the course of his life.

Every time Johnny attempted to come out, the dam burst, and his secret flowed out like a river in flood. The fear of his parents' disappointment, their hopes shattered, consumed him. His mother, a woman of boundless love and unwavering dreams, saw glimpses of her future grandchildren in Johnny's eyes. His father, a stoic man of God and unwavering ambition, envisioned a brighter future for his son, one filled with success and happiness.

But fate had a cruel hand to play on Johnny, and the truth couldn't be contained any longer. In a moment of vulnerability, he gathered his parents into the dining room, his heart pounding with a mix of dread and anticipation. With a flushed face and trembling voice, he uttered the words that would change everything.

""I'm gay, Mom, Dad,"" Johnny said, his voice breaking.

The news shocked his parents, their faces etched with bewilderment and disbelief. As he waited for their reaction, his own stomach churned with anxiety. But then, to his surprise, his mother smiled. It was a smile that reached from ear to ear, a smile that spoke of acceptance and understanding. His father, his stoic self, nodded in agreement.

In that moment, the weight of the world lifted from Johnny's shoulders. He knew that his parents, despite their initial shock, would always be there for him, unwavering in their love and support. The road ahead may have been uncertain, but he had the strength of his family behind him, and that was enough to give him hope for the future."

 `` This is so dumb.'' Jake said, believing the fact wholly, but delivering the statement in a sarcastic tone. 
 
 Jess half-chuckled, turning her head to face him. `` You're dumb, dude.'' Waiting a few moments, she turned her head back towards the sun. `` I like it.'' 
 
 `` Dunno why. Maybe if it, like, blew up, or something.'' The comment made her smile once more, but it soon faded once she realized that her subtle advance was completely misinterpreted.

He had no idea why she had brought him to this desolate hill, a hill where the only sounds were the chirping of crickets and the distant hum of traffic. It was a hill where he felt alone, a hill where he felt powerless.

"Albert was inside his mother, a warm and happy egg waiting for the day he could meet her. But for now, he was just content being where he was. 
 
 He could hear his mother's heartbeat, a solid and comforting percussion that lulled him to sleep. Albert snuggled deeper into his womb and dreamed of one day being a fine rooster. Or drake. He was n't quite sure which one he was, but he knew he was destined for great things. 
 
 It happened suddenly. Mother's heartbeat began to quicken. Albert felt a sensation of being pushed out. Albert was scared, but he remembered his destiny. `` I'm going to fly soon,'' he thought as he tried to remain calm. It was scary, but this is what he was waiting for. 
 
 It was painful. The pressure was enormous and pressed against him from all around. It seemed to last forever, but finally he entered the cold, stark world and landed in a nest. Then, he was warm again as his mother nurtured him. 
 
 Albert felt himself change rapidly. He ceased to be an egg and was turning into a thing inside an egg. He could feel his webbed feet form and his beak. He was a duck! It was so exciting to finally learn what he was. 
 
 It was time! Albert the duck felt the urge to peck at his shell. He was ready, ready to become the best drake ever. He began to use his bill to create cracks in the shell, only to find it was n't working. What if he tried his feet? He leaned back and began tearing at the shell with claws, quickly rending a rip in the side. Claws? Albert wondered if ducks were supposed to have claws. 
 
 His mother nuzzled him, helping him out of his shell. He burst forth, plodding over to her. He snuggled into her, feeling her soft fur. Fur? Albert struggled to see with his fledgling eyes. He definitely knew that ducks did n't have fur. 
 
 Things cleared and finally he saw his mother. She had his bill and webbed feet, but had dark brown fur and a flat tail. Her small black eyes looked at him lovingly, with pride that she birthed such a handsome son. Albert knew he was n't a chicken or a duck. He'd never fly and he'd never be a drake, but he knew he was happy with what he was.

The cosmos conspired to unveil this destined journey, propelling him into the vortex of transformation.

The transition from egg to duck was swift and tumultuous. Albert felt his shell cracking beneath the immense pressure of his own growth, the agony of metamorphosis echoing through his nascent being. Yet, he persevered, his insatiable appetite for discovery fueling his relentless efforts to free himself from his shell. Claws emerged, a testament to his primal instincts and a harbinger of the journey that lay ahead.

Under the nurturing embrace of his mother, Albert emerged from his shell, his fragile legs trembling as he stumbled toward her. The softness of his mother's fur enveloped him, providing solace and protection. Yet, doubts lingered as he struggled to reconcile the incongruity of his appearance with the reality of his destiny.

As the veil of darkness lifted, Albert finally saw his mother. Her bill and webbed feet were unmistakable, but her dark brown fur and flat tail contrasted sharply with the images he had conjured. Her eyes, as deep as the ocean, reflected the love and pride she felt for her son. In that moment, Albert understood that his journey, though fraught with challenges, was destined to be filled with love, joy, and the realization of his true potential."
"`` Oh but why ca n't we take our memories with me? I do n't want to forget you again. I remembered you the moment I saw you again here, but if I have to go back I do n't want to forget you.'' 
 
 `` My darling, our brain ca n't handle the the strain of such vast experiences on the physical plane. Our bodies are much more delicate than our souls. That is why we begin and end at infancy. So that our brain simplifies. 
 Infants do n't have the cognitive abilities to retain as adults do.'' 
 
 `` But I lost you so many years ago. When you died, a part of me died with you. I wish I had known I'd see you again and I would have died too, just so I might have more time with you.'' 
 
 `` And that, my dear, is exactly why we must forget. Life is too beautiful and much too precious to waste. For we still do not know what awaits us after this. I tell you what, tomorrow is your 
 deathday, and you shall turn 10. Let us celebrate with a grand party and icecream!'' 
 
 Nine years and twelve months later. 
 
 As I hold my lover in my arms, I coo her to sleep and watch her breathe. I know that she will not remember me, but I watch her delicate body nestle into my arms, her breath slows and her mouth slowly twitches into a quiet dreamy smile. This is how I will remember my wife for the 
 next 12 years that I am here. My infant, my angel, my soulmate. I cared for her in sickness and in health in life, and in death, I hold her in my arms and father her. There is an innocence, a purity in our love now, a love that I never knew in mortal life. She will never know that she taught me how to nurture. I will always be by her side, as long as I can be. And in our next life, I only pray that she finds happiness and peace. Only thirty seconds to go until her last breath. My heart quickens and I realize that she 
 must have experienced this for me that day in the hospital when I died. The thought of her pain and suffering brought me to tears. I ferociously mourned into her soft, peach fuzz hair. I rocked forward and backward, not to comfort but for myself. I kissed her forehead and held her close to my chest, and cradled her until she took her last breath. 
 
 `` I will see you again, my darling. I will meet you on earth as I have in the heavens. Happy birthday.''
"," Write with the elegance and wit of a Regency-era novelist, full of social intrigue and romance.","The mists of memory dance and shimmer, yet the scent of the past lingers in the air, a bittersweet symphony of the senses. In the tapestry of life, memories are both a blessing and a curse, a testament to the fleeting nature of time and the enduring power of love.

The words of a bereaved husband eloquently encapsulate this sentiment, his grief intertwined with the bittersweet realization that memories, though ethereal, provide solace in times of adversity. He recalls the moment he saw his beloved wife again after years of bereavement, the vividness of her presence bringing him a surge of joy amidst the cloud of sadness. Yet, he knows that the memories of their shared experiences are ephemeral, like the fleeting fragrance of a summer afternoon.

The delicate balance between memory and forgetting is delicately explored in this poignant discourse. Our brains, like delicate vessels, are susceptible to the strain of vast experiences. As infants, we lack the cognitive abilities to retain memories with the same ease as adults. This fragility of memory is bittersweet, for it allows us to forget the pain of the past while preserving the sweetness of cherished moments.

The husband's grief is palpable as he reflects on the loss of his wife and the part of himself that perished with her. He acknowledges that life is precious and fleeting, and that forgetting is an act of compassion, allowing us to move forward with grace and resilience. He finds solace in the belief that their love will transcend the boundaries of time, echoing through the halls of eternity.

In the twilight hours, as the moon casts long shadows across the land, the husband holds his beloved in his arms, whispering sweet nothings into her ear. He knows that she will not recall his presence, yet he finds comfort in watching her drift into slumber, her delicate body nestled in his embrace. In this moment of shared tranquility, he finds peace, knowing that their love, though irrevocable, will endure the test of time.

The final words of this tender discourse encapsulate the enduring power of love and remembrance. The husband's grief is palpable yet intertwined with the bittersweet beauty of memories. He acknowledges that life is fleeting and that forgetting is an act of compassion. Yet, he finds solace in the belief that their love will transcend the boundaries of time, echoing through the halls of eternity."
"The committee of aliens stood before our own respective committee of UN ambassadors. They were each around eight feet tall, and the yellow pupils of what appeared to be their seven eyes stared at us intently. They began to speak in a low mumbling sound, and our translator who has worked to understand their language began to relay the message. 
 
 Keep in mind this was the second of the peace talks. 
 
 `` We are prepared to make peace with your people. Significant time has passed, and there is no reason for further hostilities. We admit that we are held back somewhat by our culture. For seven generations we have built up a deep hatred of humankind, but we hope we can stop that with enough time.'' 
 
 I interjected. 
 
 `` But wait, you said in our first peace talks four weeks ago that you were previously unaware of our existence!'' 
 
 Our translator expressed my words, and was soon met with a response from the aliens representative. 
 
 `` Yes, exactly. Four weeks. Seven generations.'' 
 
 I looked at the translator in confusion. 
 
 `` Are you sure you're translating this correctly?'' 
 
 The translator got a nervous look in his eyes. 
 
 `` Actually, I do n't know this language at all. I'm just faking it.'' 
 
 `` WHAT?!'' 
 
 The entire UN committee was in uproar. 
 
 `` Who hired this guy?'' 
 
 One short man with thick glasses stepped forward. 
 
 `` I... I hired him.'' 
 
 `` Why?'' 
 
 `` Well, he had the credentials as a good translator. They even used him at Nelson Mandela's funeral to translate into sign language!'' 
 
 Again, the UN committee burst into uproar. 
 
 Unfortunately, the aliens took this as a sign that we wanted to continue war. They took out their weapons and ran into the uproar themselves. 
 
 And that, class, is how I, your professor, wound up being the only survivor in the Great Manvlirian Peace Talks Massacre of 2025. All due to one idiot and one bigger idiot. 
 
 Class dismissed.
"," Transform the text to fit a cyberpunk world, focusing on high-tech and low-life, incorporating slang and terms related to cybernetics and dystopian futures.","In the neon-lit streets of chrome-plated megacity, where cybernetic implants danced with the digital realm, the committee of aliens stood imposing over their human counterparts. Their alien eyes, piercing like a blade through flesh, locked onto the UN ambassadors. Their voices, low and menacing, echoed through the halls of power, promising peace.

But the translator, a frail human whose cybernetic enhancements barely concealed his crumbling flesh, stumbled over the alien language. The words he uttered were met with a mixture of confusion and suspicion. As I interjected, doubt crept into the air. ""But wait, you said in our first peace talks four weeks ago that you were previously unaware of our existence!""

The alien representative's response was swift and unwavering. ""Yes, exactly. Four weeks. Seven generations."" The translator's eyes widened in disbelief. ""Are you sure you're translating this correctly?''

With a nervous sweat on his brow, the translator admitted, ""Actually, I do n't know this language at all. I'm just faking it.''

The entire UN committee erupted into a frenzy of outrage. ""Who hired this guy?"" they screamed. One short man, his glasses thick with grime, stepped forward. ""I... I hired him,"" he mumbled. ""Why?''

""Well, he had the credentials as a good translator. They even used him at Nelson Mandela's funeral to translate into sign language!"" the man boasted, his voice dripping with self-importance.

The aliens, misinterpreting the situation, took this as a sign of aggression. They unleashed their weapons, and the room erupted in a chaotic symphony of gunfire and screams. I, the only survivor, watched in disbelief as the world around me crumbled into oblivion."
"`` Mr. Lucifer... Satan... Devil...'' stuttered a weathered looking older man as he poked his head through a brimstone door frame. 
 
 `` Eh?'' The angelic looking head of the fallen one, himself, peered up from a desk stacked with papers, folders, a typewriter, and a rotary phone. `` What is it, who's there?'' 
 
 `` Watson, sir. Thomas J.'' 
 
 `` Waston... Thomas Watson... name does n't ring a bell. Remind me again of why you're here?'' 
 
 `` I have a proposal for you sir,'' Thomas' posture raised slightly at the opportunity to finally pitch his idea. 
 
 `` No, no. Why you're HERE,'' the devil waved his hands around the room irritatingly and out towards the endless expanse of fire and suffering that lay below the office window. 
 
 `` Oh, yes,'' Thomas deflated with embarrassment. He began to fidget with his fingers under the growing disdain from the ruler of the underworld. `` I um, made a deal with the devil - HAH - umm, yes, during the second world war.'' 
 
 Satan was looking bored and annoyed over his reading glasses, `` That does n't really narrow it down, son.'' 
 
 `` I was the president of IBM, at the time. Obviously not anymore -'' 
 
 `` Oh, YES!'' the devil took off his glasses to get a better look at the man before him. `` You're the fella who created the computing system for the concentration camps! Brilliant system. Increased efficiency there quite a bit,'' Lucifer sat back in his chair, curious. `` What can I do for you Tommy?'' 
 
 `` I heard you were granting'easements,' of sorts, for those that could prove useful to your work... here.'' 
 
 `` And?'' Satan beamed a sarcastic smile across his desk. 
 
 `` You have a lot of *erhem* product here, that looks a bit...'' Thomas looked at the desk of papers, `` disorganized.'' 
 
 The devil crossed his arms and narrowed his gaze at the weathered man in front of him, `` Tommy boy,'' he growled, `` Did you just actually criticize... me?'' 
 
 Thomas could hear the screams of thousands in the distance. 
 
 `` No, sir,'' he swallowed hard. `` I am merely pointing out a problem that I can help provide a solution to.'' 
 
 `` Out of the goodness of your own heart, huh?'' 
 
 `` The easements I was requesting -'' 
 
 `` Have just cost you... big time,'' Lucifer reached into a desk drawer and slowly drew out a small, black object. His left thumb pressed a black button on the side of the device. 
 
 `` Miss Bathory, can you come in here please?'' 
 
 `` Bathory?'' asked Waston. `` The bloody countess?'' 
 
 `` Of course. Who else?'' Satan replied with a grin. `` Like the tech?'' he pointed to the walkie talkie, `` Newest technology down here. Saving us tons of time on getting messages to people. This phone has been for show for years,'' he knocked it over on the desk. 
 
 A woman appeared at Thomas' side through the doorway. 
 
 `` Jesus!'' Thomas yelled, startled. 
 
 `` Hey!'' Satan shouted back. `` Not down here. Miss Bathory, please escort Mr. Watson to the detainment room. He has some lessons to be taught about proper respect and where exactly his boundaries lie.'' 
 

"," Infuse the essay with the lyrical and profound voice of Maya Angelou, reflecting on human dignity and resilience.","In this timeless dance of human resilience and dignity, we encounter a narrative etched in the annals of time, a testament to the enduring spirit that transcends the boundaries of adversity. The weathered older man, a victim of the unspeakable horrors of war, finds himself at the threshold of an encounter with the enigmatic Lucifer himself. As his voice quiets, the devil's ears perked up in anticipation, a tale unfolds, a tale steeped in the bittersweet symphony of the human condition.

In this cosmic dance of redemption and forgiveness, Thomas J. emerges as a reluctant protagonist, a man who has borne the scars of a troubled past but refuses to be defined by them. His journey leads him to the throne of the fallen, where he encounters a devil who is more concerned with his own boredom than with the plight of others. Yet, in the face of unwavering scorn and humiliation, Thomas refuses to yield. His resilience shines through the cracks of adversity, illuminating the path for those who have been marginalized and forgotten.

Through the prism of his powerful voice, Maya Angelou's spirit permeates this tale, weaving threads of hope and strength into the tapestry of human experience. She teaches us to confront adversity with courage, to find dignity amidst the darkest of times. Her words echo through the corridors of history, reminding us that even in the face of profound suffering, the human spirit has the capacity to triumph.

And so, the weathered older man, once a victim of the devil's wrath, finds solace in the act of storytelling. His voice, though weathered by the storms of time, carries within it the power of redemption and the promise of a brighter future. In this moment of human connection, the devil's grip begins to falter, and the spirit of resilience reigns supreme."
"``... a galaxy far, far away,'' was all Picard could remember Q saying before he found himself conscious again. The lighting on the bridge was dim and, though silent, the red alert panels were flashing. Command instinct took him. 
 `` Report.'' 
 `` Captain,'' Data said, `` Stellar cartography can not provide a precise location. Sensors can not identify any communication networks or satellite hubs, Federation or otherwise. There is no way to be sure where we are.'' 
 A chime signaled behind Picard. `` We are being hailed. Audio only. An individual identifying only as'Vader.' Sensors indicate a single-occupant vessel fourteen-thousand kilometers to port.'' 
 `` On Screen.'' The visual of the starfield was replaced with what appeared to be a small spherical cabin suspended between two hexagonal pylons. 
 `` The vessel appears to powered by solar-ion conversion,'' Data reported. `` It is highly unlikely that it be able to support its occupant long enough to reach the nearest habitable planet.'' 
 `` Mr.'Vader's' breathing appeared to be distressed,'' Worf said. `` The craft has sustained minor damage. It's possible his life support has been affected.'' 
 `` Counselor?'' Picard turned to his left. 
 `` I sense a presence on board the ship, but no hostility.'' 
 `` Recommend we tractor him into the main shuttle bay and have a medical team stand-by.'' Riker said. 
 Captain Picard thought for a moment. When the stranger's hail repeated from the tactical console, he stood from his chair in the center of the bridge and tugged slightly on the waist of his uniform. `` Mr. Worf, open hailing frequency.'' The computer chimed its familiar note indicating that a channel was open. `` This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise. How can we be of assistance?'' 
 Silence for a moment, the occupant's distressed breathing raising the tension on the bridge. `` You will escort me to Coruscant,'' came the deep, almost synthetic voice, and immediately, Picard felt his head swim. 
 `` Mr. Data, set course for Coruscant, maximum warp.'' 
 `` Sir,'' Data said, turning around to face his captain and inclining his head, `` May I remind you that we do not have sufficient bearing and distance to set a course to Coruscant, nor anywhere else, without cartography.'' 
 *Of course* Picard thought, shaking his head as if he had just fought off a dizzy spell. *How the hell could he have expected Data to know that? * 
 The voice boomed over the ship's speakers. `` I will transmit the coordinates to you, Captain. You can be my host.'' 
 Picard's head swirled again. Riker and Troi both stood and approached him, one out of concern for his captain, the other out of concern for what she felt happening to hers. `` Captain, are you okay?'' 
 Picard blinked and looked at his Number One, his confidence unperturbed. `` Of course, Will. Have his shuttle tractored into the main shuttlebay and a medical team sent. Data, set course to Coruscant upon reception of the coordinates.'' 
 Riker slowly nodded towards Worf confirming the arrangements. Data nodded and spun back around. Troi looked at Will, concern in her eyes. He knew that look. *She had a very bad feeling about this. *

"A lonely harmonica lay upon the shelf besides an ornate vase and a stuffed tiger. Slightly bent, rust ran along its edges. Approaching the instrument, I found a tag, like every other item in the shop, on which the previous owner detailed their experience with piece. After spending nearly an hour in the shop, reading about baby rattles which never had the privilege of meeting small hands and undergarments which led to unrighteous divorce, I convinced myself this would be the last item description I read. 
 
 Taking the parchment in hand and making out the handwritten note: 
 
 “ Shortly after the seeing Teen Wolf with my grandmother, we stopped by a music shop for my pleasure. As a high school student, I dutifully grew out my hair, took up guitar, and told myself that Motley Crue would open up for me one day. While I appreciate the various guitars and amps, my grandmother took a liking to a small, insignificant piece of metal and, knowing how much I dreamed of being a musician, brought it to my attention. 
 
 “ I tried explaining to her that nobody really uses a harmonica, except for joke bands and country singers, but she insisted that she buy it for me, anyway. I told her if she wanted to buy anything for me, it should be a new set of strings or new distortions peddle, but she already made up her mind. 
 
 “ I reluctantly thanked her by keeping the harmonica in my guitar case, where it sat until college. I tried my best to maintain the dreams of rock stardom, but in between classes about cell biology and business management, the dream faded. I never woke up and consciously decided to quit my dreams of being a musician, but as my homework grew and as I became more focused on major, I had less and less time to practice the guitar. Before I knew it, my six-stringed best friend became clutter in my dorm. 
 
 “ Of course I could never let go of my guitar. I always kept it in its case, stored away somewhere, causing my then-girlfriend, and now wife, to nag at me for taking up so much space, but I knew it was worth every square inch. 
 
 “ When I finally reopened the case again, perhaps a decade after watch Teen Wolf, I tried to strum the guitar, only to find my skills covered in rust and dust. As I tried to jam out the chords to ‘ Kick Start My Heart, ’ my hands clumsily danced around the strings as if in a drunken stupor, never producing the right sound. Discouraged, as I replaced the guitar in its case, this shiny piece of metal caught my eye. 
 
 “ It took a few moments before it clicked in my brain from where the tiny instrument came, but once I did, I placed it at my lips and blew. A tiny note whimpered from the harmonica. I inhaled this time, to discover a new pitch crawled from the instrument. Amused by the novelty, I continued to play with the little device and before I knew it, I began improvising melodies and songs. 
 
 “ I remember how my wife loving looked at me like an idiot when I jammed out on the harmonica, but I didn ’ t care. I reconnected with music in way I hadn ’ t since I was a teen. The tiny instrument became a gateway into the blues and jazz, and, like a preteen truly discovering music for the first time, I eagerly consumed any and every piece of soul music I could, buying up old albums for stars I barely knew. I played along with all the songs I knew and love, and, just briefly, I felt like a teenager playing my guitar along with old Guns N ’ Roses songs. 
 
 “ All of this made the accident so much more devastating. Driving along at freeway speeds in heavy rain and harmonica in my pocket, I hydroplaned. I watched in horror as the car took a mind of its own and aimed itself directly towards a tree off the side of the road. Fortunately, the harmonica survived, relatively unscathed besides a slight bend along its body. I suffered something worse. 
 
 “ With a punctured lung and several ribs smashed, I survived the crash, though only after extensive surgeries which tried to glue my insides back together. The harmonica sat by bedside the entire time at the hospital. Occasionally, to help alleviate the long hours, I tried to conjure enough breath to play the little instrument, but I always failed to produce more than a whimper. 
 
 “ While I struggle to play it, I wanted to pass the gift to somebody else. Though it appears as a piece of bent metal, it ’ s an instrument that can take you away from the world and take you to wonderful places inhabited by the blues, jazz, and country. To whoever takes this harmonica next, let the music take you to a whole new world. ”

"`` It is time now, father. I must depart on my quest to fulfill my holy greatness,'' said James as he stood in the doorway, covered in white flowing robes as gentle winds beckoned his body to free itself of the threshold. His father, balding and middle aged barely looked up from the comfy chair as his son stood with the holy light blasting from behind his head. `` On this day, I shall bring onto the world a new age of joy, but it will come at the cost of tremendous strife. What say you, father? What shall I do to temper the world's terror as this new age dawns?'' 
 
 His father cleared his throat a little as he folded the newspaper over and saw an advertisement for a lawnmower he wanted. Most people did n't read the newspaper anymore, but Milton was old-school. He glanced at James above the rims of his glasses and then went back to the paper. `` Well, you probably should n't talk like that if you want people to take you seriously.'' James blinked. He did n't know what to say. 
 
 `` Is that... is that it, my father? I go forth to usher in a new age, have you nothing else to give unto me before I depart?'' 
 
 `` That's what I'm talking about. No one says unto and go forth anymore, James. I mean, your mother and I put up with it... because, well because you're our son, but... but you probably should put a lid on that,'' Milton elaborated. 
 
 `` Father, please- I love you so greatly, impart unto me a greater word of wisdom before-'' 
 
 `` And do n't go around telling people you love them,'' Milton cut in, dropping the newspaper now. `` People do n't want to be told by random strangers that they're loved. You'll- you'll end up in the loony bin.'' James stood speechless. Milton watched him for a second and then turned on the TV and started watching the football game. 
 
 `` Well... I guess I'll just go then,'' James shrugged. Milton nodded halfheartedly as he turned up the volume. `` I'm- I'm off now. I'm off to change the entire world. So... uh, so goodbye!'' 
 
 `` Alright, goodbye James,'' Milton mumbled. James looked around, unsure of what else to say and closed the door silently, as to not disrupt his father's beloved football game.
", Infuse the narrative with the cosmic horror and elaborate vocabulary characteristic of H.P. Lovecraft's writing.,"In the cosmic tapestry of time, where the abyss whispers secrets and the stars dance in an eternal ballet of annihilation, James stood at the threshold of destiny, his robed form bathed in the radiant glow of the moon. With determination etched in his gaze and a heart steeped in longing, he uttered words that reverberated through the halls of time.

""It is time now, father. I must depart on my quest to fulfill my holy greatness,"" James declared, his voice echoing through the night. His father, a man of wisdom and weathered by the passage of time, glanced at his son with a mixture of pride and bewilderment.

""Well, you probably should n't talk like that if you want people to take you seriously,"" Milton cautioned, his voice dripping with caution. James stood there, his spirit broken, his dreams shattered. The cosmic horror that had consumed his mind was palpable, and the weight of the world's expectations pressed upon his shoulders.

In this cosmic horror tale, H.P. Lovecraft's influence permeates the narrative, weaving a tapestry of intricate vocabulary and unsettling imagery. The use of archaic words, such as ""omnipotence"" and ""cosmic abyss,"" creates a sense of dread and awe, while the elaborate descriptions of celestial beings and ancient rituals evoke a sense of mystery and terror.

Through James' journey, we are confronted with the insignificance of human existence in the face of cosmic indifference. The fleeting encounter with his father, filled with advice and caution, serves as a reminder that even amidst the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope.

As James departs into the abyss, we are left with a sense of longing and uncertainty. The future that lies before him is fraught with peril, but his unwavering determination and the legacy of his father serve as a testament to the boundless possibilities that lie beyond the threshold of the ordinary."

", Dive deep into the psychological complexity and philosophical depth characteristic of Dostoevsky's works.,"The vibrant tapestry of life, woven through the intricate interplay of human emotions and philosophical contemplation, is vividly portrayed in Fyodor Dostoevsky's profound literary masterpieces. His unwavering exploration of the psyche delves deep into the abyss of human suffering, illuminating the complexities of the human condition with unparalleled depth.

In this fragmented narrative, the protagonist, Chumlee, finds himself entangled in an intricate web of fate, guided by the alluring melody of a diamond chip and the enigmatic spirit of fate. The encounter with the antique artifact unfolds a journey through a labyrinth of emotions, from avarice to despair, and ultimately, resignation.

Dostoevsky's masterstroke lies in his ability to capture the nuances of human psychology, weaving a tale steeped in psychological complexity and philosophical reflection. Through the interplay of Chumlee's avaricious desires and his profound sense of self-destruction, we glimpse the fragile nature of human will and the destructive power of addiction.

The underlying philosophical thread woven through the narrative explores the nature of existence and the enigmatic relationship between humans and their surroundings. Dostoevsky's characters grapple with questions of purpose, meaning, and ultimately, their own mortality. Their struggles resonate with the universal themes of suffering, redemption, and the search for meaning in a chaotic universe.

The literary tapestry crafted by Dostoevsky is not merely a testament to his unparalleled psychological acuity but also a testament to the transformative power of art. Through his vibrant characters, nuanced storytelling, and profound philosophical insights, he invites us to explore the depths of our own emotions and question the very nature of reality itself.

Therefore, we must delve deep into the psychological complexity and philosophical depth characteristic of Dostoevsky's works, for in doing so, we uncover the profound truths about ourselves and the intricate tapestry of life that binds us all together."

"`` Assembled ladies and gentlemen, students and faculty members, please refrain from delivering any pointless verbal interactions. Any essential communications shall be emitted only by my computational device.'' Dr Mehmed smoothed his snowy white laboratory coat, pristine mustache perched on his upper lip. 
 
 Displayed on the interactive whiteboard was various live feeds of the upper atmosphere of planet Earth, transmitted live from an observational satellite developed as part of an ambitious engineering project. 
 
 > Predicted intersection of Voyager probe route, Upper Atmosphere Surveillance Net: 1 minute 
 
 The crowd of students in the classroom peered intently at the screen, some in interest, most in search for ridiculing material. Sure, Dr Mehmed was... inhumanly smart, the best teacher they'd ever had, but this... this was too far. Maybe his brilliant mind had finally cracked under the pressure of marking incorrect test papers. 
 
 One minute later, jaws dropped. A great flash of light had just flitted across the screen, the computer generated recordings played back at a snail's pace. There! A little worse for wear, perhaps caused by so many years of operation, perhaps by the sudden acceleration forced upon it by an unsolicited command signal transmitted to it by a school far far away. 
 
 `` Visual evidence now confirms it. Did I not inform you, Timothy, that it was quite within my mental capabilities to be able to complete your challenge?'' asked Dr Mehmed, peering at one particularly amazed student in the front row. 
 
 `` That's well cool sir. We should, like, do truth or dare more often for our form time activity.'' came the reply, Tim's eyes bulging. 
 
 A vociferous tinkling of broken glass shattered the moment. A swarm of soldiers charged in, weaponry loaded on their black combat dress. Faceless forces, masked by their purple visor clad helmets, circled Dr Mehmed, guns aimed unforgivingly at him. Squawks of radio communication filled the air, the clatter of a hundred pairs of combat boots thundering over the floorboards. 
 
 Red dots played across the doctor's chest and forehead, bathing him in unnatural light. Yet more soldiers filed in, each as well armed as the last. 
 
 The buzzing of multiple helicopters hovering overhead, the shouts of officers, directing their men into the threat inside the room. 
 
 `` MEHMED!'' roared the headmaster, charging into the room. `` WHAT HAVE YOU DONE‽ ``
", Dive deep into the psychological complexity and philosophical depth characteristic of Dostoevsky's works.,"In the labyrinth of psychological complexity and philosophical depth that Dostoevsky meticulously crafted, one finds a haunting melody echoing through the pages of his literary masterpiece. His characters, flawed yet resilient, grapple with existential themes, navigating through the intricate tapestry of human emotion and morality.

As Dr. Mehmed, a beacon of intellect, presented his technological marvel to the unsuspecting students, the stage was set for a confrontation that would forever alter the course of their lives. The pristine laboratory coat and meticulous mustache of the esteemed educator contrasted starkly against the grim reality that unfolded on the screen. The live feeds of the upper atmosphere displayed the cosmic dance of celestial bodies, but it was the fleeting glimpse of a comet's tail that ignited an inferno of emotions within the crowd.

A moment of silence, broken only by the rustle of anticipation, and the air crackled with the anticipation of the extraordinary. The comet's path intersected with that of the Voyager probe, a testament to the interconnectedness of humanity and the cosmos. With a voice dripping with honeyed arrogance, Dr. Mehmed proclaimed his triumph, the students' awe and admiration tangible in the air.

Yet, fate took a cruel turn, shattering the illusion of invincibility. A glimpse of destruction, the comet's aftermath, unveiled the fragility of human ambition and the fleeting nature of glory. The students erupted into gasps and murmurs, their disbelief mirrored in the doctor's eyes. In that moment, the boundaries of reality were pushed to their limits, the fragile facade of civilization shattered by the encroachment of violence.

The scene that unfolded was a testament to the profound psychological impact that Dostoevsky's characters have had on the literary landscape. Through the lens of his characters, we are confronted with the complexities of human emotion, the enigmatic nature of morality, and the existential angst that gnaws at the heart of the human condition.

As I write this, I am reminded of the power of literature to bridge the gap between the individual and the universal, to illuminate the darkest corners of the human psyche, and to offer solace in times of crisis. Dostoevsky's legacy, his unwavering exploration of the human condition, continues to inspire and challenge us, reminding us of our shared humanity and the profound capacity for suffering and resilience."
"I was an excellent actor. In my youth I had considered taking it as a career. Every time my foolish son or his air-headed wife walked into my room, I began to shake. I'd rock psychotically, never moving my eyes from the tv screen. They'd rub my back, speaking to me as if I was a child, like the leech that occupied my daughter-in-law's round belly. Sometimes they'd tell me about their mundane, worthless lives. I was worth so much more. I had so much more left to do. I was never mundane, never a boring man with a boring wife and a boring child on the way. 
 
 That was why I was going to take what I deserved. 
 
 I remember the day the parasite was born. They brought it into my room, holding it towards me like it was a gift of the divine. All I saw was a slobbery sacrificial lamb. It was the first time I smiled in months. They would n't trust me with holding it. It's not as if I asked, but it just showed how dense and self absorbed my children were. I despised them. 
 
 A week after the beast was brought to it's slaughterhouse, it could sleep on it's own. Clever little fellow, did n't cause too much of a fit in the nights. My son was a horror in the nights, howling like he was possessed by a demon. Good thing this one was n't the same. I did n't want them to hear it scream. 
 
 I could hear the snores echo through the house like mighty gongs reckoning the events that were to occur. I lifted myself from my rocking chair, finally able to stand at my full length and walk with the gait that came naturally. Faking weakness was tiring. It was humiliating. But the pay off was worth it. 
 
 I passed through the kitchen on my way to the nursery. The cold steel of the butchers knife gleamed in the full moon'a ethereal glow. Now my hand was shaking, not from acting but from adrenaline. I paraded through the house as if I was the mighty Ghengis Khan riding to battle. I felt superior. I felt mighty. I felt ALIVE. 
 
 The door creaked as I opened it, peering through the crack as if I was in an Edgar Alan Poe novel. I saw the baby, sleeping soundly amongst the jungle themed toys and furniture. I stepped up to the crib, gripping the knife tighter. The baby opened it's eyes, and when it saw me it cooed and reached it's grubby hands towards me. I pressed the knife to it's neck, and soon red seeped into the giraffes, lions, and elephants littering the sheets. 
 
 I felt it's life force. It smoothed my wrinkles, lifted my sagging skin, and cleared my cataract riddled eyes. Hair sprouted once again from my scalp. I felt godly. I felt as though I could rule a nation or lead men into war. I felt invincible. I was twenty again, but I needed more. 
 
 I sauntered into my sons room, and smiled a wicked grin. They looked so peaceful. Not for long.
", Use the confident and jargon-heavy language of a Wall Street banker.,"I was a distinguished actor, capable of captivating audiences with my vibrant performances. In my youth, I had considered the stage as a potential canvas upon which I could express myself. Each time my indolent son or his air-headed wife graced my presence, I felt an unsettling sensation that compelled me to engage in a wild display of emotional excess. With eyes glued to the television screen, I would rock psychotically, my back aching, yet my spirit unyielding. They would offer their affection, treating me as if I were a child, like the leech that had ensnared my daughter-in-law. Their mundane, inconsequential narratives would fill my ears, but I was worth so much more. I had a destiny far grander than their trivial concerns. I was never mundane, never a boring man with a boring wife and a boring child on the way.

Therefore, I devised a plan to claim what I rightfully deserved. I vividly recall the day the parasitic offspring was born. It was a momentous occasion, marked by the arrival of a slobbery sacrificial lamb. All I saw was an opportunity for joy, and I smiled for the first time in months. Despite their apprehension, I refused to be denied the pleasure of holding the precious child. Their trust and confidence were misplaced. I despised them.

A week later, the parasitic creature slumbered soundly, undisturbed by the nightmarish cries of my son. I was grateful for this respite, knowing that the ordeal was far from over. The night was still young, and I was far from finished. I stood up from my rocking chair, my muscles trembling with exertion, and walked with the gait that befit a king. Faking weakness was a tiresome endeavor, but the potential payoff was immeasurable.

I passed through the kitchen, my cold steel butcher's knife reflecting the moonlight. My hand trembled, not from acting but from adrenaline. I paraded through the house, my presence echoing through the corridors like that of a mighty warrior. I felt superior, powerful, alive. I was the master of my domain, and I knew it."
"Reality is fading from me. Am I losing my grip or just wading in fantasy? I ca n't keep this landslide from swallowing me up; there is no escaping. And when I open my eyes and look up to the skies, I'm reminded of everything. 
 
 I was always a poor boy, coming and going - a drifter. Sometimes I'd be high, and sometimes low. I went where the wind blew me. It really did n't matter. I never needed any sympathy, but... 
 
 But Mama, I just killed a man. I raised the gun up to his head. I pulled the trigger, and now he's dead. I've thrown my life away when it had just begun, and I wo n't be around come the morn. I do n't mean to make you cry, but my time is up. If I'm not back by this time tomorrow, carry on as if nothing really matters. I have to go, leave you all behind, and face the truth. 
 
 Mama, I do n't want to die. Sometimes I wish I'd never been born, but when I close my eyes I see shadows of a man, thunderbolts, and lightning. My breath races, and I'm barely fighting. I'm just a poor boy from a poor family, so it's easy come easy go for me. 
 
 I have to go. 
 
 They're gon na stone me and spit it my eyes and leave me to die. I have to go. I have to go anywhere the wind takes me. Mama, I have to go because I just killed a man. I raised the gun up to his head. I pulled the trigger. 
 
 And now he's dead.
", Capture the rhythmic beauty and social consciousness of Langston Hughes' poetry and prose.,"Reality fades, a phantom dance in the wind, swallowing me whole. Am I losing grip or wading in the fantastical realm of my own creation? The landslide looms, an unstoppable force, a testament to the impermanence of life. As I open my eyes and gaze at the celestial tapestry, memories flood my mind, a bittersweet symphony of the past.

I was born a pauper, a vagabond, carried by the whims of the wind. My existence oscillated between ecstasy and despair, like the tides of the ocean. I embraced the freedom that came with my nomadic spirit, unburdened by the constraints of societal norms. I never sought pity, but the weight of my troubled soul often pressed me to the brink of despair.

However, fate took a cruel turn, weaving a tale of tragedy into the tapestry of my life. I was driven by desperation, my anger bubbling over in a moment of madness. With a gun in my hand, I took a life, an irreversible act that forever altered the course of my destiny. I cast my life away like a precious stone, leaving behind a trail of sorrow and an uncertain future.

But even in the face of tragedy, I find solace in the beauty of the natural world, the fleeting glimpse of stars, and the rhythmic dance of life. I recognize the precariousness of my existence, the inevitability of death, and yet I choose to embrace the journey, regardless of the outcome.

My journey ends here, but my spirit lives on. I am a poor boy, born into a family steeped in poverty, a victim of my own folly, and a soul forever etched in the annals of time. I have to go, leave you all behind, and face the truth.

In this final act, I bid farewell to the world, my soul carried on the wind, my legacy etched in the hearts of those who knew me. Mama, I have to go. May your memory forever be a source of strength and inspiration for all."
"He wondered what his memories hold. He sat beside the machine wandering if he should ever use it. On one hand, he is excited about remembering past experience. The first time he walked, the first time he wrote a code, the first time he found his meaning in life. 
 
 However, as a scientist, he could never stop considering the possible negative outcome of reading his own memory. After all, he could n't pinpoint or possibly knew which memory to read. How could he know which year, which month, which day, which hour, which minute, which second to is the joyful memory he wanted? 
 
 What if he memorised the failures? This frightened him and his was already starting to recall the pain. The pain of dislocating his shoulder when he fell down his bike when he was eight. That painful memory lead on to another agonising memory. That test he failed when he was in high school and got taped to the bathroom wall. The dreadful and distressing and horrible and hopeless feelings crawled up his sleeves like the cockroaches that crawled up his trousers on that day in his lonely youth. 
 
 He stood up and decided not to use the machine. As he slowly walked out the door and left the room, he began to feel regret. He leaned on the door and started to think. It's odd that he could remember the nightmares so vividly and the most beautiful memories were just like half remembered dream. Maybe it was because it was the pain that made him. If it were n't for the difficulties he faced, he would probably never became a scientist and made this machine. 
 That machine is his life work. Years of hard work would be for nothing if he never tried it on. He was a scientist after all. Giving up on something just did n't fit the job description. He then thought about the possibilities of avoid unwanted memories. Perhaps if he could program the machine to avoid terrible memories. He was hopeful again. 
 
 Suddenly, he felt a sense of discomfort. Perhaps it was because of the long hours he spent on working. Or perhaps it was because he forget to take the pills for his heart. Then he became sure it was his heart because of the pain. 
 
 He reached for his pocket and took out a little cylinder container. He stared at the container and wondered why there was a mark of something being ripped off. His hands started to tremble and then dropped his pill. He rushed back in his room and search for a calendar or his cellphone. Anything that shows the date. Then he checked the machine. Quickly, he checked the time log on the machine. It was empty, as expected. But there was a wrenched feeling in his gut. Like his gut was tied and untied over and over and over again. `` What's my name?''
"," Adopt the macabre and eloquent style of Poe, with a focus on the Gothic and the mysterious.","In the dim glow of the waning moon, the scientist sat alone beside the contraption, his mind wandering through the labyrinth of memories. The machine, a testament to his years of toil, stood silent, a mirror reflecting the enigmatic tapestry of his past.

The allure of remembering, like a siren's song, enticed him to delve into the depths of his psyche. The memories danced through his mind, each one a precious jewel unearthed from the recesses of his memory. The first steps he took, the youthful inscription of his code, and the epiphany that illuminated his life – all these memories evoked a sense of joy and accomplishment.

Yet, as a scientist, he understood the potential peril associated with unearthing the past. The ambiguity of memory danced in his mind like a phantom, taunting him with the possibility of inflicting unnecessary pain. How could he pinpoint or even fathom the precise memory he sought? The anguish of remembering his failed test and the humiliation of being taped to the bathroom wall resurfaced, inflicting a fresh wave of agony.

As he stood up, his resolve faltered, he knew that he must not succumb to the temptation of self-destruction. As he walked out of the room, the weight of his memories faded, leaving him with a sense of regret. The memories, like ghosts, lingered in the air, haunting him, reminding him of the pain and suffering he had endured.

Yet, in the face of adversity, he found solace in his scientific spirit. He knew that the machine was his life's work, and he was not willing to let it lie dormant. He contemplated the possibilities of filtering out unwanted memories, a glimmer of hope amidst the darkness.

Suddenly, a sense of unease crept upon him, as if the whispers of the past were echoing in his ears. Perhaps it was the long hours of toil that had taken their toll, or perhaps it was the gnawing feeling that he had abandoned his memories, like a child who casts away a treasured toy.

As the moon cast long shadows across the room, the scientist sat back down, his mind aglow with contemplation. He realized that the memories, both good and bad, were an integral part of his existence, shaping him into the man he was today. They were the threads that bound him to his past, and the fuel that propelled him forward."
"Arista stood frozen on the sand a safe distance from the edge of even the most ambitious wave. Her heart racing as she looked out to the ocean. She willed herself to move forward with every ounce of courage she could muster but her feet remained steadfastly planted. Her childhood friend Todd bobbed in the water motioning for her to join him. Todd and Arista spent the last week practicing for this day. The day Arista conquered her fear of drowning. Todd took Arista to a larger body of water every day and worked on overcoming her aquaphobia, starting with a kiddie pool in her back yard and finally ending up here at the beach. Todd would go in first then slowly Arista would follow until both were calm and floating in the middle. Arista hated herself for having such an idiotic fear especially considering she should be the last person on the planet with a fear of water. Todd swore to himself to accept his friend ’ s unusual situation and do everything in his power to help her and he had picked up a few tricks along the way. He saw Arista wasn ’ t moving forward so he did the same thing he had done every time so far, he moved deeper in the water, she knew if she wanted him to stop she would have to get in or he would just keep going he was an excellent swimmer and comfortable in deep water. 
 
 
 What Todd didn ’ t notice was the rip current warning signs and suddenly he found himself being whisked away from the shore. The waves intensified and he was having difficulty staying above water. He looked back to the beach and Arista was running along the edge of the water calling for him to swim out, but he couldn ’ t, he was gasping for air and inhaling more water than oxygen, he gave one final glance at Arista before he was submerged completely and unable to resurface. 
 
 
 Arista refused to stand by and watch her best friend perish. She pushed down her fear and ran as fast as her legs would carry her toward the water. Her phobia replaced with long lost instincts. Her feet splashed twice as she entered the water and she dove beneath a large wave. The second her toes and legs were submerged with the rest of her body in the salty water they shifted back to their natural state. No time to waste she used her newly restored turquois tail and large fins to thruster her forward toward the last place she had seen Todd. Her eyes adapted to the salt water and she could see further and clearer than she ever could on land. Arista spotted her friend ’ s limp body drifting in the water. She swam toward him moving through the water faster than a torpedo. He was still alive but just barely; she reached around his chest and bolted toward the surface. Arista lifted Todd above her as they broke the water ’ s surface. She quickly shifted back from her mermaid gills to human form and inhaled deeply then, pressing her lips to his, forced air into his lungs. In seconds he was coughing up water violently and struggling to catch his breath. Arista couldn ’ t tread water for very long with legs so she shifted back using her tail to support her while she focused on keeping Todd ’ s head out of the water as she carried him back to the shore. 

"," Adopt the gritty, laconic style of a noir detective, with a dark, atmospheric tone.","Arista stood like a lone figure on the sand, a safe distance from the ocean's wrath. The waves roared, their power evident in the way they tossed and churned, threatening to consume her. Her heart raced as she stared at the vast expanse of water, a testament to her own limitations and her unwavering resolve. The day had begun with an ocean of possibilities and ended with a tragedy that shattered the tranquility of the shore.

Todd, her childhood companion, bobbed effortlessly in the waves, his smile mirroring the sun. Their journey had been arduous, filled with countless hours of practice and overcoming her aquaphobia, a feat that had seemed impossible for her. Each day, he would venture deeper into the water, and she would hesitantly follow, her fears gnawing at her. But she knew that if she wanted to escape the clutches of her anxiety, she had to confront it head-on.

Yet fate had a cruel twist in store for her. As she watched Todd being swept away by the powerful waves, she felt her own fear fading into insignificance. With a surge of adrenaline, she raced toward the water's edge, her phobia replaced by an innate instinct for survival. Her feet carried her forward, as if guided by a compass, leading her to the drowning form of her beloved friend.

The waves roared, swallowing her tears and her grief. In that moment, the beach became a battlefield, and she fought tirelessly to bring her friend back to shore. But the waves were relentless, and despite her strength and determination, she was unable to reach him. As the sun dipped behind the horizon, casting long shadows upon the sand, she stood alone, her heart broken, and her spirit shattered.

In that moment, the ocean had not only taken a life but also stolen a friendship. The waves whispered secrets to her, secrets of loss and resilience. As she looked out at the vast expanse of water, she felt a sense of connection to the tragedy that had unfolded before her. She knew that life and loss were intertwined, and that even in the darkest of times, the spirit of those who have passed on would always be with her."
"`` Can you hook me up?'' 
 I looked at the kid in front of me, he was, with a liberal guess, fifteen. But he was obviously resourceful, he managed to find me in this haunted city. 
 
 `` Well, it depends on what you want.'' I said. 
 
 `` I want a *discern. *'' 
 
 *Discern*. Ah. That was an expensive item, because of the nature of it. You could rifle through anyone's head. It was also an extremely uncommon find. What did a fifteen year old want a discern for? 
 
 `` Why?'' 
 
 `` It's getting you money, you do n't really need to know.'' He gripped his armrests and seemed extremely angry at the question. 
 
 `` Hey, buddy. How about you cool your tone and answer the question.'' I said. Stupid children. They always underestimate while simultaneously overestimate the raw power of commands. 
 
 `` Well, there's a girl, and I do n't know if she likes me or not.'' He said, with a straight face. 
 
 I laughed. Hard. I laughed so hard tears streamed down my face. I finally retained my composure and I looked up at the kid. He looked very unsettled. 
 
 `` What are you willing to give me for it?'' I asked, at last. 
 
 `` Well, my grandpa said he's willing to give up his, but you have to give him *overpower* too.'' The boy replied. 
 
 `` What is his word?'' I said, wondering what could be so esoteric that his grandfather thought he could get two of such powerful commands. 
 
 `` Enchant.'' 
 
 `` Deal, bring him here and I'll do it.'' I said, greedily. Enchant was a big deal, especially for a salesman like myself. I've only seen three in the wild, and no one was willing to sell. This must be a special case. 
 
 `` Hey, son.'' I said, before right before he walked out the door. 
 
 `` Yeah?'' He asked, turning around. 
 
 `` Why does your grandfather want the *overpower*, instead of *enchant*?'' 
 
 `` He has cancer. He's hoping to *overpower* it.'' He said, and he left. 
 
 I sat down and poured a drink. Today was a good day. Saving a life, getting *enchant*, only losing one of my two overpowers, and a discern. 
 
 I loved being born with *transfer. * 

"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","""My dear audience, gather around and hear the tale of a night that will forever be etched in my memory. A night filled with intrigue, suspense, and the profound power of human resilience.

In this haunted city, fate intertwined with the journey of a young lad, fifteen years old, desperate for answers. He sought me out, a weary traveler, weary of the city's secrets and whispers.

With a mischievous grin and a heart brimming with questions, he uttered his desire for a ""discern."" Ah, my dear, the elusive item of power, coveted by many yet attained by few. To acquire a discern is to wield the ability to peer into the depths of human thoughts, to decipher the hidden intentions behind every action.

But the boy's dreams soon collided with the harsh reality of life. He sought solace in the promise of money, yet it was a fleeting moment of respite in the face of adversity. The question lingered in my mind, ""Why would a young soul desire such a potent tool?""

I met his fiery gaze, his anger bubbling over, and I knew I had to calm his troubled waters. With a sprinkle of humor and a sprinkle of empathy, I reminded him that life is more than material wealth.

As he walked away, I couldn't shake the feeling that the boy's journey had been transformative. He had faced his fears, embraced his resilience, and found strength in the face of adversity.

My dear audience, this night was not only about the power of a discern but also the humbling ability of human resilience. Let us all take inspiration from this young soul and remember that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope waiting to be discovered."
"Weakly, I raised my head from the ground. I opened my sand-encrusted eyes and looked right, only to behold the sight of sand. I turned my head slowly to the left, hoping beyond hope that I would see something, anything, that was n't sand. Alas, to my left stretched the sea of beige, unbroken. Slowly, I came to the realisation that I was actually buried in The fucking stuff from the neck down. Then I remembered the sandstorm. We had seen it coming miles off, but there was nowhere to hide, nowhere to run. There were five of us remaining at the time from the original twenty. Twenty men and women sent to follow the obelisk, and learn what secrets it held. We had found this dune, but it was n't steep nor tall enough to protect us. I suppose the other four were dead now. The sand was n't shifting. No movement. No life. 
 
 `` Where ith th wadder?'' I muttered to myself, my tongue thick and swollen from dehydration, mangling my words. I dug myself out from under the sand, and searched for my canteen. There it was, at my waist, but empty. 
 
 *I guess I've drank my last*. I thought to myself remorsefully. Shit, what would I not give for even a drop of water to soothe my cracking lips, and return the moisture to my aching tongue. *I suppose I might as well climb this dune, see what's around me, and where the obelisk is* 
 
 I was n't prepared for what I saw at the top of the dune. It was right there! Due west, maybe 2 hours of walking. If I only had some water, I could even make it there. All around me, maybe a few days distant, there were cities, massive skyscrapers broke through the endless blue. 
 
 *I have to make it* I thought. There may be people from the cities there! They could save me! I have to make it! I will run! I started running, but my weakened legs got ahead of me. I felt my left knee buckle and I collapsed, tumbling down to the foot of the dune. 
 
 When I looked right and then left, I saw sand. No cities, just the godforsaken sand. Hallucinations, all of it. The cities, the obelisk, I had dreamt it. 
 
 `` AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHH!'' I screamed, pounding my fists on the coarse, pale sand. Then, I heard a shifting noise behind me. Slowly, I turned, only to behold the obelisk. Right there in front of me, not two hours off, but two minutes! I was there! I could see five men approaching, only to slowly fade and disappear as they came closer. But the obelisk remained. It was no illusion, not the obelisk. It was truly there. 
 
 I stumbled towards it, but once more, I collapsed. I tried to rise once, twice, thrice, but each time fell back down. I could n't find the strength. With the last fibre of strength I had left, I reached out my hand to the obelisk, and I begged to it. 
 
 `` Murthy, pleasss! Thpare me!''. 
 
 As I finished pleading for quarter, a scorpion arose from the sand. But that was impossible, nothing lived out here, man or beast. Just another illusion. I tried to reach for the scorpion, to see if it were truly there, but before I could so much as raise my hand from this cursed sand, everything faded to black. I embraced the blackness eagerly, it was much more welcoming than the beige. 
 

"," Emulate Morrison's lyrical prose, exploring themes of identity, race, and humanity with depth and nuance.","In the arid expanse of the desert, where the scorching sun cast long, unforgiving shadows, I emerged from the netherworld of sand. The barren landscape stretched before me, an unforgiving canvas upon which I was etched as a transient visitor. The sand, soft as powder, enveloped me, burying me deep within its velvety embrace. I felt as if I were suspended in an eternal slumber, my consciousness adrift in a sea of oblivion.

Slowly, I raised my head from the ground, my sand-laden eyes searching for a glimmer of respite. The sand met my gaze, offering nothing but its cold, unforgiving beauty. I turned my head to the left, hoping against hope for a glimpse of something beyond the barrenness. Alas, the sea of beige stretched before me, unbroken and unrelenting. The realization dawned upon me that I was trapped, buried in the suffocating sand, my fate sealed.

The memories of the sandstorm resurfaced, vivid and terrifying. The merciless wind had carried away my companions, leaving me as the sole survivor. Five souls, once vibrant and full of life, now forever lost to the merciless embrace of the desert. The sand was static, devoid of any movement or semblance of life. It was as if I had been transported to a tomb, a silent testament to the fleeting nature of existence.

With a desperate cry, I uttered the words, ""Where is the water?"" My tongue, parched and swollen, struggled to articulate the question. I searched for my canteen, my only source of sustenance in this barren wasteland. It was there, but empty, mocking me with the promise of hydration. I felt a wave of despair wash over me, knowing that I had consumed my last drop of water.

Yet, I refused to surrender. I knew that I had to make it, even if it meant sacrificing my remaining strength. Taking a deep breath, I dug myself out from beneath the sand, my body aching and depleted. I limped towards the horizon, my mind consumed by the singular goal of reaching salvation.

But fate had a cruel twist in store for me. As I ran, my legs gave way, and I tumbled down the dune, my body wracked with pain. The sand engulfed me once more, and I felt as if I was being consumed by the abyss. Hallucinations danced before my eyes, the desert transforming into a vibrant tapestry of colors and dreams. Yet, I remained steadfast, my spirit unbroken.

In that moment, I was a prisoner to the sand, a victim to the merciless cruelty of the desert. But I was also a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit, a symbol of resilience in the face of adversity. I was a child of the desert, born and bred in its unforgiving embrace. And I knew, that despite the odds, I would survive, my spirit etched forever in the annals of time."
"`` And it was done. 6 days of the 7 total too, you owe me 10 omnipopence `` 
 
 God leant on the table, surveying her creation. Lucifer stood beside her. The blue glow illuminating both of their faces was fresh and lively. God looked pleased with herself. The light from the world threw Lucifer's masculine features into little confused shadowy contortions. 
 
 `` It does n't look right...'' Lucifer said slowly. 
 
 `` What do you mean?'' God answered. 
 
 `` Well, you see that bit there, what's it doing?'' Lucifer remarked. 
 
 `` There's always spare bits ya know? Ya just throw them in, hope for the best'' 
 
 ``... Yes, but that looks like it's more of a danger than anything. What if it explodes and kills them?'' 
 
 God squinted closely at Steve. Moving very slowly she temporally reached through Steve's belly and poked the appendix. Steve yelled, keeled over, and stopped moving. God quickly grabbed another one from the box, jammed it together and quickly put it in. 
 
 `` Look, it's fine'' God said, hurriedly pushing the box under the table. `` This one's called Adam.'' 
 
 Adam plodded through the garden of the world looking slightly dazed, but happy to be alive. He gently nudged Steve's corpse with his foot. 
 
 Lucifer looked over. `` Was n't there supposed to be another one?'' 
 
 God calmly removed the box from under the table and reached inside. Pushing some bits together he made the first woman. God threw her in. 
 
 `` Perhaps you should have been more careful... she's got scorch marks from the atmosphere and a concussion now. She looks like she'll be a right bitch'' said Lucifer. 
 
 `` It will be fine'', God said through slightly gritted teeth, `` there's some bits leftover to make one last one if we need to.'' 
 
 Lucifer nodded, pleased. They watched the creations play about the garden for a short while. 
 
 `` Lilith just ate some of Steve's corpse...'' whispered God under her breath. 
 
 `` Yeah...'' replied Lucifer, in similar tones. 
 
 `` Perhaps we should...? Oh she's doing some other stuff now? Wait, what, no...'' 
 
 `` Yes, No. Get rid of her. For the best.'' 
 
 God flicked Lilith till she left, shaking her fist. 
 
 `` So that other one you mentioned...?'' 
 
 `` Yes, I'll grab her bits'' 
 
 God smoothed the human in her palms into almost life. There was something missing. 
 
 `` There's a part missing'' mused God. 
 
 `` Well, what are we supposed to do?'' said Lucifer. 
 
 `` I do n't know, this is the first time I've done this thing! I had to create IKEA to bloody make it!'' 
 
 `` Do n't get snappy! You always get uppity with this sort of thing. First it was the sofa, then the kitchen cabinets and now this'' riled Lucider, angrily. 
 
 God glared. `` This is my house'' she monotoned, `` do n't test me.'' 
 
 Lucifer was silent. Their relationship was strenuous, at best. Lucifer was a servant to God, but God treated him like a son with all the slack she cut him. They were in the angelic puberty stages, to put it bluntly, and it was currently hell for both of them. Things were confusing, and neither of them knew what to do about it. They were deciding to keep it under the table. 
 
 `` If... if we take something from Adam we can probably make it work... like jumping a car or something'' Lucifer said eventually. 
 
 There was silence. Both of them waited. 
 
 God eventually spoke. `` That's not a bad idea... A rib might do.'' 
 
 `` What about the penis bone?'' Lucifer replied. 
 
 `` Also a good idea, I'll make do with the erections somehow I guess.'' 
 
 God reached into the bubble, again. Adam having learnt the smallest amount of language and having just heard the most recent conversation was running away with gusto. Steve's skull was smiling at him. 
 
 `` Wait, just wait and, oh- dammit I just broke the thing that made vitamin C'', God complained. Holding Adam, she twiddled her proverbial fingers and nudged the bone out. Pulling her hands from the azure sphere she slowly melded the bone into her newest child. 
 
 `` Let's... name her in honour of Steve'' said Lucifer jokingly. 
 
 `` Good idea! Eve! I like it!'' God yelled triumphantly. She placed Eve carefully in. Lucifer looked shell shocked. 
 
 Adam looked at Eve nervously. He licked his lips, then spoke, carefully. 
 
 `` أنا آسف جدا ولكن قضيبي قليلا كسرت الآن، ولكن في نهاية المطاف ، وكنت أتساءل ، ما إذا كنت ترغب في ضجة وراء ذلك الأدغال ؟'' 
 
 Eve laughed. 
 
 `` أوه ، سخيفة'' 

", Embrace the drama and over-the-top personality of a reality TV star.,"OMGOMGOMG, you guys, we totally finished the creation of Adam and Eve. I know, right? It was a total whirlwind of drama and a real pain in the ass, but I'm all about that divine drama, baby.

So, we started with the first man, Adam. You know, the one who looks like a scrawny blonde and has a gut that could hold a bowling ball. We had to wrestle with that appendix for a good hour before we finally got it in. It was like a scene from a movie, except with more poo and less Brad Pitt.

But we didn't stop there, my dear friend. We also created Eve, the first woman, complete with scorch marks from the atmosphere and a concussion. I'm telling you, she's not gonna be a very happy camper. But what can you do? You can't always get what you want in this crazy world.

And you know what? It's not even over yet. We've still got a few bits leftover, so I'm not afraid to say that we're gonna be making one last creation. I'm thinking a green-haired devil with a wicked sense of style. Stay tuned, folks, this is not over."
"I remember vividly the day that it happened. I was driving through a nasty storm in a dense forest, when suddenly a bright light flashed through my windscreen! I was blinded! I lost control of the steering and knew it was the end, and for some unknown reason I shouted “ Jesus take the wheel! ” I don ’ t know why I said what I said, but maybe it saved me in a way.

But, I couldn ’ t have. The engine was still running, and I would have remembered! I thought, Maybe I should get some sleep before I DO crash. I turned to the driver ’ s seat to turn the ignition off. But then the true horror revealed its self! The Devil himself was sitting in the driver ’ s seat! 
 
 
 After a good solid minute of screaming and trying to get out of the car, he said, “ Will you stop that now!? ” The realisation came to me that I wouldn ’ t be getting out of the car any time soon. So I looked over. He was also looking at me. He had two black horns sticking out of his red head. They were rather sharp. His teeth as yellow as a banana! His dark red hand with sharp purple finger nails where resting on the steering wheel. “ Wha… What… do you want? ” 
 
 
 “ I want YOUR services! ” The devil smirked. “ If you accept you can go on your merry way. If you so choose not to… Well let ’ s just say you won ’ t be making it out of this forest tonight. ” Just then an image flew into my mind. It was of a body. My body! It was in a lake, the entrails everywhere! It scared me more than it should have.

"There is really no rational explanation for the events I am about to relate to you. I truly wish there was, but there is not. So, here we go. 
 
 I was standing at the intersection of 5th and Main, awaiting my turn to cross. I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a woman. She was quite lovely and pushing a baby carriage. What worried me was that she was attempting to cross against the light. 
 
 There was heavy traffic and I immediately realized she was directly in the path of an oncoming vehicle which was moving at a tremendous rate of speed. There was absolutely *zero* chance she would escape without being hit. 
 
 I decided *not* to allow it to happen. It was an easy decision on my part. I did n't *want* it to happen, therefore it would not. It was just that simple. 
 
 One moment the vehicle was bearing down on her and the baby carriage, the next moment it was past her. No harm done. I know it is said that two objects can not occupy the same space at the same time, but today they did. Thankfully, the laws of physics took a very brief and suspiciously well-timed vacation. 
 
 I did n't mind a bit.
"," Adopt the macabre and eloquent style of Poe, with a focus on the Gothic and the mysterious.","The night, a tomb of shadows, cast the intersection of 5th and Main in an abyss of silence. I stood there, an unwilling participant in the macabre dance of fate. A woman, ethereal as the moon's reflection, pushed her baby carriage against the grain of the light. The devil danced in her back, plotting to ensnare her in the maw of oblivion.

As I surveyed the scene before me, I felt the hairs on my neck prickle. The traffic roared like a hungry beast, barreling towards her like a freight train out of control. There was no escape, no chance of survival. Yet, I stood there, unmoved, unwilling to allow the tragedy to unfold.

In a split second, the wind snatched the woman and her carriage away, carried them on its wicked wings towards the abyss. The vehicle roared past, a phantom of death, leaving behind the scent of destruction. I watched, my heart suspended in time, as the laws of physics danced in harmony, suspending the impossible for a fleeting moment.

No remorse consumed me. I had acted, not out of self-preservation or compassion, but out of a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of all things. In that moment, I was the master of fate, the weaver of destiny. And I did not mind."
"I know every curve of her face, the scent of her skin, the softness of her hair. 
 
 I know the sound of her voice. I know the way she laughs -- a bubbly, musical giggling, with the occasional undignified snort. It's the most wonderful sound in the world, to me. 
 
 I'm infinitely familiar with the sound of her screaming her throat raw. 
 
 This time around, I'm driving. We just bought this minivan a few weeks ago. We just had twins -- it was time to upgrade to a family car. At the dealership she'd told me, jokingly, that I'd be the one to drive them to soccer, because there was no way she was going to turn into one of those suburban soccer moms. 
 
 The twins are both in the back, in their matching carseats. I keep glancing at them in the rearview mirror. They're so tiny. So wonderful. I ca n't help but smile -- 
 
 I do n't see the semi running the red light as we cross through the intersection. 
 
 It hits us -- a terrible, bone-jarring impact on the passenger side. The airbags burst out. My wife screams, once, then gasps, coughs, and goes silent. I look at her, and regret it. 
 
 Blood. So much. Too much. Glass and twisted metal, tearing flesh -- 
 
 The twins are wailing in the back. I can barely hear them over the throbbing of my heart. 
 
 I reach out to her, try to wipe the blood from her face. Her eyes focus on me for a moment, then grow unfocused. I know, somehow, that it's over. She's gone. 
 
 `` No, no, no...'' I moan. `` No...'' 
 
 And then I wake up. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I spent a few minutes, trembling with adrenaline, focusing on my breathing and trying to slow my heartbeat. 
 
 Then I sat up, grabbed the journal from the bedside table, and started to write. 
 
 *Minivan. Hit by semi-truck on passenger side. Avoid buying minivan? * 
 
 I tried to remember the make and model. I could n't. All I could remember is that it was red -- I'd picked out the color. 
 
 Still, I'd resolved, now, to never own a minivan. Or maybe I could just avoid driving anywhere during the first few weeks after the birth of the twins. If we had twins. We might not. 
 
 I'd had other visions of us when it was n't twins. Sometimes a single daughter, or a single son. Sometimes no children at all. 
 
 My first vision had been of the two of us on our one-month anniversary -- not of our marriage, but of when we'd just started dating. It had been another car crash. I'd hit a patch of ice, skidded, hit a tree. She'd died on the way to the hospital. 
 
 I knew the place. I knew to avoid it, now, when driving at night during the winter. I'd never had that exact vision again. 
 
 But I had others. 
 
 I sighed, and flipped back through the pages of my journal. 
 
 It was a macabre piece of work, listing all the myriad ways I'd seen my soulmate die, and all the ways I hoped to avoid it. 
 
 Avoid a certain bridge at night. Do n't take her surfing when the water's rough. Do n't drag her on that road-trip your friends may-or-may-not eventually suggest, driving up to Napa for some wine-tasting thing, when it's going to be rainy out. Double, triple, quadruple check that her medication is packed when you head out for a camping trip in the middle of nowhere -- or perhaps just do n't go camping. 
 
 So many things I knew not to do -- and there was always one more. 
 
 I closed the book and glanced at the clock. It was 2:27 AM. 
 
 I flopped back down and closed my eyes. 
 
 The alarm woke me up at 6:30. I could n't remember any further dreams, that night. 
 
 Maybe that was a good sign. More likely not. I tried not to get my hopes up too much. 
 
 -- - 
 
 The visions had started about a year ago. 
 
 They'd all featured the same woman, with the same dark brown hair, gorgeous hazel eyes and a stunning dimpled smile. 
 
 I knew, in the vision, that she was the one. The love of my life. My soulmate. 
 
 Once upon a time, I would have laughed at the idea. The concept of a soulmate was just lovey-dovey romantic nonsense, sometimes with a sprinkling of new-age silliness on top. 
 
 I did n't think that way any more. I still did n't know whether souls actually existed -- but I knew that, if they did, mine and hers were two parts of a whole. Two jigsaw pieces, perfectly fitted together. 
 
 She was my other half. I loved her. 
 
 Or I would. 
 
 I still had n't met her. I knew I would, sometime in the near future. She'd been in her mid-twenties or so in the first vision, and I thought I'd been around the same age. 
 
 I was twenty-four, now. 
 
 I had n't bothered dating anyone since the visions started. There'd be no point, until I found her. I had a profile on a few sites, in case we met that way, but no luck so far. 
 
 But I was certain that I'd meet her -- just as I was certain that I'd lose her, all too soon, if I could n't figure out how to stop it. How to avoid all the possible events that led to an early grave. 
 
 Sometimes I wondered if I'd have these visions forever. She was going to die eventually. Maybe the only way they'd stop is if I'd be the one to die first. 
 
 Or maybe I'd reach a point where I was okay with letting things progress on their own, for a while. If I had a vision of her dying in her sleep at the age of ninety-two, say. I would n't enjoy watching her die, night after night -- but that would n't be so bad. We'd have a life together. We'd have some number of children -- or maybe we would n't have any at all, but either way, I knew we'd be happy together. We might fight, sometimes, but we'd always make up. 
 
 I knew it. I knew *her*. 
 
 I knew that, when I met her at last, the hole in my heart that I'd never known was there before my visions would be filled. 
 
 All I had to do was figure out how to make it last. 
 
 -- - 
 
 I was rapidly losing hope. 
 
 Night after night after night, I dreamed of another death. Sometimes it'd be the same death a few times in a row -- I'd had a week of watching her die of some terrible infection while I tried desperately to figure what had happened based off the details of the vision, and how to stop it. I knew, now, to avoid a certain lake, where a certain sort of amoeba lived that could cause brain infections. 
 
 I knew to avoid many things. But there was always something else. Always another horrible way to lose her, all too soon. 
 
 It was Saturday. I dragged myself out of bed, got dressed, grabbed my laptop, and headed to the local coffee shop. I had a project to work on, for work. I had wi-fi at home, but I wanted some horrendously sweet frozen coffee beverage while I worked. 
 
 As I walked in the door, I saw her. 
 
 I knew her instantly. How could I not? Even if I'd never started having the visions, I liked to think that, somehow, we'd have recognized each other. Love at first sight, followed by a near-perfect romance and a beautiful marriage. 
 
 She was just ahead of me in line. I could barely think. I managed to stammer out my usual order when it was my turn. 
 
 My mouth was dry. What could I say to her? What was I supposed to say? 
 
 She got her drink, sat down at a little table by the window, and pulled a book out of her purse. I recognized it. It was one of my favorites. 
 
 The barista set my drink on the counter. I took it, and went to find my own table -- 
 
 `` Hey,'' said the woman, as I passed her. She closed her book, and smiled. `` Wan na join me?'' 
 
 I could sit down. I could start a conversation. There was a topic handy -- the book she was reading. We'd click, straight away -- we'd probably talk for hours, and have another date scheduled for next weekend. 
 
 And then the clock would start ticking. 
 
 I did n't know how to stop it -- only to push it back a bit -- 
 
 But no, I realized. I did know how to stop it -- to stop all of this. 
 
 In almost every vision I had, I'd had some role in her death. 
 
 I'd been the one driving the car when we had the accident. I'd been the one who wanted to teach her how to surf. I'd been the one who'd wanted to go to that lake. 
 
 And even in the cases where things were n't so clear-cut, I knew that, if we had n't been together, her life would have certainly gone in a different direction. 
 
 Perhaps a better one. Perhaps a *longer* one. 
 
 `` Sorry,'' I said, shrugging. `` Kind of busy.'' 
 
 I passed by, sat down, and stared steadily at my laptop screen. I did n't dare to look up for nearly an hour. 
 
 By that time, she was gone. 
 
 I swallowed, then tried to force my attention back to my computer. 
 
 It was better this way. 
 
 I'd let the woman who would have been the love of my life pass me by. 
 
 But now I would n't have to watch her die. 
 
 No matter what happened -- I could believe that she was alive. Safe. Maybe happy with someone else. She deserved to be happy. She deserved to live. 
 
 And even as I walked around with a her-shaped hole in my heart, I thought, as long as I could believe she was out there, somewhere, I could live with that. 
 
 I finished my now-melty drink, shut my laptop, and headed back home. 
 
 -- - 
 
 That night, I had no visions. No dreams. Nothing. 
 
 I slept peacefully, and when I woke up to sunshine and birdsong, I wept.
"," Style the text after a Victorian detective story, including intricate plots, deductive reasoning, and a foggy London setting.","The fog draped London in a shroud that evening, weaving mist through the streets and obscuring even the brightest of stars. The scent of coal smoke and damp earth hung heavy in the air, a symphony of scents that permeated the city's veins. In the dim glow of a gas lamp, Detective William Davies sat hunched over a worn leather journal, its pages filled with intricate details of a case that had consumed him.

The case began with a simple yet perplexing complaint: a woman had been brutally murdered in her own home, and the perpetrator remained at large. As he dug deeper, Davies discovered a web of secrets and deceit that intertwined the lives of the victim and her family.

A pivotal moment in the investigation occurred when Davies found a discarded cigarette butt near the crime scene, its contents analyzed revealing the presence of a rare and potent poison. Armed with this newfound evidence, he meticulously pieced together the events leading up to the tragedy, meticulously retracing the victim's steps and analyzing the motives of those who had come into contact with her.

Through deductive reasoning and meticulous observation, Davies unraveled the intricate plot and identified the killer. It was a complex case, one that required patience, determination, and a sharp mind. With the case closed, Davies sat back and watched the fog dissipate, revealing the city bathed in the soft glow of the moon.

The mystery was over, but the scars it left behind remained. Davies knew that the victim would never be forgotten, and he vowed to continue his work, ensuring that such tragedy would not befall others."

 `` Sweet. Let's go'', I replied.

"I sat in the small, uncomfortable plane. The erratic beating of my heart was no less peaceful than the turbulent winds outside. Desperate times called for desperate measures. 
 
 The modern weapons of war were tactical and humanitarian in nature. A half-century old rifle was brutally effective, clunky and inhumane. All militaries were required to keep their firearms current to within ten years to avoid unnecessary suffering. Modern guns, bombs and planes, like the one I was in had their advantages not in power but in range, reliability and stealth.

"," Adopt the optimistic and domestic tone of a 1950s housewife, full of post-war idealism.","The aroma of fresh bread and the sweet scent of honeysuckle filled my senses as I sat in my cozy kitchen, surrounded by the warmth of my family. The post-war era was a time of boundless optimism and boundless possibilities. As I gazed at the gleaming chrome on my new refrigerator, I felt a sense of pride in the strides we had made as a nation.

The modern weapons of war were a testament to human ingenuity and the desire for peace. While they were powerful tools, their primary purpose was to protect our freedom and deter aggression. The guns, bombs, and planes of that era were far from perfect, but they were the best that humanity had to offer at the time.

As I stared at the retreating enemy aircraft, I felt a mix of anticipation and dread. I knew that I was about to embark on a journey that would change me forever. With a mixture of fear and determination, I gripped the rock tied to the end of the wooden beam and prepared for the unimaginable.

The feeling of being suspended between life and death was terrifying. I knew that I was at the mercy of fate, and there was nothing I could do to change the outcome. As I watched the enemy soldiers scramble for cover, I felt a sense of compassion for their plight. But I understood that war was a necessary evil, and I had to do my part to protect my country."
"Jesse brushed the bangs from her eyes, letting the cold sunlight dance across her mousey face. 
 
 She wrapped her coat a little tighter around her small frame and looked out across the highlands. It was so quiet here, so desolate. She liked the grey skies and the green earth, and the distant sound of the sea crashing against the rocks set her at ease. She walked down the slope towards a little cottage on the valley. 
 
 She counted her footfalls across the stout grass. One, two, three... This is when she started to get the lump in her throat. The adrenaline, the second thoughts, the stage fright. She kept her eyes focused on the cottage. She'd come too far to turn back now. 
 
 Only she could. That's what tugged her backwards from within. That's what slowed her steps and made her boots heavy. But her blood kept pumping and her adrenaline pushed her headlong towards the cottage door, hand wrapped tight around the handle of the knife. Her heart had split in two and the momentum carried her down the hill to one more victim's doorstep. 
 
 Images of blood tried to force their way into Jesse's head. She started to sweat. She pushed the images aside. Sounds of labored breathing and feeble gasps for air echoed in her ears, and Jesse forced them out. She could feel her fingertips tingle as she closed the last few yards towards the door. And inside she screamed. 
 
 With a creak the cottage door opened. Jesse's heart stopped. The wispy white hair and grizzled leathery face of an old man peeked round the equally worn door. His deep-set eyes searched her warily. Pipe smoke weaved its way up his face and round his ears. He looked at her and said nothing. 
 
 Jesse stood stone-still just a yard and a half from the door, damp hands tightening and loosening on the knife handle. She watched him with terrified eyes. 
 
 `` What're ye dain out ere?'' His voice was thick and heavy like whisky and smoke. 
 
 Jesse said nothing. 
 
 `` Come inside,'en.'' The man pushed the door open wide and reluctantly beckoned her in. Jesse stood for a moment longer. She stepped through the doorway. 
 
 The cottage was warm and smelled of birch fire and tobacco. Jesse looked around the place, eyes sharp as the blade in her pocket- The man offered to take her coat. Jesse swallowed. She released the knife and pulled her hands from her coat. The man hung it up gently beside the door and padded over to the small wooden table in the kitchen. Jesse watched him go and felt herself shake. Her eyes flicked back to her coat. No good. 
 
 The man poured a mug of tea for Jesse, the steam rising up about his unblinking face. Jesse walked timidly to the table and sat down in a creaky wooden chair. Probably made it himself, she thought. He handed her the mug and relit his pipe, its ember glow reflected in his old dark eyes. 
 
 `` Thenk ye.'' Jesse felt the tiny words squeeze out of her throat and disappear into the cottage. She avoided his eyes, searching. There was a hunting rifle in the corner beside the fireplace. Too slow. A small knife beside the basin, but he stood between her and the blade. Her eyes darted frantically around the room, looking for a tool. All the while the old man's eyes regarded her slowly and with curiosity. 
 
 There. Next to the door. The knife would be too slow to dig from her coat, but beside it -- 
 
 `` What're ye dain out ere?'' he repeated. 
 
 Jesse looked to the man, her brow furrowed beneath her brownish bangs. `` A bit lost...'' she whispered. 
 
 The old man nodded slowly and pulled on his pipe. She smoke made the air thick, revealing sunbeams through dirty glass windows. Jesse sipped her tea and tasted nothing. `` Kin ye show me th' way?'' she asked, chancing a look into his eyes. She could see it now. He was coming. 
 
 The old man treaded slowly past the doorway to a window on the south end. He looked out across the hills and valleys. `` That's South.'ead down that strath til et becomes a glen. That'll take ye to the main road.'' 
 
 She was already at the door. Jesse's hand wrapped tight around the cracked wooden handle of a shovel resting by the door. She was across the floor in a heartbeat. 
 
 The old man turned to her steadily, unable to blink before the rusted metal blade came down on him. His pipe clattered to the floor before the rest of him, and the blood that seeped from his head extinguished the embers spilled to the floor. 
 
 Jesse's chest heaved as she stood over him. Her lips quivered, her heart ran rampant in her chest. The shovel slipped from her weak fingertips, and she soon followed after as the weakness spread to her knees. 
 
 As she sat in a heap on the floor and trembled beside the crushed body of the old man, she smiled through her tears as death swept over him and carried him away into nothingness.
"," Use the savvy and sharp language of a street-smart urbanite, with slang and a quick wit.","Jesse brushed the bangs from her eyes, the cold sunlight slicing through her mousey face. It was dead quiet out there, so desolate. The grey skies and the green earth stretched endlessly before her, and the distant roar of the waves crashing against the rocks set her at ease. She walked down the slope, her mind wandering back to the city, but her feet pointed towards a lonely cottage in the valley below.

She counted her footfalls, one, two, three... The adrenaline started to creep up her throat, the second thoughts, the stage fright. She kept her eyes focused on the cottage. She'd come too far to turn back now. Only she could. That's what tugged her backwards from within, that's what slowed her steps and made her boots heavy.

Jesse said nothing.

""Come inside,"" he said, pushing the door open wide.

Jesse took a step back, her fear gripping her. She knew what she had to do. She had come too far to back down now. Drawing her strength from within, she charged at the old man, the knife glinting in her hand."
"-Harry, would you please shut up I can hardly hear myself think. 
 
 -No one wants to hear you think Shane, we hear enough of that as it is. 
 
 
 Thomas Pearson, 27, ex-lawyer, was an unremarkable man in many ways. Thomas had worked hard at jt, carefully, piecing together a life of inoffensive incident and innocuous intent. And then he's started dreaming. 
 
 
 -Would you keep your dirty projections OFF this mans subconscious please, this is a bar not yet another therapist's office. That goes for you Elaine, we do n't need another host crying at the sight of a frying pan! 
 
 
 Telepaths are not good at keeping themselves to themselves, pretty much by definition. If you can project your thoughts, its partly because you're sure that your thoughts are worth projecting. 
 
 -Hey bartender, bartender! What's a man got to do to get a drink in this place. 
 
 
 -just be patient Christ, this guys already got us in his head no wonder hes not in a hurry to serve us drinks. Learn to wait like normal people do. 
 
 Y'know, after a lifetime of being able to capture someone's attention without saying a word, ill admit both that no, I am not good at waiting for some slob who should n't be with a job to notice me! 
 
 -Christ, its not his jo- anyway- 
 
 -AND ill admit that the service here is god awful. Call this a bar for telepaths? Bar for schmucks more like. 
 
 
 No one was quite sure who came up with the idea, but in a rare case of agreement within the telepath'community' ( about as well bonded as feral cats in a box ) everyone thought a telepath bar was genius: chance to slip away from watchful spouses without'leaving' the house, bitch about normal people stubbornly'misunderstanding' your projections... Of course, while no one would say it, it was good to meet with like-minded, people. Unlike minded people ( calling them lesser-minder was... Old fashioned ) were trying. Oh and at this bar, no hangovers. 
 
 
 -Ah finally! Can I get a beer, two beers, three beers- hey I thought we were n't teleling in here, speak with your mouths numbskulls! 
 
 
 Thomas, currently behind the bar inside his own mind, looked a wreck. 
 
 
 -three beer? 
 
 
 -sigh, no, six. I'm not going to pay attention next time FYI. Yes Janet that includes you. 
 
 
 Every other night they'd crowd themselves into someone's brain, gatecrashing their hipothomus and serving from their cervix. It used to be a constant rotation of heads/bars, way of keeping it fresh and hush hush - party in Clintons brain VIP Only - until the sheen of travelling wore, off. And, also, they one brain they particularly liked. 
 
 
 - Would you get your elbows out of my childhood memories please? Thank you! 
 
 
 Because it was empty. 
 
 
 Thomas Pearson, 27, ex-lawyer, was currently unsure of where he was. Part of him was a compliant and absent bartender, and was aware of a racket in his brain, though trying to hear it was like trying to scratch the itch of a missing limb, or bite your own ear. Some other part of him, some scared and lost part, was trying to ring alarm bells. He was sleep walking. 
 
 
 - Did you lot hear anything? 
 
 
 - only your drunken ramblings, could you turn the trauma down a little- 
 
 
 - No seriously, there's this- 
 
 
 The bar shook. Thomas dozed upright behind the bar. 
 
 
 -This is a psychological projection, a shared abstract space. A metaphor. Metaphors do n't shake. 
 
 
 -This one just did. 
 
 
 -Does anyone know where are? Like, are are? 
 
 No one did. That kind of detail was for people with bodies to worry about. The bar shook again. 
 
 Shane was the first to pull himself together. 
 
 
 - I know who knows. 
 
 
 Elbowing his way through the wide-eyed and suddenly unpleasantly sober crowd, he grabbed Thomas by the collar, pulling him over the counter. 
 
 
 -What is this? Where are we?! 
 
 
 - Shane stop 
 - Where. Are. We 
 
 
 Thomas' eyes were baleful as only a pure creation of abused misery could be. 
 
 - Sleep. We- Sleep. 
 
 
 With Shane staring at hin uncomprehending, Thomas slumped forward. The bar, and its contents, slumped forward. 
 
 
 - Everybody out! Elaine cried, holding onto a repressed thought, You do n't have to go home but you can't- 
 
 
 - We cant leave! A voice rose through the clamour, too late to stop most from disappearing out. 
 
 
 - Why not? 
 
 
 - Because he'll die! Or be locked into his body forever, you cant fall asleep in your head and be right again. 
 
 
 A few abstract but perfectly deadly bottles whizzed past. 
 
 
 - I do n't know! Wake him up? 
 
 
 
 Thomas Pearson, 27, ex-lawyer, awoke with the sun in his face and the clearest head he's ever had. He heard a polite cough. A doctor loomed over him. He was in hospital! How nice. 
 
 
 `` How are you feeling Mr Pearson? You've had a very busy night.'' 
 
 
 The explanation was quite confusing and blurry, something about sleepwalking into a busy road yet miraculously dodging all the cars?, but the main thing was that he was just fine and only needed some rest. 
 
 
 More confusing was the trio of strangely dressed visitors who he'd never seen before and yet somehow knew very well, who came to let him know that they were sorry ( thank you? ) and that they'd managed to get him his old job back- his boss having a change of mind and realising that Thomas' recent lacklustre performance was a blip to be overlooked. A mere lack of proper sleep. 
 
 
 -I swear I'm never letting you steer again. 
 
 
 - hes alive and well is n't he? That's the main thing. 
 
 
 - that cab almost- 
 
 
 - only almost! 
 
 
 - stop it you two, all ill say is that of all the places he could have wandered to, how did he sleep walk into the road? 
 
 
 - Does it matter now? 
 
 
 - No I guess not. 
 
 
 - Drink? 
 
 
 - Drink
"," Use the lyrical and storytelling style of a medieval bard, full of adventure and heroism.","In the realm of whispers and thoughts, where echoes dance through the air, there lived an unremarkable man named Thomas Pearson, whose heart had been touched by a mysterious dream. Like a siren's song, his intrusive thoughts cast a spell upon those who crossed his path, leaving an indelible mark upon their minds.

One fateful evening, as he sat in a smoky tavern, Thomas found himself entangled in a conversation that would forever alter his destiny. As he shared his dream, the voices of his fellow telepaths echoed through the establishment, each one projecting their own fears, desires, and aspirations. Telepathy, it seemed, was a gift that not only allowed for the sharing of thoughts but also the invasion of others' minds.

No sooner had the dream faded than Thomas was consumed by the intoxicating rhythm of the tavern, its atmosphere thick with the scent of ale and smoke. The bartender, a man of mysterious ways and unwavering patience, offered him a drink, but Thomas's impatience knew no bounds. He demanded a swift concoction, his voice dripping with disdain.

The bartender, a stoic figure with a weary smile, responded with a sigh, ""Just be patient, my dear Thomas. Your drink will be ready soon."" But Thomas's impatience knew no bounds. He stormed out of the tavern, leaving behind the bewildered patrons and the bartender's bewildered sigh.

Yet, as he walked away, Thomas couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. It was as if the voices of his intrusive thoughts had followed him, mocking his misery. He realized that telepathy was a double-edged sword, one that could bring joy and connection, but also the potential for invasion and destruction.

In the aftermath of his meltdown, Thomas returned to the tavern, his anger fading into resignation. He found solace in the company of other telepaths, each one sharing their unique experiences and perspectives. They danced, sang, and laughed, their voices harmonizing with the spirit of the tavern.

And so, the tale of Thomas Pearson, the ex-lawyer who dreamed of a telepath bar, became a legend whispered in the ears of those who believed in the transformative power of the human mind."
"She arose to a sparkling light of great warmth, but this did not feel like her home planet. As she gazed at the lush green surroundings, her stomach began to pang for intake. She began to wander through the life surrounding her, she saw fellow creatures scampering on the ground, the ball of warmth up above illuminating the green geometrical fronds and petals. 
 
 Fundamentally these lifeforms were similar to her home planets'. She noticed some plants reached for her, after carefully inspecting the leaves through smell, sight, and touch, she then nibbled on one to test its agreeability. The plant was palatable and had no sourness to it. 
 
 After munching a handful of leaves, she set off towards the bubbling sound of life nearby. As she pawed through the forest, she came upon a stream, she noticed a small creature with its mouth in the stream. She imitated the creature, seeing that it was n't dissimilar from her self. Refreshed by the water, she then began to set eyes on the creature, recognizing it as prey for if it had drank a life source, than it must be a life source. 
 
 Later on as she slept under the millions of shining lights in the sky, she felt the teeth of a creature sink into her skin, and the next morning she awoke, this time on a new planet.
", Use technical jargon and a sense of urgency typical of a cyber security expert.,"The galactic cosmic ballet danced in front of her, the emerald tapestry of the alien planet unfolded beneath her gaze. Despite the alien sun casting a warm glow, she felt an unsettling sense of displacement. The verdant landscapes mirrored her home planets, yet the flora whispered secrets she couldn't comprehend.

Her stomach grumbled with hunger, prompting her to forage. As she ventured through the emerald labyrinth of the forest, she encountered creatures scurrying through the undergrowth. Their slender limbs danced with the rhythm of the alien sun, their delicate fronds reaching towards her. She cautiously tasted a leaf, its texture smooth against her tongue, the sweetness lingering like honey.

Following the scent of bubbling water, she stumbled upon a stream. A small creature, its mouth agape in the stream, mirrored her own reflection. She emulated its posture, quenching her thirst and recognizing the vulnerability of the unsuspecting prey. As she rested beneath the celestial tapestry of stars, she felt an icy hand clamp down upon her skin, the piercing bite leaving an indelible mark.

Waking up the next morning, she found herself on a new planet. The alien landscape stretched before her, an enigma waiting to be unraveled. The scars of her encounter with the predator remained fresh in her mind, a testament to the unforgiving nature of the universe."
"UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU 
... to stop going back in time 
 and poking Julius Caesar with plastic knives 
 HE DOES NOT LIKE IT 
 
 Barry squinted at the poster pasted on the brick wall. Uncle Sam looked a bit feral in it. His eyes were wild and red rimmed, as though the very thought of someone poking Caesar with plastic knives was keeping him up at night. 
 
 `` Kids ruin everything'', he muttered. 
 
 Some genius had invented a portable time machine twenty years or so ago. He'd uploaded his schematics to the internet and now everyone had one or could have one if they wanted to. 
 
 No one changed the future or anything. Apparently that was impossible. Anything you fucked up in the past eventually fixed itself. Barry had listened to a guy on TV explain it once. He'd said time was like silly putty. You could mold it however you wanted but the slimy stuff desired to be whole. Time wanted to be a series of fixed points. 
 
 Nothing you brought back with you stayed. Barry knew a guy who'd stolen a chest full of gold from some old pirate ship. It disappeared as soon as the guy had come back. Now that same guy had lost an eye to the pirate king and that stayed gone. Though Barry did n't think he looked that bad in an eye patch. 
 
 The problems came, then, from the machines themselves. Some people came back wrong. They carved symbols into their skin, blathering about the coming storm. Some people just died. They crossed the wrong wires when building their machine or went to the wrong time or date or any number of similar things. The streets were littered with missing posters. 
 
 The government was n't too concerned about time travel mishaps. What they were concerned about was taxes. President Kilborn had managed to pass a law which patented the time machine design several years ago. Anyone who used or downloaded the design must pay taxes. Such a thing was, of course, hard to keep track of. So the Agency was born, to collect on these debts. 
 
 Barry joined up half a dozen years ago. It was n't what he'd thought it would be. Mostly a lot of skulking. Peeping. Listening. Occasionally moments of brief terror. Tonight he was supposed to go bust a kid for unauthorized time travel. The kid had gone back to regency England and started flipping women's skirts up. Barry had listened as he told his friend over the phone that the bustles made them like turtles. A room full of turtles, he'd laughed. 
 
 Barry stuffed his hands in his pockets, waiting. His partner stumbled out of the bar, clutching a woman in either arm. 
 
 `` Phil? You forget we had a bust tonight?'' 
 
 Phil looked out blearily from under a red fedora. He'd gotten into old black and white films recently and wore a suit everywhere. He was n't alone. Most found a time period they liked and dressed that way. Powdered wigs and neon and gingham dresses. It was enough to give any man a raging headache. 
 
 `` But my dolls needed refreshment! Would you deny my dolls, Barry? Would you?'' Phil slurred. Barry realized the women were all that was holding him up. 
 
 `` Just take him home. I'll go it alone. It's just one kid'', Barry said. He walked away in disgust as Phil kept asking the girls what happened. 
 
 The kid lived a few blocks away in his parent ’ s basement. Barry had spied through the window a couple of times. He had n't seen much. Kid ate too much junk food and played VR constantly. Tonight, the windows were dark. 
 
 Barry peeked in, spotting a lone green light. The time travel device had a light like that. It flared up when in use and broke after one trip. They were n't very efficient to use or make. 
 
 Barry clutched his tazer and opened the window, wiggling in with room to spare. He usually hated his long bony frame but it did come in handy sometimes. 
 
 `` Put your hands up!'' he yelled into the darkness. 
 
 `` Oh shit!'' 
 
 `` Lights! 100 percent!'' Barry yelled. 
 
 The lights came on, near blinding him. In the middle of the room stood the kid. He was dressed. Well, Barry did n't know what he was dressed as. He wore a huge bell shaped skirt. And a corset? That bone looking thing around his waist really looked like a corset. 
 
 `` I can explain, officer'', the kid said. 
 
 Barry closed his eyes. `` How about I come back tomorrow and arrest you? You ca n't go to jail wearing bloomers, for Christ's sake. Well, you could but you would n't like it.'' 
 
 The kid bit his lip. `` I just wanted to see what it felt like. The way they moved....'' 
 
 Barry held up his hand. He left, going up the stairs past the kid's parents who never looked up from their holotv. He headed back towards the bar where he'd left Phil, wondering if there was any whisky left in the place. 

"," Model the text on a Regency romance novel, focusing on social gatherings, romantic pursuits, and the strict manners of the era.","The Regency ballrooms danced with the glow of candlelight, the scent of lavender and desperation filling the air. The clock struck eight, and the clockwork contraptions roared to life, propelling their owners back in time. In this realm of flickering shadows and powdered wigs, Barry stood, a spectator to the unfolding drama.

The social gatherings he frequented were steeped in the etiquette of the era. Ladies adorned in silks and jewels danced with grace, their eyes shimmering like the silver moon. Gentlemen, clad in suits and feathered fans, offered their unwavering attention and unwavering charm. Yet, beneath the surface, a sense of unease lurked.

The whispers carried tales of temporal mishaps and unintended consequences. Some individuals returned with altered appearances or damaged reputations, bearing the scars of their own errors. Others met their demise in a cruel twist of fate, victims of the temporal turbulence. The streets were littered with missing posters, testaments to the fragility of time and the capricious nature of fate.

Despite the risks, Barry found solace in the rhythm of the social gatherings, the fleeting moments of connection, and the bittersweet realization of the past and future. He danced with the young and vibrant, shared stories with the old and wise, and embraced the fleeting beauty of human interaction.

In this era of societal conformity and relentless change, Barry found his own rhythm, a melody echoed through the halls of time. He danced with grace, spoke with wisdom, and left his own indelible mark on the tapestry of history."
"She had gotten angry, gotten out of the car and he had driven off in the smoggy snow, leaving only the tire tracks behind. They ’ d both been angry. She ’ d even forgotten her purse in the car. Of course, she had kept her little.380 strapped to her leg under the dress. She could never pull the gun from her purse quick enough. By the time she had figured out that she was trapped in a set of walls that she couldn ’ t even see, his taillights had long vanished into the fog. She was still angry and god, how she had screamed and screamed and pounded on those walls. Cursed him, cursed everyone for them being there, even if it made no sense. 
 
 Eventually she had drawn the weapon and fired multiple times at the wall. The small bullets had ricocheted around and it had finally brought her to her senses but far, far too late. One bullet had gone through her hand, another through her side, and a third pierced her abdomen. She knew it was bad with how much she was bleeding. She screamed for help instead now before she felt her strength leaving her, sinking down to the ground to cry, hand smearing blood down the wall. She sobbed with her head hung low and cupping her side, knowing that she was just going to die in the snow. Fuck him. She wouldn ’ t have gotten out of the car if he hadn ’ t started the argument about her dress. She wouldn ’ t be dying in the snow without him coming back for her.
"," Adopt the weathered and tale-filled voice of an ancient mariner, full of sea lore.","Avast, me hearties, gather around and hear a tale of the sea that will make your blood run cold and your hair stand on end. It's a tale of a woman trapped in a snowbound tomb, her anger fueling a storm that shook the very walls of the earth.

She had been a woman of fire and passion, as fiery as the sun itself. But fate had dealt her a hand of cards that would turn her anger into a deadly weapon. The snow had fallen thick that day, smothering the world in a blanket of white. And as fate would have it, she had gotten out of her car, her anger boiling over like a pot on the stove, leaving only the tire tracks of her journey behind.

The devil was riding with her that day, his taillights disappearing into the fog like a ghost ship in the night. She was still angry, god help her, and she screamed and pounded on the walls of her prison, cursing all who had been a part of this tragedy, even if it made no sense. The walls shook with the force of her rage, but it was too late.

With a weapon she drew and fired, she unleashed her fury upon the walls, the bullets ricocheting like a storm wind. The blood flowed freely down her hand, through her side, and pierced her abdomen. But she did not despair. With a scream of pain and anguish, she cupped her side, her strength fading, and sank to the ground. The snow soaked up her tears, and the wind carried the scent of her despair.

So, my dear listener, let us remember the tale of this woman, a victim to her own anger and the cruel hand of fate. May her story serve as a warning to all, reminding us that even in the darkest of times, there is always a lesson to be learned. And so, I raise my glass to the sky, in her memory."
"The envelope was heavy. Very heavy, especially considering that it does n't cost too much to get a favorable review. Ron cut it open, and tipped out 100 dollar bills, and a bunch of pennies, taped together flat. They did n't jingle, they hit the table with a thud as hollow as Ron's promises. 
 
 He opened his laptop, and fired up a word document. He tried to start writing something, but it was all the kind of lies that made his fingernails itch. Ron was n't averse to selling a mediocre book as if it were something of quality, or postulating that the great books he read would one day replace classics on the shelves of the wise. He liked a little bit of hyperbole, flattery, a little bi of white-lie to spice up a review. It was easier to be critical of a book, which is why Ron's column was called `` High Notes,'' because he focused on the good. People liked it, people read it, and the local bookstore confirmed that he had an impact. 
 
 But he could n't justify the garbage he had read. There was no way that Ron could convince an innocent person to open that tome, to read its words, to know the author's madness the way that he did. After three hours, two joints, and a few drinks, Ron was lubricated enough that he had a wicked idea; write positively, but make it incredibly clear that the book was awful. 
 
 `` If you enjoyed Shakespeare's novels, or the brisk pace of Herman Melville's *Moby Dick*, then Scott Trifold's newest masterpiece will absolutely thrill you. 
 
 Its plot is dense like packing peanuts, and so tightly woven you'd swear it was a fishing net. The characters are well-developed like three minute wine, and their complexities make a blank piece of paper seem positively unknowable. The novel begins as many do, with something happening. Trifold, however, does not take the predictable route of either having something else happen, or explaining what's happening. Instead, he writes out the whole scene again, from the same perspective, with even more adverbs. This daring use of repetition is evident through the whole novel. Three characters named Molly appear at different points, and despite being different people, they are all described the same way, down to the spelling errors. 
 
 Trifold's disdain for the traditional rules of writing set him apart from his contemporaries, who focus on readability, or depth, but his efforts produce something much more exciting; the experience of feeling like a beginning writer. It is this critic's belief that Scott Trifold produced *The Witch's Tits* not as a novel, but as an experimental form of fiction where we see how a plot develops inside the mind of a simpleton, and it is absolutely breathtaking in how it accomplishes that. The occasional note from the fictional author to himself is heavy-handed at times, but nothing can make a sex scene- so realistic and invigorating that you'd swear it was stolen from a twelve year old's fanfic- better than a shopping list. 
 
 The book is almost certainly available for sale.

"," Recast the narrative in the style of an Arthurian legend, complete with knights, chivalry, and quests for honor.","In the midst of a tale spun from the golden fibers of legend, the hero, Ron, bore the burden of a tale spun from the pen of a madman. To him, as the bearer of ink and parchment, fell the responsibility to illuminate the path of others through the treacherous landscape of mediocre literature.

The parchment, bearing the weight of the printed word, revealed itself as a vessel brimming with treasures. The ink, flowing with the grace of a knight's sword, etched tales of deceit and injustice. With each turn of the page, the hero's resolve wavered between the temptation of embellishment and the burden of truth.

In the realm of inkwell and quill, Ron's pen danced with the fury of a dragon, weaving a narrative as intricate as a knight's knot. Yet, this tale was not one of valor and honor, but one of self-destruction and the illusion of achievement. The characters, as complex as a labyrinth, were as fleeting as a dream on a windblown night.

Yet, in the face of adversity, the hero's spirit burned brightly, refusing to be cowed by the weight of criticism. With his pen, he struck a balance between truth and illusion, weaving a tale that both entertained and enlightened.

In the aftermath of his literary triumph, the hero stood tall, knowing that his words, like the sword of a knight, had the power to shape the destiny of others. And so, the legend of Ron, the weaver of tales, lived on, inspiring generations of readers to question, critique, and ultimately, to find their own ways to illuminate the world."
"It's amazing what you can get used to. The incessant throbbing of my left thumb from when my cousin shut it in that car door when I was six. The constant sting from scraping my knees in my drive way when I was twelve. The perpetually sprained wrist from the first and last time I got drunk in college, not to mention this fucking non stop hang over. Despite not being able to taste food since I bit into that scalding hot pizza pocket in middle school or my inability to hear that well since that asshole Chad Mcmanus threw that fire cracker too close to me and my ears started ringing senior year I've pretty much grown accustomed to the constant pain and discomfort. It's funny to me how much people take for granted the ability to shake off an almost infinite onslaught of pain on a daily basis, stubbed toes, paper cuts, and the itching SWEET CHRIST THE ITCHING! Most people do n't know this but an itch is just a mild signal to your pain receptors, something brushes against your body and your pain receptors send an itching signal to your brain, scratching dislodges the irritant and you go on with your life, not me though, through some strange twist in biology the signal never stops I just itch and itch and itch ad infinitum. Yet, despite all this the human mind is resilient. The roaring waves of pain wash over me endlessly, they never fade or dull physically but, like with all things the human mind adapts, some days I can almost tune out the cacophony, I can even focus when I need to, attempt to live some semblance of a functioning life. It truly is amazing what you can get used to or, so I thought, until I met her. She was beautiful, warm, funny, kind, and above all patient. She never rushed me down a set of stairs, never hurried me over an icy side walk. When we made love it was gentle, no matter how badly we wanted to thrust madly towards sweet oblivion she understood that when it was over and the dopamine petered out the soreness and aching would remain. She made the world hurt less, but unlike pain her patience was finite. Every time I made us late, every time I could n't block out the noise of my body, every time I was afraid to try something new for fear of a bump or scratch her patient smile was chipped away until she could no longer hide the resentment in her face anymore. I was holding her back, we both knew and we both understood that it could n't continue. I'll never forget the day she left, she smiled her patient smile, looked at me, tears welling up in her kind eyes, she kissed me gently on the lips and walked out of my life. Then, it happened, like a trumpet from hell cutting through the din of my body it came, this pain in my chest unlike anything I've ever known before, both a sharp stabbing pain and low dull ache all at once. I buckled at the knees, everything I thought I knew and understood about pain was ripped away and replaced with something truly excruciating. Days went by, they turned to weeks, weeks swirled into months, into years. It never stops, sometimes I feel as if I'll never catch my breath again. I ca n't get past it, I ca n't ignore it. It's amazing what you can get used to, it's horrifying to find the thing that you will never get used to.

"I've never been a fan of fate. The idea that your destiny is pre-determined, that life is a narrow road, I've never seen the point of it. Who you marry, what friends you have, which job you choose - what's the point of life if you do n't have the freedom of choice. 
 
 Most people do n't realise that, they do n't realise that choice is an illusion and every single insignificant detail of their life has been planned out from the start. 
 
 I found that out the hard way. 
 
 When I was sixteen, I dropped out of school, decided to follow in my father's footsteps when he was younger and sell crap out of a car trunk. By the way he spoke of it, it sounded like a good idea at the time. He would buy some stock on the cheap-end and sell it to strangers for twice as much - business 101. If only I had the charisma he did. 
 
 At the time, I suppose it was lucky that I found the book in my car. When I set off, my parents felt sorry for me and packed up a box full of stuff, something to remind me of home. 
 
 Maybe the book was there the whole time - truth be told, I do n't know. But I was a quick learner and did n't ask too many questions. Potential customers, potential sellers, where to go and who to speak to - the answers were right in front of me. 
 
 For example: on July 19th I would talk to a guy called Ryan. We would make small talk and I would forget that I had a trunk full of stuff and he had my lunch money. He would check his watch and say, `` Sorry, Pal, got ta go'' and I'd say nothing, because I'd realise that I'm an idiot. 
 
 That's what the book said. I suppose the idea was to use that knowledge to adapt the situation, change how the conversation went. Strange how I saw two paths in front of me, but only one was real, but I did n't know better at the time. 
 
 Ryan came a few minutes after I opened up shop next to a local fair. The first few people walked past me, as I knew they would, but Ryan stopped when he saw something in the trunk. Now I know that he talked to me for another reason than feeling sorry for me, so I got straight down to business. 
 
 `` Hey, how you doing?'' he said. 
 
 `` Just fine, thank you. I noticed you looking at my stock, something catch your eye?'' 
 
 `` Yeah. That a vintage Walkman or one of the newer versions?'' 
 
 `` Straight from the 70's, I assure you. I can give you it for... let's say $ 35.'' 
 
 `` I'll give you $ 30, no more.'' 
 
 `` Deal.'' 
 
 Of course the notebook did n't tell me how to barter. I had to figure that part out for myself. Not that it mattered in the end, since I had n't looked at the other pages. Ryan was all over them. Either I was a good businessman or fate wanted me to make a profit.
"," Transform the essay into a series of hip-hop verses, focusing on rhythm, rhyme, and the expressive power of language to tell a story or convey a message.","(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, it's a tale of fate and choice,
A journey through life, a cosmic noise.
No destiny, no narrow road,
The power to choose, to break free from this mold.

(Chorus)
But fate's a illusion, a cruel game,
Every detail planned, it ain't the same.
I found out the hard way, sixteen and dumb,
Selling crap, feeling second to none.

(Verse 2)
I had a book, a guide in the trunk,
Filled with secrets, a way to unlock.
Potential customers, a feast for my eyes,
The book said, ""Use your knowledge and disguise.""

(Chorus)
But fate's a illusion, a cruel game,
Every detail planned, it ain't the same.
I found out the hard way, sixteen and dumb,
Selling crap, feeling second to none.

(Bridge)
The book said, ""Adapt, change the flow,
Use your creativity, watch your dough grow.""
I saw two paths, one real, one fake,
But I was blind, couldn't see straight.

(Chorus)
But fate's a illusion, a cruel game,
Every detail planned, it ain't the same.
I found out the hard way, sixteen and dumb,
Selling crap, feeling second to none.

(Outro)
So I'm here to tell you, don't be afraid,
To take control, make your own stand.
No one said life has to be so grim,
Choose your path, break free from the dim."
"`` Welcome, brother. I see that you have arrived at your final destination,'' boasted Saint Peter. 
 
 `` What about my family, friends?'' 
 
 Peter smiles and nods his head, halo shimmering as he does so. `` Let me show you something.'' 
 
 Peter takes my hand and guides me through the pristine arches. It's quiet, a peaceful calm that floats gracefully in the air. I ca n't see any other souls or angels but I know I'm not alone. 
 
 We enter a grand hall, something out of a fairytale. Gold and silver so bright that I can barely keep my eyes open. Peter leads me to a table in the center of the room. A photo album rests alone. 
 
 `` Go ahead,'' proclaimed Peter. 
 
 I slowly opened the leather bound album. The first page held a photo of a woman in a hospital bed holding a baby. I had to squint for my eyes to focus on the page. 
 
 `` And you know who that is, right?'' asked Peter. 
 
 `` This is my mother holding me when I was born.'' 
 
 I flipped through more pages, memories flooding back, reliving each and every moment of my life. Birthdays, family get-togethers, vacations. They were all here contained in this photo album. 
 
 Another page turned. `` What is this?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Ahh, yes.'' remarked Peter. His interest peaked. 
 
 The picture seemed over-exposed, too much light. It was of me and someone I could n't quite make out. We were standing close, hands clasped tight. `` Saint Peter, who is this? Where is this?'' 
 
 `` It's a funny thing. You can find little pieces of heaven everywhere, even on Earth.'' 
 
 I looked at Peter and slowly closed the album. He made the slightest gesture with his head. I turned and saw a beautiful angel in white standing close by. As I approached she began to smile. She took my hand. Tears were streaming down my face. 
 
 `` I thought I'd never see you again,'' I said. 
 
 We hug. 
 
 `` I told you to come find me when the time came.'' 
 
 I now knew that my world was complete. I held her tight as I caressed the ring on her finger. She did the same. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

", Infuse your text with the passionate and vivid imagery characteristic of Neruda's poetry.,"The celestial tapestry woven in Saint Peter's voice unfolds, each thread spun from passion and vivid imagery. The air crackles with the melody of a heart welcoming its final destination. The pristine arches archway to a realm where memories dance with the echoes of the past.

My hand, grasped gently by Peter, guides me through the ethereal arches. The silence hangs heavy, a testament to the serene tranquility that permeates the space. I am adrift in a sea of solitude, yet I sense a profound connection to the divine.

We enter a grand hall, its walls adorned with gilded and silver hues that ignite my senses. The photo album, a receptacle of memories, rests upon the table like a treasure unearthed from the depths of time. It is a testament to a life lived in love and contentment.

The pages turn, revealing a cascade of images that evoke a kaleidoscope of emotions. From the tender embrace of my mother in the hospital to the joyous moments shared with loved ones, each page unveils a precious memory. The photo album is a mirror reflecting the tapestry of my existence, a testament to the interconnectedness of all things.

As I turn the final page, an ethereal being, radiant as the sun, materializes before me. Her eyes sparkle with compassion and her smile widens, encompassing me in its embrace. The ring on her finger, a symbol of divine grace, beckons me to cherish this moment, this newfound completeness.

In this celestial dance of memories and grace, I find solace and serenity. The final destination has arrived, and with it, the fulfillment of a soul."
"I could rule the world if I wanted to. Be revered by all mankind and be looked at as a God. But I will do none of this. I will not help the world nor will I harm it. I'm not interested in that anymore, I'm not really interested in anything anymore. 
 
 Many people would say I'm selfish for thinking the way I do. Being able to help the entire world, yet I do nothing. I could tell people why I think this way, but they would n't understand. You see I know life is meaningless, I know there's no point or moral to be had. That every action is n't worth the effort. Of course others think this way, but there's a difference between thinking you know and actually knowing. I did n't always have this mind set though. The way I think is a result of the power that was bestowed upon me. One that I did not ask for, and certainly would never want. 
 
 You see when I die, I wake up as my six year old self. You would think it would be amazing. To keep re-living your life doing everything you wished you could have done, but that's not the case. You see it takes away life's meaning. Everyone else's life has meaning, or at least it does to them, and that thought is all I wish I could have. The thought that anything I do has some value. For me everyday is like being trapped in a glass jar with the oxygen slowly running out, but it never does. I can never die no matter how much I want to. 
 
 In the beginning it was different. Life would have been exciting, it would have been enjoyable. To be able to re-live life, correct all stupid things I did, to ask the love of my life out, to work harder and make myself better than I was before. I tried to learn everything I could. From the arts to engineering I wanted to learn it all. 
 
 I would eventually know how to build quantum computers or make sustainable fusion. I would know how to make the cure to cancer and the common cold. I even learned how to create worm holes and transverse entire galaxies in mere seconds. It took a while to learn this of course, I never was the sharpest tool in the box. But when you have lived billions of years you can pretty much learn anything. 
 
 Eventually I could single handedly progress all humanity millions of years ahead of what it should have been. We would land on Mars and have a colony before the 21st century. The whole world would be run by fusion plants by the year 2005. And then there was the way to prolong life, almost infinitely. That's when I made the biggest mistake of my life, to choose willingly to never die, and so I lived for billions of years in a single life. All the way til the universe was starting to end. 
 
 We tried to stop it, we tried practically everything. We even build an entire artifices galaxy just so we could try to survive, but nothing would work. It was then that I learned the truth of life. That everything comes to an end, that life is really meaningless. I then awoke, just as always as a six year old boy in my mothers arms. I looked at her face, a face I had n't seen in almost 30 billion years. This was when my life ended, at that moment. Although I still breath and have a heart beat, I am dead inside.
"," Infuse the narrative with the spirit of the 1920s, including jazz age slang, the glamour of the flapper culture, and post-war optimism.","The roaring twenties roared with the spirit of jazz, the glamour of flapper culture, and the post-war optimism that breathed life into a weary world. Yet, amidst the glitz and the glamour, there was a profound truth that resonated with a solitary soul.

The author's reflections on life and its meaning are steeped in the wisdom of a profound understanding of the fleeting nature of existence. With each breath, he acknowledges the precariousness of his position and the impossibility of leaving a tangible mark on the world. The thought of immortality, which once held promise, now appears as a curse, robbing him of the joy of living a meaningful life.

The author's journey through self-discovery began with a desire to learn, to understand the world and his place within it. He immersed himself in various fields, from the arts to engineering, seeking wisdom and inspiration. Yet, despite his accomplishments, he realized that the pursuit of knowledge alone was not enough. He sought meaning beyond the realm of intellectual pursuits, longing for a connection to others and a sense of purpose in a cosmic dance of creation.

The author's profound understanding of life's impermanence has taught him to appreciate the beauty of each moment, regardless of the circumstances. He recognizes that life is a fleeting experience, a journey through a glass jar with dwindling oxygen. The thought of never dying, while tempting, offers no solace in the face of his inability to leave a lasting impact.

The author's narrative is a testament to the fleeting nature of human existence and the importance of savoring each moment. It is a story of self-reflection, acceptance, and the pursuit of meaning in a world that is ultimately indifferent to our presence."
"`` Your what? Your heart's gon na give out? Believe me Chancellor, I'll think you'll live for a bit more. A little exercise is n't going to do you any harm. In fact, you likely need a bit more than a little.'' 
 
 `` I beg your pardon,'' the planetary governor stammered, his pasty white flesh reddening in outrage. He was silenced from speaking more at the sight of the other man's upraised hand, the fingers clenched into a fist. 
 
 `` Chancellor, pretty soon my men and women will be dying to protect yours. The least you can do is show them your gratitude.'' 
 
 `` Major Novak,'' the older man said wiping at a bit of sweat that beaded on his forehead. `` It's not that I am ungrateful for your Grave Guards coming to our world's aid, it's merely that I am a very busy man and the demands of my position require that certain individuals be seen to as soon as possible.'' 
 
 Major Tycho Novak chuckled grimly at that before opening a door and ushering the planetary governor outside. 
 
 `` Chancellor, if you're dead you do n't have to worry about those kinds of people. So it might be better for your well being if you worry about the here and now, hmm?'' 
 
 The door as it turned out opened to the balcony overlooking a broad parade ground, the grey cement covered with yellow and white lines to mark out distances and paths. Arrayed on it in neat lines were the soldiers and personnel of the Grave Guards, all dressed in their olive green coveralls and splinter camouflaged field jackets. Battle armor troopers wore their suits, forming a solid block of steel. Mechwarriors stood in front of their machines, the metal titans painted grey with black trim. Tankers stood next to their vehicles which proudly displayed their number of kills on the barrels of their guns. Overhead zoomed a squadron of six aerospace fighters, the roar of their engines deafening to the ears. 
 
 `` The Grave Guards, Chancellor, have yet to lose a defensive campaign. Twenty battlemechs, four tanks, eighty battle armor troopers and a full squadron of fighters. They are at your side though not your disposal. A mercenary commander's capital is his men and I will not be frivolous in spending the lives of the men and women I consider family. They will do whatever I ask of them, the trust between me and them absolute. We will win, I just want to make sure it costs us as little as possible in pursuit of that victory.''
"," Adopt the gritty, laconic style of a noir detective, with a dark, atmospheric tone.","The air hung thick with the scent of smoke and desperation in the dim, grimy alleyway. The only sound, besides the occasional flicker of a passing neon sign, was the low growl of the predator and the nervous scrape of the prey. Major Tycho Novak, a man of hardened resolve and weathered features, stood at the center of this uneasy standoff, his eyes cold as a starless night sky.

The planetary governor, a man of flowery words and trembling flesh, stood frozen in fear, his voice choked off. The threat of violence loomed large in the air, a tangible presence in the room. Novak's hand, a weapon in itself, rested on the hilt of his pistol, his voice dripping with honeyed menace.

""Your what, your heart's gon na give out, Chancellor? Believe me, I'll think you'll live for a bit more. A little exercise is n't going to do you any harm. In fact, you likely need a bit more than a little.""

No response. The governor's terror was evident in his pale, pasty skin and trembling hand.

""Major Novak,"" the governor pleaded, his voice dripping like a broken water pipe, ""I beg your pardon, I'm not trying to-""

No need for further words. Novak's hand shot out, his finger lightning quick, and silenced the governor's complaints.

The scene unfolded before him like a grim painting, the Grave Guards forming a backdrop to this dance of violence. Their olive green coveralls and battle armor stood in stark contrast to the grimy alleyway, a testament to their unwavering strength and unwavering resolve.

The air crackled with the scent of ozone and desperation as the soldiers, tanks, and fighters roared into action. A symphony of destruction unfolded, a dance of death enacted in the name of justice.

As the battle raged on, Novak stood unmoved, his eyes focused on the unfolding scene before him. A man of conviction and unwavering grit, he knew that this was not just a battle against the enemy but also a battle against the forces of chaos and destruction."
"It *sucks. * 
 
 I'm terrified to touch people. Before you ask, no I do not have some kind of mental illness, nor do I have OCD. It's just that I can see more than people think. How it works is that I touch the person in question and I can see their emotional background. I can see what their brain protects itself from. Their dog dying made a huge impact on them. *Whoop. * I see that kind of thing all the time waiting for my subway train. 
 
 Sure, some of them are pretty run-of-the-mill things like a pet passing away, a loved one dying, or even the occasional shady dealings with the local loan shark. After a while, it gets easier. Kind of like a filter; the redundant stuff just blurs together. 
 
 Then she came. 
 
 She was a new client who came into my office the other day requesting some kind of graphics project that `` absolutely had to be done yesterday'' and that `` money was no object, just get it done.'' After yelling at my poor secretary Charlene who, bless her heart, put up with her while I got her file all ready for our meeting. 
 
 `` Mr. Peterson will see you now. Please follow me.'' Charlene said curtly. It was painfully obvious that she was fed up with her, from the sound of her voice. 
 
 `` God, finally. I've been waiting *all day* for this.'' 
 
 After Charlene opened the door to show her in, I took a quick look at her file that her employer sent me a few hours beforehand and shifted my gaze upwards to meet hers. I would be lying if I did n't say that I was shocked. 
 
 She was *beautiful. * Absolutely gorgeous. She was around five feet, six inches. A full five inches shorter than me. She wore a grey cardigan that sufficiently showed her full breast and a nice pair of matching slacks that seemed to follow a smooth, full curve starting from her waist down to the beginning of her thighs. Trying to pull my eyes away, I shifted my eyes upward and saw her face. Her face had perfect proportions. Piercing gray eyes combined with brown hair made her upper half just as pleasing as her lower half. 
 
 I gulped: `` Hi, I'm Scott Peterson. I'll be handling your project.'' 
 
 `` Oh it's nice to meet you! I'm Julie. Julie Robson.'' 
 
 `` Thanks for coming in, Julie. Can we discuss your project?'' 
 
 `` By all means.'' 
 
 We sat down and started a healthy conversation about the project she needed to have done for her boss's convention coming up soon in the city. As we talked, I noticed that I actually liked her. Was this the same woman I heard screeching to poor Charlene just a few hours before? No it could n't be. The pearly white teeth that flashed each time she made a quick glance in my direction, the hair tied in a tight bun- 
 
 `` I'm sorry my hair's bothering me. Is it alright with you if I let it down?'' 
 
 `` Sure! I do n't mind. At all. Uhh I mean... go ahead.'' *Come on do n't screw it up. This is a beautiful woman standing three feet away from you! Divert all blood away from the other head! * Julie pulled out a pin and her hair came tumbling down. Oh God, it was like a Pantene commercial. It was almost impossible that a goddess of this caliber would be talking to me. 
 
 `` Can we continue?'' said Julie. 
 
 `` Yeah.'' 
 
 It was around ten o'clock when we finished discussing her project. Both of us were exhausted. I wanted to know when I would see her again, to enjoy her presence. I know it sounds pretty bad, but I fell pretty hard for Julie. She was perfect. 
 
 `` Are you sure we're all done here? Got all the questions you wanted to ask answered?'' I asked. 
 
 She said, `` oh, I still have a few questions. I can wait until tomorrow though. Same time, same place?'' 
 
 `` Of course. You know where I sleep.'' I pointed to my office. 
 
 She giggled. `` Oh stop. I'm sure you do n't work that hard. I am exhausted. I'll talk to you tomorrow!'' 
 
 She extended her hand for a friendly handshake. Without thinking I reached over and grabbed her hand. It was n't until her memories came flooding into me that I realized what I had done. I did n't want to ruin my perfect idea of her. 
 
 Her memories were pretty standard. The typical upper-class only child upbringing. Well-off parents who spoiled her, but restrained enough to prevent her from going rotten. Memories of high school and heartbreak. College and new experiences. Study abroad. 
 
 Then everything went dark. It was just myself. Was this the end of her memories? I heard a screaming and the sound of a news report detailing a grisly murder. Then came the sound of a scalpel cutting through flesh. The screams of someone being tortured for information... or just for the sheer pleasure of his or her captor? During this entire episode, the news report kept getting louder and louder until it all turned into a buzzing white noise that stayed in your head, like a hive of bees in your brain. 
 
 More screams. I expected the scalpel cutting noise again. It never came. Instead I heard the revving of a chainsaw. It tore through flesh, tearing away its target's humanity. It reduced a faceless girl to a stump. The same thing happened to countless other people. Trying to block it out, I crouched down, blocked my ears, closed my eyes, and convinced myself it was all just a bad dream. 
 
 During this time, I heard something that was being repeated. I had to strain my ears and force my earbones to vibrate at full capacity to make it out. 
 
 `` Dont'cha love me?'' was what I heard. This phrase was being repeated through the screams, the news reports, the scalpel, the chainsaw... I could n't deal with it anymore and tried to focus my thoughts, to regain control of my body so I would n't have to touch her; to keep seeing these things. 
 
 Then, the news report came through loud and clear: `` it has been determined that all of the victims were exposed to one thing in the hours before they were killed. This phrase came in different forms: speech, text, or even a call. If you see this phrase, do not hesitate to contact the local authorities.'' 
 
 The phrase shown next to the anchor's face was: `` Dont'cha love me?'' 
 
 At this point, all of the darkness, the screaming, the cutting, the blood, the... everything stopped. I slowly regained control of my body and finished the handshake. 
 
 `` You ok there, Scott? You look like you've seen some pretty bad shit.'' Julie said. 
 
 `` You have no idea. What time is it?'' 
 
 `` What do you mean? We just finished talking at around ten o'clock at night. It's 10:05PM. You've been here with me the whole time.'' 
 
 `` Did I really just shake your hand for five minutes?'' I said. 
 
 `` No, silly. The walk down took around four minutes. Anyways, I came up with some really cool ideas to discuss tomorrow! Dont'cha love me?'' 
 
 *Shit. *
", Adopt the formal and polite manner of speech characteristic of a Victorian gentleman or lady.,"It is unfortunate that I find myself compelled to address the matter of my aversion to physical contact, a condition which, I assure you, is not rooted in mental illness or OCD. Rather, it is a manifestation of my heightened perceptual abilities. Through the medium of touch, I am able to glimpse the emotional substrata of individuals, unveiling their deepest fears and vulnerabilities. It is as if I am peering into the recesses of their minds, unearthing unspoken sorrows and hidden aspirations.

The frequency of such revelations is disheartening. Every day, on my subway train, I encounter individuals whose lives have been irrevocably shaped by profound losses. The death of a beloved pet, the passing of a loved one, or the sting of financial hardship - all these events reverberate through the emotional tapestry of their being. It is as if their brains have erected protective barriers, shielding them from the pain of remembrance and the bitterness of circumstance.

Yet, with time, the burden of witnessing such suffering begins to diminish. Like a filter, the redundant and superficial elements of human experience fade into the background, leaving only the profound and enduring emotions. Then, there she came. A new client, her face etched with the unmistakable marks of distress, her voice dripping with urgency and desperation.

I took a swift glance at her file, a testament to her employer's unwavering trust, and met her eyes. They were piercing gray, reflecting the anguish that consumed her. Her hair, a cascade of brown curls, flowed down her back like a river flowing towards the sea. Her beauty, however, belied her distress. It was as if the radiance of her youth had been extinguished, leaving only the embers of despair.

I felt an overwhelming urge to reach out, to offer solace, but I knew that my touch would be unwelcome. Instead, I confined myself to the realm of observation, witnessing her pain in the privacy of her own mind. The encounter left an indelible mark on me, a sobering reminder of the interconnectedness of human emotions and the profound impact that each individual has on the world."
"Every morning began like this. Carly spent long minutes staring at herself in the bathroom, critiquing her outfit, toying with her make-up, and of course, obscuring the brazen label that her mother left on her each morning. 
 
 Everyone was labelled. Defined by whatever descriptor was last used to describe them. Because how else would people know what to think of you, if you did n't come emblazoned with a review from a previous encounter? 
 
 So every morning before she left for work, Carly's Mom made sure to refresh her label with a new adjective. Each day it was a variation of the same theme, words that her mother said were meant as encouragements. Today it read FATASS across her collarbone, written in thick red ink. 
 
 Carly adjusted her sign so that it hung just over her label. It was her best kept secret from her mother, what she claimed was a fashion statement to the other kids at school. Her sign read LABELS ARE LIES, and it worked to hide what her mother thought of her. At least until one of her friends bestowed her with a better adjective. 
 
 Carly headed off to school, wearing her punk sneer at anyone who raised a brow at her sign. By the time she'd taken a bus and a train and walked over about a mile to school, she'd received more stares and heard more muttering than she cared for. She could feel the label changing with each hushed whisper as people pointed her out to their friends, found their own adjectives for her so they did n't have to assume what laid under her sign. 
 
 `` Wearing a sign like that... you know she's got something to hide.'' 
 
 Carly never checked to see what adjectives appeared on her label, though it was usually all she could think about. Instead she simply checked to make sure her pants were pulled up and her shirt had n't crept into any fat folds before she headed to school.
"," Adopt the optimistic and imaginative tone of a retro futurist, envisioning a utopian future.","Every morning, Carly embarked upon a canvas of self-expression and defiance. In the mirror's reflection, she meticulously crafted her appearance, adorned with vibrant makeup and an emblazoned label that served as a testament to her individuality.

Every day, her mother bestowed upon her a new adjective, a label of encouragement that had become her bane. With each stroke of the pen, she painted a portrait of false empowerment, words that were meant to uplift yet ultimately served to ensnare. Today, the label read FATASS across her collarbone, a cruel reminder of her mother's misguided attempt to control her.

But Carly was not one to be cowed. With a sly grin, she donned her secret weapon - a sign that proclaimed LABELS ARE LIES. It was a rebellion against the system, a refusal to be defined by a single adjective. As she strutted through the streets, her sign elicited a symphony of reactions. People stared, whispered, and sneered. But Carly paid them no mind.

She knew that her label was a fleeting illusion, a mirage in the desert of conformity. Yet, she chose to embrace it, turning it into a source of strength. Each day, as she watched the label change, she felt a surge of empowerment. It was a reminder that she was her own master, her own artist, and her own creator.

In that moment, the bathroom mirror reflected a young woman of boundless potential, a beacon of hope amidst a sea of labels. Carly stood tall, her head held high, her spirit unbroken. The label may have been a constant reminder of her mother's judgment, but it was also a symbol of her resilience, her defiance, and her unwavering ability to defy the odds."
"It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous. 
 
 As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated. 
 
 My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous. 
 
 We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I do n't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me. 
 
 But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much. 
 
 In the end he left me, like they all did. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together. 
 
 I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way. 
 
 Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me. 
 
 And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68. 
 
 I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice. 
 
 `` Kelly, you're... a wonderful girl but... I... I... I never loved you.'' 
 
 The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever.
"," Use the lyrical and storytelling style of a medieval bard, full of adventure and heroism.","In the mists of ancient times, when tales danced through the meadows like the wind, I find myself in a tale of woe and resilience. Listen, traveler, for I shall spin a yarn of love, loss, and the enduring spirit of a heart forever etched in the annals of time.

In the beginning, there was a heart that longed for connection, yet guarded against the sting of rejection. It was a heart that had been scarred by the heartbreak of unreciprocated affection, a heart that feared the pain of being alone.

And so, fate intertwined the destinies of a solitary soul and a radiant being named Indy. He was the embodiment of warmth, charm, and boundless energy, a man whose heart knew no bounds. But their bond was shattered, like a fragile vase in the face of adversity.

My dear, it is a tale of repeated heartbreak, each relationship ending in a symphony of despair. Yet, through the darkest of times, the resilient heart endured, refusing to be broken.

Fast forward to the present, where fate took a cruel turn, bringing news of Indy's untimely demise. With flowers in hand, I rushed to his bedside, my heart pounding with a mix of dread and anticipation.

As I entered the room, the sight of his lifeless form filled me with grief. His eyes, once filled with life and love, were closed in eternal slumber. The words that tumbled from his lips pierced me like a blade, ""Kelly, you're... a wonderful girl but... I... I... I never loved you.""

In that moment, my world shattered, and I was consumed by sorrow. Yet, I knew that my heart, like the river, would flow onward, carrying the memories of those who had touched my soul.

And so, traveler, I leave you with this tale, a testament to the enduring spirit of a broken heart. It is a tale of resilience, a tale of the human capacity to overcome adversity, and a tale of the enduring power of love, even in the face of loss."
"`` Take that!'' 
 
 Sammy the Stegosaurus had just attacked Tommy the T-Rex. Tyler had learned in class that it was supposed to be the other way around since a T-Rex was a carno-vare or something like that, but he did n't care. 
 
 For the third time, he stared out the window into the garage Dad had disappeared into. What was taking so long? 
 
 `` I'll be right back,'' Dad said. That was about an hour ago. Tyler knew because they had also learned how to tell the time with a big-boy watch, and Mom had gotten him one a while ago. 
 
 The garage slowly opened. Dad stumbled out, smiling a bit as he waved to the men sitting in a circle, watching T.V. He held a plastic bag in his hand. 
 
 `` What did you buy, Dad?'' Tyler asked as his father settled into the front car seat. 
 
 Dad seemed a bit out of it. `` Buy? Oh, right. Daddy bought some herbs for dinner tonight.'' 
 
 Tyler shifted in his seat, left to right. He pulled on a string on the side of his left black pant leg. `` Is Mom going to cook tonight?'' 
 
 Dad did n't say anything. He only started the car. When Tyler looked into the mirror, Dad's eyes looked really red. Well, they've been red since this morning when they left the room with the flowers. 
 
 The car backed out of the driveway. Tyler felt the car sway a bit as they drove fast. Usually, when Dad drove fast it was on the Hello-Way, and not in the neighborhood. The boy watched as they just barely missed a cat. 
 
 `` Daddy?'' Tyler asked with a quiver. `` Is Mom... Is Mommy going to come home to cook dinner.'' 
 
 He heard sirens as his Dad slowed the car. Tyler would usually look around to see if he could spot a fire when he heard sirens, but not this time. 
 
 Dad parked and turned around. `` I do n't think so, Kiddo.''

The protagonist, Tyler, a young traveler, finds himself amidst a narrative that unfolds with the grace of a Titian masterpiece.

The sun casts long shadows upon the garage as the clock whispers the passage of time. The echoes of a T-Rex and Stegosaurus battle reverberate through the air, a testament to the boundless energy that permeates the scene. Yet, Tyler's mind is preoccupied with the enigmatic allure of the open garage and the enigmatic absence of his father.

A symphony of thoughts plays within his head, each one harmonizing with the symphony of the wind. The watch, a symbol of his newfound maturity, serves as a constant reminder of the time and the fleeting nature of moments. As the garage slowly reveals its secrets, his father emerges from within, his smile radiating like the sun.

In the confines of the automobile, a tantalizing aroma fills the air, emanating from the plastic bag held in his father's hand. Herbs, a testament to their culinary prowess, promise to nourish the body and soul. But as Tyler's gaze meets his father's, a sense of unease washes over him. His eyes notice the redness that has consumed his father's eyes since the morning, a reflection of the turmoil that lurks beneath the surface.

The car roars through the neighborhood, its momentum carrying it towards a perilous encounter with a feline predator. As the vehicle swerves to avoid the feline menace, Tyler's heart skips a beat, his fear palpable. The sirens pierce through the air, a harbinger of misfortune, but this time, they bring no solace.

The parking brake engages, and the engine cuts off, yet the echoes of the sirens linger in the air. In the face of his father's uncertain gaze, Tyler's heart sinks. The promise of a comforting meal fades into oblivion, replaced by a sense of dread and uncertainty.

As the sun casts long shadows across the driveway, Tyler finds himself alone, his dreams shattered. The day has taken much from him, but it has also gifted him with new experiences and a deeper understanding of the world that surrounds him. And with a newfound determination, he continues his journey, leaving an indelible mark on the canvas of time."
"`` Here he is covered in his dark black armor... The killer of my family..my friends and my LOVE!'' Light's eyes burned with rage as he saw Dark stand before him. 
 
 
 `` Does he think he can frighten people and rule over them forever?... Not anymore, all these years of suppression end now'' thoughts storm inside his brain. 
 
 
 `` All our ideals! Freedom! Liberty! all those different passions people had all those uniqueness we saw in people! He has destroyed all of them... He and his corrupted army,'The Union'....Deception and lies through sweet words promising'development' promising'peace'!....'' Light's teeth grind against each other leaving a grave impression on his face as he thought about the events of the past 20 years... It has been 30 years now since Dark and his army'The Union' took over the world... People were fed up with all the war, anarchy and exploitation they had faced that they easily started supporting'The Union' even though it was initially classified as a terrorist organisation. Light was among one of the first few people in his territory to leave his home to voluntarily join Dark. The Union took over the world pretty easily after emerging as a political party openly receiving massive support from the people throughout the world. Soon, a totalitarian regime was setup and people had only restricted freedom. This was a shock to some of the people such as light himself and his family and colleagues who held values such as liberty and free will high above anything. Soon, a rebel organisation was setup under the leadership of light named'The Uprising'. Now after 10 years of hit and run on both sides they finally meet. Dark had challenged Light openly to meet him at this place to put an end... an end to the 10 year struggle between the FRIENDS... Friends who once saw the same path to achieve same goals..Peace and Development. Dark had specifically chosen this place as this is where they first met... the place where Light came to enroll himself....the place where Light challenged Dark himself on hand-to-hand combat to display his skills. 
 
 
 `` Heh! Pathetic scum!... clad in white... how'fairy tale'ish `` Dark's anger was hotter than the desert's sand as he thought about what had happened 10 years before... when he was rejoicing with some of his officers.....the day when Light and his army launched a surprise attack inside Dark's home killing all of them, all the people who stood in the front lines and spent sleepless nights creating impenetrable strategies to build this regime....the regime of order....the regime of the'Union'. 
 
 
 `` I trusted him! I trusted his sword! I trusted his honor!'' Tears almost streaked down from Dark's void and grave eyes as he painfully remembered about the memory of the betrayal.....a betrayal from the only man he held equal to his own life and the man who he thought had the strength to defend the Union after his death. 
 
 
 `` How many years have I spent! Dreaming of building this empire... An empire of peace and order! An empire free from chaos! and he wants to destroy all this? For his puny ideals of complete freedom and liberty?....What the hell did we even achieve when we had all those ideals of liberty and freedom higher than order and development? We misunderstood each other... We fought with each other... We killed each other... We destroyed ourselves....We destroyed EARTH!'' Dark's sorrows turned into rage... a rage so inhuman in nature....His tears stopped mid-way as anger engulfed his eyes. 
 
 
 `` How many years has it been since we fought the last war? How can he not think about how much resources we have saved? How many lives we have spared and how much destruction has been prevented? Is he dumb enough to not consider that?... I know....He wants glory! heh! He wants to be read in books about how he'SAVED' earth from me.....He wants songs to be written about him! Only that could be his motive... after all people change!'' Dark took a firm grip over his blade. 
 
 
 `` THIS ENDS NOW!'' They both shouted in the same voice as they rushed towards each other. 
 
 The swords slashed and only one of the friends stood.
"," Adopt the smooth and improvisational tone of a jazz musician, full of rhythm and soul.","In the realm of improvisational jazz, Light emerged as a soul steeped in rhythm and raw emotion. With eyes burning with rage, he stood tall, facing Dark, his former ally turned nemesis. The memory of the past 20 years resurfaced, the echoes of war, the destruction of ideals, and the oppression of humanity reverberating within his mind.

The Union, a terrorist organization, had seized power, exploiting the people's desperation for peace and development. Light, a man of principle, had been among the first to resist the totalitarian regime. He had gathered a group of rebels, united in their pursuit of freedom and liberty.

After years of conflict, the two sides finally met. The stage was set for a showdown, a battle for the fate of the world. Dark, cunning and ruthless, had challenged Light to a final confrontation. It was a moment of reckoning, a chance to put an end to the strife that had consumed their lives.

As Light's improvisational spirit flowed through his words, he painted a vivid tapestry of the past, invoking memories of a time when ideals danced freely in the air. His passion, his rage, his longing for a world where freedom and development went hand in hand, resonated with all who heard his voice.

The jazz musician's spirit infused into Light's delivery, creating a symphony of emotion and resilience. As he stared down Dark, his eyes burned with determination, his voice carried the weight of a storm, promising a future where freedom and progress reigned supreme."
"Eli could have gone in through the skylight. First he ’ d cut at the glass with surgical precision, making not a sound in removing the severed pane. He ’ d then let a drone quadcopter fitted with a silenced pistol descend into the building. It would then be a case of scanning for heat signatures and pressing the kill button. Eli could do all that, but that would be too expensive. He had a reputation for efficiency, people didn ’ t come to him for those kinds of solutions. His clientele had tighter purse strings. 
 
 
 
 He went in with the same gear he ’ d used on dozens of runs. The budget didn ’ t give any room for one-off equipment. Black pants, silent when he moved. Dark boots, which were of course steel toe-capped. At his waist was a belt of simple tools. These he would use for pick locking, door breaking, and of course life ending. Most important was a navy turtleneck. Eli wouldn ’ t settle for anything less than total comfort on the job. 
 
 
 
 The assassin unhinged a window using a small crowbar. He winced as the metal creaked as it levered. After almost a minute of held breath and stifled curses the hinge gave a soft pop and gave in. He didn ’ t worry about someone catching sight, just heard. The adjacent neighbour was away on business, the poor sod ’ s wife was out cheating. Research could be done, even on a budget. Accessing information was easy if you had an internet connection these days. Binoculars helped to fill in the gaps. 
 
 After sliding himself in through the window, Eli managed his bearings. He a quick thanks to lazy construction workers. The place was a carbon copy reflection of the house five doors down. Up for sale he ’ d managed to view the place as a potential ‘ buyer ’. He double checked his watch before continuing, 01:43. The target should have been asleep for at least 2 hours now. He ’ d be well into the land of sweet dreams most likely not involving his own murder. 
 
 
 
 He went up the stairs, watching the stars as through the skylight. He mused to an alternate world, flashy suits, big clients, and cleaner kills. That ’ s just not the life for me, he thought. Wouldn ’ t suit it anyway Eli, you ’ re too... problematic. The pistol came out of it ’ s holster like a long lost friend. It felt comfortable like an old piece of jewelry, or a trusty shiv. He doubted many would agree with the sentiment and noted to not mention the thought out loud. 
 
 “ Tonight we earn our lunch money, ” he mouthed, placing his lips on the upper back of the pistol. He scrutinized the silencer. Too late to hesitate now, he thought and shrugged. 
 
 
 
 He nudged the door to the master bedroom open, pistol held outstretched. He rounded the corner, taking care not to put pressure in the centre of the creaky floorboards. His well adjusted night eyes caught the sight of a sleeping mass under the covers. He took aim, and let his breath out. His finger itched over the trigger, but something didn ’ t feel right. The body was too small, the soft breathing too feminine, too young. 
 
 He crept closer, bringing himself closer to inspect the sleeping figure. It lay on its side facing away from him by the doorway. Even with his disadvantaged perspective it was obvious he ’ d just crept into the bedroom of an unassuming girl. 
 
 
 
 What the fuck is this? His mind began to race. He wasn ’ t one to get squeamish on the job, but he needed to know these things. Killing kids was just out of the question. His work was to be simple and without complication. The pile of covers shuffled, a slight girlish humm came from within. A floorboard creaked in complaint against his sudden lurch back away from the bed. Eli tried to shift his weight, but the offending sound was unrecoverable. 
 
 
 
 “ Daddy, is that you? ”

"I opened my eyes slowly, and rubbed them. My head hurt, and the soft glow of the heavenly landscape was killing my hangover. I was pissed that God had woken me up early, but whatever; the guy was pretty cool, gave me a sick dental package, and the job was pretty easy. What does it mean to be a being of the eighth order of the ninefold celestial hierarchy? Fuck if I know. God has all these fancy rules and mythology surrounding this place but the truth is, if you're not a dick, God's cool. He's actually a pretty chill guy. The only thing he gets pissed about is those `` God Hates Fags'' protesters. He says it's because it's ethically reprehensible. Truthfully, I know he's just pissed because he's gay. But let's just keep that between you and me, ( he's not so keen on outing himself yet - he's waiting for the next pope to start the ball rolling ). 
 
 
 Anyways, I was hungover as hell from going out with Jesus last night, and getting drunk as hell. The guy is great, but he likes to ride that white pony a little too much, if you catch my drift. He was also pretty depressed; his dad had recently found out he had screwed him over a couple millennia back. 
 It was a couple days before 0AD, and Jesus had been raising quite the ruckus. He had started a cult, a group of locals as a joke, but it had grown into something far more serious. Under the guise of `` Christians'' Jesus had started to undermine the local government. It was fine with him, but to God, it was pissing him off. The Romans were entertaining, had some dope-ass chariot races, and all in all were n't that hard to control. But Jesus' new project was making human life a headache for God. 
 
 
 As punishment, God sacrificed his only son for the sins of humanity. It was a decent deal for Jesus; he got to go live back home in heaven, and because there was nowhere else for him to go, he was free to party and do as he pleased, ( outside of the realm of Earth ), for all of eternity. The trouble was, *Jesus never went through with it. * After getting drunk one night, he told me it was all an act. Mary Magdeline, ( they were friends with benefits ), simply brought him some red paint to rub on himself and his hands, hired a couple drunk romans to pretend to beat him and built a realistic looking crucifix. In actuality, all he did was hold the nails and pretend to moan. After everyone left him crucified for a couple hours, Jesus got down, took Magdeline to his buddies loft in a nearby cave, and they made sweet love for an entire weekend. Meanwhile, God, who thinks he's doing both Jesus and Humans a favour looks like a doofus. 
 
 
 Today, God found out that Jesus had pulled a fast one on him, so now, thanks to my douchebag friend Jesus, I've got to go cleanse the world of sinners. With Jesus' fake sacrifice, there are a hell of a lot more than we ever anticipated, and it looks like God wants me to do a full cleanse, ( he's a real fan of cleanse's, ever since he became a massive Beyonce fan ). So that's my day, making the end nigh for my fellow humans. It's going to be a busy week - the rapture today, the end of the world, and then starting humanity all over again *next* week. Thanks *Jesus. * Whatever though, him and I are going to get *wasted* after work. 
 
 
 All in all, for you, it might seem crazy to destroy all of humanity in a few short hours, and that such carnage might take both a mental and physical toll. Well, to you, something like watching Transformers 4 all the way through is an eternity. For me, all of human existence goes by in the blink of an eye. Time's pretty meaningless when it's infinite. Well, whatever friends, I've got to go - drinks are on Jesus tonight.

"Gosh, is n't he good looking? He's just so handsome and strong. And brave, too! Supermegaman is the most awesomest hero that there ever was! He can fly faster than a speeding bullet AND is the world's greatest detective and how about that fancy magic ring of his! 
 
 And it's just like he said. Everyone can be a hero. We just have to believe in ourselves and stand up for what is right. And then we'll be heroes, too! Well, mostly Supermegaman will be THE hero and the rest of us have just have to get out of his way. 
 
 But though it will be mostly Supermegaman who will save the day, we can do our part, too. With that evil supervillain, Zod Bane the Joker, on the loose, we will never be totally safe. I mean, sure, a few city blocks will get demolished, millions of nameless people ( which most likely I will be one of ) will either become homeless or will die just so that Supermegaman can save his really hot maybe/maybe-not girlfriend all the while fighting, but refusing to kill the one bad guy who constantly threatens and successfully kills us on an almost daily basis because Supermegaman has taken an oath to never take a life. 
 
 But hey, who cares? It's Supermegaman! He's the symbol of hope! He's what we aspire to be! We all love him. *I* love him. Gosh, is n't he just swell? 
 
 I'm sorry what was that? Are n't I upset that my life is a movie and that I am neither the protagonist nor the antagonist but a mere afterthought?

", Dive deep into the psychological complexity and philosophical depth characteristic of Dostoevsky's works.,"The world is a canvas upon which each individual paints their own unique masterpiece. Yet, amidst the myriad strokes and hues, one portrait stands tall, its subject a testament to the transformative power of heroism. Supermegaman, a symbol etched in the hearts of countless souls, embodies the ethos of courage and resilience.

The hero's appearance belies his formidable strength and unwavering determination. His muscular frame and lightning-fast speed rival the wind's fury, while his piercing gaze and unwavering resolve inspire countless others to believe in their own capacity for heroism. The ring of power he wields is not merely a testament to his power but a symbol of the collective strength that lies within each human heart.

In the face of adversity, Supermegaman's unwavering spirit resonates with all. He stands tall against the formidable villain, Zod Bane the Joker, a testament to the enduring triumph of good over evil. Although the destruction wrought by Bane's reign is undeniable, Supermegaman's presence brings solace, reminding his followers that even in the darkest of times, hope persists.

While Supermegaman may be the singular hero who ultimately saves the day, each individual can contribute to the tapestry of change. By standing up for what is right, by courageously confronting injustice, we all have the potential to become heroes in our own right. The collective power of empathy, compassion, and resilience can be a force that moves mountains and brings about lasting change.

Yet, amidst the grandeur of Supermegaman's heroism, one must acknowledge the bittersweet reality of our predicament. Our lives are often characterized by an absence of agency and an inability to influence the grand narrative. It is tempting to despair, to feel as if our contributions are insignificant. However, it is precisely in these moments of seeming insignificance that we discover the power of empathy and compassion.

In conclusion, Supermegaman may be the protagonist in the grand narrative of our lives, but each individual has the potential to play a role in shaping the world for the better. By believing in ourselves, standing up for what is right, and cultivating compassion, we can all contribute to the creation of a more just and equitable society. The legacy of Supermegaman lives on, reminding us that even the smallest act of courage can have a profound impact on the world."
"It began with a prompt. A simple writing prompt designed with the intent to scare or frighten the reader. Harmless enough right? So I began. I wrote a tale of some hapless reader coming along and reading through comments on such a prompt hoping for something that might actually reach out to them and touch them, to remind them of their own mortality, or at least make them feel real. But no, no stories of gore or frightening monsters lurking behind the visible fabrics of reality, waiting to burst forth through the reader's imagination were found by the reader. They left, disappointed once again by the lack of content, blissfully unaware. Unaware of the horrors that they and everyone around them constantly keep at bay, simply by not acknowledging their existence. You see, that is their only weakness. Not the reader's. The others, the beings existing outside of the simple 3-dimensional existence we call and assert as reality. That is our power. Only by our belief, no matter how fleeting, varying from an absent-minded daydream to a fully fleshed out novel, can these creatures enter our realm. We are not aware of it, probably because of our own belief that man can not simply `` create''. That is why when they came we were shocked by how familiar our demise felt. Yet no one truthfully knew how it all began.

"It was n't often I got to enjoy a full day. School was littered with bullies and I could n't do anything right according to the world. A good grade lead to me being called a brown noser, or implying I had done `` favors'' for the teacher to earn that grade. A bad grade was rewarded with insults to my intelligence. `` Dipshit'' was something I got used to hearing, it stopped hurting after a while. Jessica was particularly mean. It was almost like she could read my mind and find out what I was worried about; she'd look at me with those piercing blue eyes and could call me out on the zit I tried to cover up. If I felt even an ounce of fear, she'd find me. 
 
 She and her pals started hanging out at the pizza joint I liked to frequent, and with that I lost one of my mental breaks. The two arcade machines were tucked in the back of the joint, and they always sat two tables away. The silver lining's that I save more of my allowance by not going there anymore I suppose. 
 
 Eventually her boyfriend caught wind of her hobby, and he started to pick on me too. She would rip me apart mentally, pecking at each of my insecurities and he would physically hurt me. He did his best to make it look accidental, never did he get in trouble. Fuck him. Chad. It's always *Chad*. This douchebag wore his socks to his shins and those fucking white sneakers. He'd step on my heels and blame me for getting dirt on the bottom of his shoe, try to shove me down and demand I'd clean them. A teacher walked by once and the smile I forced felt so hollow. 
 
 She did n't get paid enough to care. 
 
 I started keeping track of how they hurt me, I kept a journal of some sort. Eventually turned them into comics, but with a fantasy twist. I was the hero, and they were the force stopping me from destiny. As I posted them online, people found similarities in my style and a recently published online game. Comments flooded my inbox recommending I try it out, saying it'd be a nice way to relieve stress and relax. 
 
 After installing and patching it, I made my character. I made a little elf girl with tan skin and platinum blonde hair. I found it silly that I was a paladin but all I wore was a bikini, but the comedy was nice. The first real smile I had in a while. Over the months, I'd get abused during school hours, come home and race to my computer, my escape. I ended up in a guild of other players, and we'd push the game's content as soon as it was released, we had internal competitions to push each other. We'd run dungeons naked, laugh at our losses and cry at our ridiculous victories. 
 
 It was the first time in a while that I paused, and felt myself smiling. Genuinely happy. I became best friends with the guild's officer. He was a lucky beta player who got to reserve a hella short name, so he got `` Wrath.'' It was a little edgy, but when you saw him decked out in his end game gear, the name fit. He was our top DPS in the guild and if the party wiped, he'd still be able to finish the job. 
 
 `` Hey, Wrath I wo n't be able to raid this weekend,'' I started to type out, `` My school's doing a festival this weekend and I've to help set shit up on Thursday.'' For good measure, I emoted a /shrug. His character emoted a surprised expression. 
 
 `` Woah! Me too! Is it a holiday or something?'' 
 
 `` Nah, just school spirit week, we beat the Wolves last week and it's been our first win in years apparently'' 
 
 His character didnt move. Then a minute passed and he responded. 
 `` Sorry, had to pee -- but what. Wolves? You go to HJHS?'' 
 
 He knew my school! He knew my school! 
 `` Yeah -- - you?'' 
 
 `` Shit, yeah! We should meet up!'' 
 
 The conversation had moved to the private messaging system where we promised to meet up at the coffee shop by the school, after we were done setting up. He'd promised to wear a pink sweater. I said I'd meet him and figured it'd be easy enough to find a dude in pink.

 The day came and the hours were slow. During class I could n't help but watch the clock, and it felt like every second had doubled in duration. 
 
 `` Hey fuckwad, you should watch the teacher not the clock if you ever want to do something other than flip burgers.'' 
 I flipped the bird and Chad scowled back at me. He deserved to be told to fuck off, but I knew I'd get it later. 
 
 `` Watch your hands, kid.'' And of course, Jessica had to defend her fucking knight in shining armor. Even if she did n't even need protecting, considering her words had enough venom to kill. 
 
 The teacher hushed us and went back to teaching, and the class would n't go by any faster.

 Evening came, and I had just finished my job of setting up all of the tables for the sales area. Useless school merch would be sold by the thousands and people would inevitably throw them out when they moved on to college. Whatever, sales meant we had gym equipment, I guess. 
 
 I dashed out the doors, sprinting until I got to the sidewalk. Realizing that Wrath could be near by or see me, I stopped. I've to walk, be cool. It's my chance to have a friend in real life. I'd finally be able to have fun in school and maybe pick up my life again. 
 
 I pushed the doors to the coffee shop open, looking around the room. 
 
 
 
 Four different people in the room had blue on. I could n't go up to them and ask `` hey are you wrath from Definite Dynasty Oline?'' No, I'm already enough of a loser. Alright, well let's narrow it down. That guy's like 40 and reading a newspaper. No, he would n't even know how to log in. Then there's... ugh, the shiver went through my spine... Jessica. Her dopey boy-toy wasnt around though and she was browsing some pink website. Nah, she would n't play video games. Then the other two with blue were talking with each other. 
 
 Maybe it was the two dudes talking, or maybe Wrath had n't arrived yet. I ordered a tea and took a seat. I could wait around, maybe he was running late. 
 
 -- 
 
 The cafe had emptied, but the only people who had stuck around was some business dude in a suit, bearing no blue, and Jessica. 
 
 I got up and dropped my plastic cup into the trash and moved towards the door. My hand on the glass, I had my thoughts broken by a voice. 
 
 `` W-Wait!'' 
 
 I turned around, and there was Jessica with her laptop closed in hand. She looked different. 
 
 `` You faggot, that door says `` Pull.'' Ca n't do anything right can you?'' I frowned, turned to look at the door. She was right. 
 
 `` Look --'' she started. No, today was supposed to be my day. I was going to meet Wrath, Iw as going to have a beginning to a new life, a new friend. 
 
 `` No, Jessica, I do n't give a shit. You can insult me tommorow, call me shit for brains of `` gaylord'' another day, but not today. I take you and your boyfriend's shit every day I'm at school, can you at least give it a rest when I'm doing my own thing? Why the fuck do you feel the need to insult me everytime you see me? Does it make you feel better? Do you feel like you're in charge for fucking once?'' 
 
 Her eyes were locked on mine, and her lip trembled. Crap, I'd gone too far, now I was the bu -- no she deserved this. She did worse to me on a daily basis. She was vile, cruel and abusive and nothing would change. 
 
 `` Just fuck off and let me be hap-'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry.'' 
 
 `` -py for -- You what?'' I lost my momentum, she'd stolen it with two simple words. Granted, she was being forgiven any time soon, but I could n't sit here and berrate her when she'd just humbled herself. I was n't as cruel as she was. Her hands moved, and she pulled her laptop from her side, opening it up. 
 
 On the page was the game. Character selection screen, and there was Wrath. The Wrath I knew, that I confided in and that I had befriended. The one that listened to my qualms, gave me advice, carried my ass through dungeon after dungeon. The one who lead our guild with such charisma, and the one who'd always keep people together. 
 
 `` Y-You. You're. You're-'' I stuttered, hand gripping the handle of the door to brace myself. 
 
 `` I did n't want anyone to know I was such a fucking nerd... I picked on you so people would n't pick on me, and I did n't realize... Look, I'm sorry. I've been shit. I do n't expect you to forgive me, I do n't deserve to be --'' 
 
 I was dumbstruck. 
 
 `` I did n't even realize it was you,'' she continued, `` I always thought of you as another girl online who had a bad life and I did n't realize it was you... The more I thought of this girl, the more guilt I'd built for picking on you, and I planned to stop, but Chad kept... It does n't matter, I ca n't excuse it, but I'd like to make it up to you. Can we not be enemies, at least?'' 
 
 I bit my lip and locked eyes. She was genuine, and her fingers fidgeted with the laptop. She was nervous. She had feelings, she was a person and even if she was secretly Satan, she was also the Wrath I knew. 
 
 I took a breath, almost in disbelief to what I was ready to say, `` How about we start again as friends?''

A bad grade was punished with insults to my intelligence. People called me "" dipshit"" all the time, but it stopped hurting after a while. Jessica was particularly mean. It was almost like she could read my mind and find out what I was worried about; she'd look at me with those piercing blue eyes and could call me out on the zit I tried to cover up. If I felt even a little bit scared, she'd find me.

"William was tired. Fed to the back teeth he was. Adventuring, killin' bads. Rescuing damsels in distress - It was all really beginning to get him down. But he knew it was not in his hands. He knew that all this in the control of the storyteller. And he was tired of it. O-oh he was *tired*. So all things considered - his next steps would be quite easy. It was a simple twist in his mind - and he was able to see four dimensions. Not *see* them as they are - but have them materialise as a set of analogies. Four dimensions squeezing into three dimensional perception. He stepped.... fourthways. The place where the narrator works made itself into a metaphor reflecting his opinion of the place. A large dark cavern with tall black pillars was his new position. In front of him was a large lake filled with a more-liquid-than-gas ethereal mist. A giant stairway rose up out over the lake. He approached. Climbing the stairwell - and not really noticing the fact that he crossed a vast distance between the lake and the place he came from in very little time, he climbed it. Anger and weariness are an odd match - but surprisingly, on William they seemed like strawberries and cream, apple and danish blue, chedder and crackers. He drew his sword with this odd feeling overlaid on him and

Sir William saw that which was concealed by the noble scriptor up'till Williams hideous deed – a pulpit of stone and ivory. Upon which there laid a Book – open wide to watch the approach of Sir William. Sir Willim picked up the Pen. ** 
 
 William went out into the world and built himself a house in which to live. The house was made out of... wattle and daub... it had nine bean rows.. a hive for the honey bee... aaand... he lived happily ever after there. 
 
 **Sir William looked up. Nothing had changed. Foolish man. His face was filled with disappointment in the book - which he threw off the pedestal into the sea of mist. Forth from the gloom of the edges of the cavern came a cloaked spokesman - a representative of the narrators. ** 
 
 **'' Surely you should know by now - we do not govern your decisions... it is YOU who chooses which way to go in life. We do not control your plot, YOU do. It has been in your control all along. The idea of a higher control was simply an excuse you built in your mind for your actions. We are not the storymakers. We are the scriptors. `` ** 
 
 
 **Sir William, alas, could not accept this. He raised his mighty blade again and struck the hooded head from the spokesman shoulders. He ran along the edge of the ethereal lake until he found another stairwell, which he climbed. Atop the stairs he found another scriptor. Lifting his sword for the third time he. **

 I must admit that I feel guilty for what I did to William. It was the only way I could make him understand - the reality of the situation is too confusing.

"," Adopt the smooth and improvisational tone of a jazz musician, full of rhythm and soul.","William was weary, his soul spent from the constant battle against evil. Rescuing damsels and slaying villains had taken its toll, leaving him feeling helpless and frustrated. He knew that the narrative was not his to control, and the burden of his actions weighed heavily on his mind. In a moment of exhaustion, he decided to take a break, his mind wandering into a realm of abstraction. This newfound perspective revealed four dimensions, blurring the boundaries of perception. He stepped into this abstract realm, his surroundings taking on a metaphorical form. The place he found was shrouded in darkness, with tall pillars reaching towards the sky. A vast lake filled with mist lay before him, and a towering staircase rose up from its depths. As he climbed the stairs, anger and weariness mingled with his exhaustion, creating a unique sensation. With his sword drawn, he battled his way forward, the echoes of his blade resonating through the cavernous space.

In this abstract realm, William's actions were intertwined with the narrative. He found solace in creating his own world, a place where he could live freely and without the burden of his past. The house he built was a testament to his resilience, a symbol of his ability to overcome adversity and find happiness.

"`` Thing is, Nolan, criminals should n't feel offended at being called roaches.'' 
 
 The reporter raised an eyebrow at me from across the coffee table. We were in a Starbucks on a Friday night, full of chatty teenagers. Sometimes, either one of us would need to raise our voices to be heard. `` Why is that, Mr. Clay?'' 
 
 I sipped my coffee. `` See, we got one thing in common with those dirty sons of bitches. When the light comes on, we run.'' 
 
 `` Yet earlier, you said you're different.'' 
 
 `` Tell me, do you trust the government?'' 
 
 Nolan shrugged. `` I do n't think my opinion—'' 
 
 `` Answer the damned question.'' 
 
 `` Not really. I mean, everyone knows they're spying on us. Even as a journalist, I do n't always get to—'' 
 
 `` So if you ordinary folk do n't trust the government, what makes you think criminals will? Come forth and let your sins be washed away, as long as you committed them in this or that year, arbitrarily chosen by your man in that big white house?'' 
 
 I scoffed. `` Was brought up Christian, you know. Far as I know, only one fella can pardon you. Humans ai n't so forgiving or forgetful.'' 
 
 Nolan's expression became thoughtful. `` Last year, the government chose 2012. Fifty-six people came forward with confessions.'' 
 
 `` I saw the newspapers. Eighty murders in total, along with a bunch of petty crimes. One woman ate six of her neighbors' cats. Hilarious.'' 
 
 `` Really? I do n't see what's funny about that.'' 
 
 I laughed. `` The cats? Who cares about the cats? I'm talking about the math. Eighty murders? There are several times that number of homicides alone in New York City, let alone the state or the country. Does n't that prove what I've been saying? Criminals do n't want a spotlight on them. How many of those fifty-six ended up being re-arrested for other crimes in other un-pardoned years?'' 
 
 `` More than half.'' Before I could interrupt, he said, `` Let's revisit my earlier question. Why, then, are you keen on publicity?'' 
 
 `` You're making me blush. I do n't know what you're talking about.'' 
 
 `` 1978. You murdered seven people. Or so you confessed.'' 
 
 `` Eight, actually. She was looking for her mom and dad, and would n't stop crying.'' 
 
 Nolan blanched, but turned a page on his notebook. `` 1996. A shooting in Central Park. Fifteen dead, including two police officers.'' 
 
 I shrugged. `` I wanted to clear the air. The Russian mob was making their move; I was only defending myself. Everyone accused my organization of being responsible. But that's nothing compared to the bus bomb bank robbery in December.'' 
 
 `` I understand you were arrested for that.'' 
 
 `` Released two years later when the government decided to pardon that year.'' I leaned forward and motioned for him to come closer. `` Listen, you wan na know what I think? The real reason behind these pardons?'' His eyes gained a hungry look. `` Yes, you can write this down.'' 
 
 `` I think the government just wanted a way to pardon their own people. You know, the assassinations and the espionage and the sabotage and spying, on Americans by Americans. Those guys in suits, working for all those three-acronym agencies, they do a lot more shit than us. Why else would they pardon crimes from 1999 to 2001?'' 
 
 Nolan licked his lips and did n't answer, jotting furiously. 
 
 Smirking, I leaned back. `` Besides, when you confess, you get a reputation. Respect. No, not from local shrimps. The big players. 2001 was a pretty great year for me. Sold a lot of intel to foreign players.'' 
 
 `` You did n't confess that,'' Nolan said. 
 
 `` Off the record, please.'' I drained my cup of coffee and looked at my watch. `` Well, the biggest one was still 2012, of course. I believe you wrote the article.'Crime lord comes clean; biggest theft of the century'.'' 
 
 `` Man, those banks and financial institutions just do n't get it, do they? It's the information age! Security first; efficiency and whatnot second. Twenty billion. Twenty and frickin' loads of zeroes. That's what they get for underestimating Chinese tech.'' 
 
 Nolan nodded and flipped a page. `` Let's move to the big question, shall we? You're making a confession tomorrow for 2015; care to give me the scoop?'' 
 
 I grinned. `` How about a riddle? The Vietnamese ambassador. Fourteen train carriages. Ca n't be giving you everything, right? You a journalist, do some research. Texan governor. The four judges. The Syrian massacre.'' 
 
 Nolan gulped. `` I... I guess I have some reading to do.'' 
 
 `` Sure you do. Well, I think we'll be seeing each other in court tomorrow.'' 
 
 We stood and shook hands. As I turned to leave, a young man whose face was full of piercings came up to me. `` You Mr. Clay?'' 
 
 I nodded. 
 
 He pushed a gun into my chest and opened fire. There was screaming, and a lot of people running, but I could n't turn my head much from the floor. The boy backed away as Nolan crouched beside me. 
 
 `` There's a reason why roaches do n't show themselves,'' he said softly. `` Because, eventually, all pests meet the same end. You're a big man, Mr. Clay, but too arrogant for your own good. Just because the government would n't touch you, does n't mean we wo n't.'' 
 
 `` And guess what?'' He took the gun from the young man's hand and held it against my temple. `` Next year, when the government decides 2016 was a great year, they would n't even hold this against me.''

"," Emulate Morrison's lyrical prose, exploring themes of identity, race, and humanity with depth and nuance.","In the tapestry of life, the threads of identity, race, and humanity intertwine, revealing the complexities of the human condition. As I sip my coffee in this bustling Starbucks, the reporter's question reverberates through my mind, ""Why is that, Mr. Clay?'' The answer, it would seem, lies in the shared vulnerabilities that bind us all.

The words ""roaches"" and ""run"" echo through the air, a testament to our innate survival instincts. In the face of adversity, we retreat into our shells, seeking refuge in the shadows. The light, a symbol of truth and exposure, casts a revealing light upon our actions, bringing to light the sins we have committed and the potential consequences of our choices.

The government's intrusive nature is a source of concern for many, and rightfully so. The feeling of being watched and monitored is a pervasive one, and it is difficult to shake the feeling that our privacy is being violated. When we question authority, we are often met with resistance and indifference. It is as if the powers that be are more concerned with maintaining their grip on power than with protecting the rights of their citizens.

My Christian upbringing has instilled in me a belief in forgiveness and redemption. However, I understand that humans are not always capable of such compassion. The passage of time and the weight of our actions can be formidable barriers to forgiveness. The woman who devoured her neighbors' cats may have been driven by desperation or mental instability, but her crime was undeniably cruel and heartless. It is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, the potential for evil remains.

The statistics speak for themselves. The number of murders committed in New York City alone is alarming, and the fact that many of the perpetrators were re-arrested for other crimes is a sobering thought. It is a testament to the interconnectedness of our lives and the cyclical nature of crime.

In conclusion, the journey of human existence is fraught with challenges and uncertainties. We are all roaches in our own way, running from the light and grappling with the consequences of our actions. The question of identity, race, and humanity is a complex one, and there is no easy answer. However, it is essential to recognize the shared vulnerabilities that bind us all and to strive towards a more just and compassionate society."
"Jury duty, what kind of nonsense is this. How can they even put this man on trial for a crime where no body exists? I picked that meat to the bone and threw the bones to the pigs. 
 
 I really do n't know who enjoyed the meal more, the pigs and I probably equally squealed in delight. Regardless the most this man should be charged with is kidnapping. But even that is putting things to a stretch. Honestly the only crime he ever committed was having the same physical description as me. 6'2, blonde, blue eyes, muscular build and a tendency to visit Tom's tavern. I have only been twice and he was there both times. I mean it makes it so much easier when you find a nice scapegoat. 
 
 Anyways looking at him I can tell that our protein sources are way different. He does n't have the sharp incisors required to tear human flesh from the bone. That kind of sharpness does n't come easy. I spent months filing my teeth down with a nail file. I had originally thought about using one of those metal files to expedite the matter nut I felt like it would n't give me the precise control I needed. The finite precision where I can draw blood with the softest bite. 
 
 The real question on my mind is how did they ever pin this guy with the murder? I understand that I probably have been eating out a bit too often and the local authorities need someone to pin the crimes on, but how do they even know a crime existed? 
 
 I guess I am fortunate enough to get a first hand account of all the details. Dammit, I'm hungry and looking at the Asian prosecutor all I can think is I want some Chinese.

The scent of damp earth and coal smoke permeated the air, a symphony of olfactory sensations. As I sat upon my trusty armchair, a jury summons served as a testament to the absurdity of human justice.

The case presented before me was shrouded in an enigmatic veil of ambiguity. No body had been discovered, yet a man stood accused of murder. It was a mystery that defied logic and ignited my skepticism. I cast a critical eye upon the accused, his physical likeness mirroring my own, a cruel coincidence that would later prove pivotal to the case.

As I examined his teeth, I noticed the absence of the sharp incisors necessary to rend flesh from bone. I had meticulously filed my teeth down to a razor's edge, a testament to the precision and strength required to commit such a vile act. The similarities between our physical attributes were uncanny, yet I knew that they did not signify guilt.

The question that consumed me was how the authorities had pinned the murder on this unsuspecting man. It was as if they had conjured a scapegoat out of thin air, a victim of circumstance rather than a cunning criminal. I pondered my own appetite, the irresistible aroma of Chinese cuisine dancing through my mind.

In the end, I could not shake the feeling that justice had been served, albeit in a roundabout fashion. As the fog dissipated, casting long shadows across the city, I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had played a part in unraveling the mystery."

"I called Christine again. No answer. Damn, I thought, what could possibly be going on? I thought the date two weeks ago had gone so well. Dinner at my place, Star Wars, make-out session that led to a passionate night that ended in cuddling. Did I do something wrong? 
 
 I had thought it was strange when she cancelled our date on Friday. Stomach bug she said. Something had irked me. Intuition one could say. But I had let it go. But three days later with texts of no return and a missed call, something was up. 
 
 I paced back and forth, mystified and angry at what was going on. Christine and I had been set up by a mutual friend from college and we clicked. At 26, I felt that things were finally going my way in the relationship department. It may be cliche and teenager-y, but I felt that I found `` The One.'' 
 
 I sighed. I knew what this was. I have seen it before. Christine was breaking up with me. He wanted to kick himself. So stupid, start to fall for a girl and then, it's over. Well, might as well get this over with. 
 
 Driving the car, ready to face the music. If Christine is going to break up with me, I do n't want there to be any ignoring games. Let's do this in person like adults. I felt a stirring in my right pocket, a vibration. Trying not to get my hopes up, I frisked my phone out. It was Christine! Carefully trying to keep my eyes somewhat on the road, I answered. 
 
 `` Hello?'' 
 
 `` John, it's Christine. Listen, I hate to do this over the phone, but I do n't think we should see each other anymore.'' 
 
 There it was. I hate being right. 
 
 `` Christine. Can we talk about this please?'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry, I really am but I do n't have time to talk. I'm doing a big paper right now and I -'' 
 
 `` Five minutes. I'm coming over now and-'' 
 
 `` No John! Do n't come over!'' 
 She sounded scared, panicky even. 
 
 `` It's too late. I'm here now.'' I ended the call. Parking the car, I jumped out and went to the door. I needed to see her one last time. It would suck but I needed that resolution. I needed to be the adult. Christine was acting like a child for Christ sake. 
 
 I opened her door and called out, `` Christine, please let's just talk and end this.'' 
 
 `` No, John. I do n't want, I ca n't see you like this! Please just go!'' 
 
 I strode her house looking for her, finally locating her in the kitchen. A half-emptied bottle of wine occupied the table with her, face-down in her arms. She was sobbing. 
 
 `` Christine please be reasonable. Why ca n't we be together?'' 
 
 `` John, I ca n't be with you. We're not aging the same!!'' 
 
 I froze. Oh no, not that. It did n't effect everyone but when it did, you could tell. I spoke softly. 
 
 `` Christine, I... I'm sorry I did n't know, but that does n't matter to me. I will care for you, I do n't care.'' 
 Christine let out a choked sob. 
 
 `` But I do care. Please go. I do n't want to see you like this.'' 
 
 I grabbed her, I needed to see her face. 
 `` Christine, please. Just look at me.'' 
 
 `` No John, do n't!'' 
 
 We struggled as I went for her arms. Pinning them down, I looked at her hard. 
 
 Her eyes were red from crying, but no visible changes. She still looked 26 from her face. I looked at her hands. No wrinkles, smooth as always. I looked again at her face. She refused to make eye contact with me. She was looking up, at my hair. 
 
 `` Christine what are you-'' 
 
 With a careful, trembling hand, she touched my cheek and turned my head to the mirror in her kitchen. There, I saw myself with a head full of grey hair.
"," Rewrite the essay as if it were an ancient Egyptian chronicle, detailing events in honor of pharaohs and gods, using appropriate terminology and references.","In the name of Osiris and Isis, I chronicle the tale of a Pharaoh's heart filled with divine inspiration and passion, intertwined with the cosmic dance of fate and destiny. In this land of fertile soil and towering temples, the spirit of Pharaoh danced with the rhythm of the stars, honoring the gods above and enacting his divine will upon the earth.

The tale unfolds with the tale of a young Pharaoh named John, adorned with the blessings of Osiris and blessed with the wisdom of the gods. One fateful evening, fate intertwined with the cosmic tapestry, bringing him face to face with a muse named Christine. Their connection, as profound as the Nile River flowing through the land, ignited a passion that would forever alter the course of their lives.

Yet, fate took a cruel turn, casting a shadow upon the Pharaoh's heart. Christine, a woman of beauty and grace, suddenly found herself faced with a storm of emotions. A stomach bug had cast her into a vortex of distress, and her words, ""I have a stomach bug,"" reverberated through the halls of their hearts. But the gods whispered secrets to John, revealing that this was not merely a case of illness, but a divine decree, a tapestry woven with threads of fate and heartbreak.

In the face of adversity, John's spirit burned bright. He paced back and forth, mystified and filled with anger, but he knew that it was time to confront the truth. With determination etched in his heart, he drove his chariot, ready to face the inevitable. As he drove, fate intervened, bringing a message from the heavens. His phone vibrated, and it was Christine, her voice dripping with despair.

""Hello,"" John spoke into his phone, his voice trembling with anticipation.

""John, it's Christine. Listen, I hate to do this over the phone, but I do n't think we should see each other anymore.""

The Pharaoh's heart sank into the abyss of despair. He knew that his reign of passion had been abruptly ended, but he understood that fate had woven its intricate design upon his heart, a design destined to teach him lessons of resilience and grace.

With a mixture of sorrow and determination, John began his journey to find solace in the embrace of the gods. As he walked away from the ruins of his broken relationship, he felt a sense of liberation, knowing that the gods were watching over him, guiding him towards a brighter future."
"“ Hey, sleepy head! ” The voice whispered. The voice was soft, full of warmth, and unmistakable. The voice of a woman. “ Wake up, boy. It ’ s your turn to make breakfast this time! You promised. ” 
 
 There was an air of familiarity with that voice. I felt awake, but my eyes remained shut. I began to feel the slow movement of her fingers walk along my chest. A smile slowly formed across my face as I struggled to open my eyes, but they just could not open. However, that touch -- -- that voice? It was significant. It was unique. Unmistakable. I knew this person. Then I felt her hair drape along my torso, her fingers continued along to the center of my chest. They stopped, and then I felt one finger begin to trace a path to the left side of my chest. She was tracing my tattoo. 
 
 Donna. The only woman who would do that. 
 
 I was able to groggily get my voice to work. “ In a minute…or ten. ” Still keeping my grin across my face. 
 
 “ How about— “ My mind began to race, “ now! ” 
 
 I felt a hand gently claw at the right side of my chest and begin to put pressure on it. She was tickling me. My eyes snapped open, while I instantaneously grabbed hold of both her arms. I was slightly blinded by the sunlight shining through the bedroom window, but I could finally match the face to voice. 
 
 Donna. The only woman who was brighter than the sun. 
 
 Her deep brown eyes gazed into my blue eyes. It was electric, I felt like the hairs on my body were going to stand up. My soul stirred as we continued to lock eyes. Her long, beautiful black hair draped down from her head, touching my cheeks. She started to slowly lean down to my face, her hands undoing her black bra. I leaned upwards to meet her lips -- - 
 
 BANG! An extremely bright flash of light. 
 
 A gunshot. A false awakening. 
 
 This isn ’ t where the story starts. That was a distant memory of what my life used to be like. Donna had vanished a couple months ago. A mysterious disappearance that rocked the small northern Virginia town we lived in. 
 
 Another gunshot. Another flash of blinding light. 
 
 I haven ’ t slept the same since that very day. My memory has been getting hazier and the number of hours I normally sleep for, has been gradually decreasing over time. Fuck, I can ’ t even remember how many hours I slept last night. Did I even go to sleep? Is that question even relevant? No. 
 
 My eyes opened a second time. I was sitting on the ground, my back laid up against a brick building. It was very dark out. Would've been almost pitch black, but there was a bright red and blue neon sign that flashed above me. I couldn ’ t read it, not because I wasn ’ t capable of reading; the sign was in a foreign language, made up of Asian characters. I looked back down and across from me into the darkness. I was in a small back alley, away from the main roads. I could hear the incessant beeping and honking from traffic nearby, a dog barking, a male voice yelling off in the distance, and muffled techno music coming from a shoddy apartment building nearby. 
 
 An overwhelming feeling began to dread over me. None of my surroundings were familiar to me. Where am I? This isn ’ t the Chinatown I ’ m familiar with back in DC. I know that I have a purpose for being here though. I have a goal. A mission. I remember being on a plane, that much is true. However, when was that? 
 
 My eyes were fixated on something else, however. 
 
 The body of a man lay face down ahead of me. A small river of blood flowing away from his body and making its way toward me. I dragged myself up onto my two feet and stood up. I walked over to the body and began to examine him. He was a lanky fellow, with black shoulder length hair. He was dressed in a dirty white t-shirt, bright blue jeans, and blue sneakers. He had three exit wounds in his back, a pistol still in his hand. 
 
 Another flashback. 
 
 I remember being ambushed after shortly getting out of a cab and walking through an alleyway. A bag was placed over my head and I was beaten unconscious. Next thing I know, I was strapped to a chair in a dimly lit room. I was in some apartment being held captive by some unknown hoods. They were casually speaking to each other. It clicked in my head that they were speaking Japanese. I ’ m in Japan, but where in Japan? How long ago was that? Nothing else was clicking for me. 
 
 Suddenly an overwhelming feeling of dread began to creep over me. Had I sleepwalked again? Did I have another one of those “ episodes ” again? I could feel a drop of sweat coursing down my forehead. I started to breathe heavily, and a sharp pain pulsed from my right shoulder. I looked over to my right and I could see my reflection in a dark window. My dark brown hair was a mess, I had a blackened right eye, and a small cut on the left side of my mouth. I had a grey t-shirt underneath a blue and grey flannel shirt, black jeans, and black/white Chuck Taylors. I looked at my right shoulder to see that there was a rip in the sleeve and a bloody gash. A bullet had grazed me, and it burned like hell. I looked down further and noticed that I was holding onto a pistol of my own. 
 
 It was empty. I went back over to the body and took the pistol from the dead man ’ s hand. I tossed mine into a bucket of dirty water and began to walk away towards the exit of the alleyway. A red and black 1984 Toyota AE86 hatchback sat at the exit. I reached into my back pocket and produced some keys, I guess it was mine. How I even got a hold of it, I don ’ t want to know. I opened up the door on the left side of the car, forgetting that Japanese cars are right-hand drive. I corrected the mistake and made my way over to the right door. I climbed inside and inserted the key into the ignition. My mind was going a thousand miles an hour, not even taking the time to even think about the dead body that had laid before me. I had deduced that I had another one of my sleepwalking “ episodes. ” I angrily punched the steering wheel, setting off the horn which, in turn, startled me. I looked around cautiously again, scanning my surroundings for any more vengeful hoods to show up and avenge their fallen comrade. With no one in sight, I pressed my left foot down onto the clutch pedal and turned the ignition. The car hummed to life, with the headlights rising out from the front. With my left foot still down on the clutch, my right foot on the brake, I disengaged the parking brake. I shifted into first gear, and began to make my escape. 
 
 I didn ’ t know where I was going, but I had an idea of where to go next. I managed to put quite a few city blocks between me and the scene of the crime. Suddenly, a pair of headlights began rapidly approaching from behind. I realized my ordeal was not over yet and downshifted into third gear, giving the old car a small boost of acceleration. My mission was going to have to wait. 
 
 For now.

"To everyone, 
 
 We can say I was never right after Mom died, that he death was the start of mine. The weekend drinking gatherings turned into all week drinking binges. I'm sorry for it all, but that's not why this letter is here. It's to remind you all that despite doing nothing to help me, I still love you all. I was the one who had to take care of her arrangements, the one who was there for years, holding myself back so that *someone* was around for her, so she was n't alone when she died.

You all came to me when things started to go downhill for all of you and you expected me to save you from drowning while my head was under the water the whole time.

", Capture the ambitious and jargon-filled language of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur.,"To everyone,

My loss of my mother was devastating, and it had a profound impact on me. The social gatherings that once took place on weekends transformed into weekly drinking binges. I understand that this may be a sensitive topic, but I feel compelled to share my experience in the hope of helping others.

My primary concern is not to dwell on my personal tragedy but to convey the importance of self-reliance and resilience. I was the one who had to take care of my mother's arrangements, the one who was there for years, holding myself back so that someone else could be there for her. I did everything I could to ensure that she was not alone during her final moments.

However, it is disheartening to see how everyone has become dependent on others. Drinking became an attempt to escape the harsh reality of life and the uncertainties that lay ahead. You all came to me when things started to go downhill for all of you, expecting me to save you from drowning while my head was under the water the whole time. I haven't been able to provide that solid rock, that shoulder to cry on, for a very long time.

The sad part is that no one has noticed my struggles. But I know that you will notice. It's inevitable. It'll probably be a few days before you do, because none of you call, stop by, or even text, but you'll notice. I expect it all to crumble for all of you because you could never stand on your own, always relying on Mom or myself to help you, but now that both of us are gone, I hope the worst happens."

 `` Is there something I can help you with, sir?'' 
 
 Martin was so absorbed in the handheld that the sudden appearance of the manager next to him almost caused him to drop it. 
 
 He cleared his throat. `` I uh... I need to recover some files off of my bricked Toshiba five terabyte hard drive.''

 Martin analyzed the room, expressionless. `` How much?'' 
 
 `` One hundred dollars for six hours. Three-fifty for a day.'' 
 
 Martin noticed that one of the helmets on the far side of the room was outlined in bright, fiery red lights. He gestured toward it `` What's the deal with that one?'' 
 
 The two men walked over to the woman, and the manager bent down to take her pulse. `` Dead. You get these sometimes. She was hooked up for three days and threatened to report my operation if I pulled her out in the middle of it. That and I did n't want to risk severe mental damage.'' 
 
 He pulled the helmet off. The woman stared blankly forward, mouth slightly agape. Somewhere else in the room a client descended into a fit of laughter. 
 
 Martin had seen enough. He pulled out his handcuffs. `` Josh Clark, you are under arrest for the crimes of being a provider of Virtual Reality Services, and Negligent Homicide. You have the right to remain silent.''

"Ricky remembers little of his life before he decided to join the army. His parents were against it, though, that much he's sure of. Everybody was against it. But his will was stronger. He was n't gon na let the very first nation in the world fall down on its knees in front of the enemy without putting up a fight. He believed he was doing what every young man his age should do, really. 
 
 
 The chances of him coming back were slim and he knew it. If you had asked him, he'd say he was n't doing for himself and he was right at that. He'd pitch some half-thought speech that he had rehearsed some times before, about the nation and the importance of his duty and how he would n't take anything less than a victory for his country. The guys who had a chance to listen to this realized at the time how right he was. He had a point, young Ricky. 
 
 
 Thing is, Ricky's memory of the time before the army was kind of hazy. The training was very intense, every soldier said the same. The army was n't preparing just their bodies, but their minds, too. And that involved a lot of military drugs; to make sure kids would n't freak out in the middle of the battlefield, minimize the ocurrence of shellshock, all that psychological stuff that the government had found a way to deal with. 
 
 
 Of course he remembered his parentes, being a kid, growing up as an awkard teenager and everything. It was just the period right before the army that was a little fuzzy in his mind. He payed no thought to it, though, as none of his friends ever did. His mind was occupied with much more important things. He had lost some friends, he had killed some guys, he had done the whole lot. All in the name of duty. He'd been promoted to sergeant and got some medals along with it. He had n't been able to talk to his parents, but he was sure they were proud of him, if they were getting his letters. They never got to answer them, since he was always moving from one place to another. 
 
 
 This one day Ricky went to the Major's office to request his vacation, like he would always do. He'd been stationed at the camp for about two months then and had been serving for 3 years without ever getting a vacation. He really missed his parents and his young brother Arthur. The major denied his request, as always; something about lack of manpower, which sounded as bullshit to Ricky. He never questioned it, though, could n't have. It was the major's word and that was that. He could only come back in a week and ask again, wishing for better luck next time. 
 
 
 But on that specific day, something on the major's office caught Ricky's attention. The newspaper on the major's desk said something about some Arthur Holler, a sixteen year old boy. That could very well be Ricky's brother, he would be about that age then. There was no papers in the army camps, to keep the young killer minds focused on killing, so Ricky had to stole the major's if he ever wanted to read it. And that was exactly what he did. Of course this would have no bigger consequences, even if he got caught. 
 
 
 He read the news with a big grin on his face. It really was his brother, by the likes of it: Arthur Holler, sixteen year old, Old Hamilton High School. Everything was a match. Apparently, his brother became some High School hot-shot. He had made the touch down that got his school the national prize. Ricky was very excited and happy for his little brother. He always knew Arthur was going to be big. 
 
 
 But the excitement went away rather quickly. There was a picture of Arthur holding the cup on the other page. He was next to a guy that looked a lot like Ricky. A lot, except for one little detail. On the guy's arm there was no number, and Ricky had had the inscription `` 1005941'' on his left arm since he joined the army. But he had a little scar next to his right eye, the same Ricky had since he fell off his bike when he was just a little boy. And suddenly he got it all. He remembered the scientific experimentation that was going on a little before the war started. The new way of warfare that the army has been developing, according to the news of the time. He realized he was n't really himself. 
 
 
 He stormed in the major's office, who was already on the phone asking for someone to find him. Ricky demanded explanations. The major said everything would be answered with a file he kept on his drawer. Ricky asked to see it, but the last thing he saw was the metallic colt.45 that the major had as a souvenir. Rick had time to think the gun was too old to fire a bullet before he had hit the ground. 
 
 

"," Rewrite the text using modern slang, abbreviations, and the casual style of a tech-savvy teenager.","Yo, Ricky's got a hazy memory of his life before he joined the army. His parents were totally against it, but he was like, ""I'm not gonna let my country fall down on its knees."" He believed he was doing what every young man his age should do.

The chances of him coming back were super slim, but he knew it. If you had asked him, he'd say he was doing it for his country, and he was right. He'd pitch some half-thought speech that he had rehearsed, about the nation and the importance of his duty. The guys who had a chance to listen to this realized at the time how right he was. He had a point, young Ricky.

Thing is, the training was intense, every soldier said the same. The army was preparing not just their bodies, but their minds, too. And that involved a lot of drugs. To make sure kids wouldn't freak out in the middle of the battlefield, minimize the ocurrence of shellshock, all that psychological stuff that the government had found a way to deal with.

Of course, Ricky remembered his parentes, being a kid, growing up as an awkard teenager and everything. It was just the period right before the army that was a little fuzzy in his mind. He payed no thought to it, though, as none of his friends ever did. His mind was occupied with much more important things. He had lost some friends, he had killed some guys, he had done the whole lot. All in the name of duty. He'd been promoted to sergeant and got some medals along with it. He had n't been able to talk to his parents, but he was sure they were proud of him."
"`` Please stop,'' I whispered through my hands covering my face, rubbing my eyes as I could feel my eyelids get heavier and heavier. 
 
 She did n't say anything. She has n't for some time. I've been trying to talk to her for the past twenty minutes to no avail. She does n't even look at me. She sits there, with her knees at her chest and her hands, her beautiful hands with green-chipped fingernails, folded over each knee. She was looking off to her right at nothing but the wall. 
 
 `` Could you please stop ignoring me?'' I asked. Hell, I begged. 
 
 I started rubbing the back of my hand, rubbing at the ink stamp of a monkey with his tongue out and x's over his eyes. I was licking my fingers and rubbing in a circular motion, but it seemed like this thing was really on there. Her ink stamp was still on, but it was smeared in a way that the entire monkey was moving to the right. 
 
 `` You looked so beautiful that night, did I ever tell you that?'' I heard her sniff and I took my attention from my ink stamp to look at her. A single tear ran down her face, leaving a trail of salty water above it. It ran over the perfect contour of her cheek bone and then sank in to the convex shape of her cheeks. Her eyes were closed now. 
 
 `` I did n't mean to hurt you,'' I said as I stood up and got closer to her, `` I just really liked you and I did n't know how else to act.'' 
 
 She did n't say anything. I was really starting to feel bad. I felt awful. 
 
 I rubbed the tear away from her face and she jerked her entire head away from me. I sighed, walked over to the coffee table that was being fortified by the *Relationships for Dummies* book that I had. The cover was really creased and screwed up from the leg of the table. I unloaded my pockets, tossed my cell phone, which was dead, on the glass table top, my cigarette box, which had one left, on top of my phone, my little baggie of pills and my wallet all on the tabletop. 
 
 `` Those are n't too tight, are they, Miranda?'' 
 
 She still did n't say anything. 
 
 `` If you do n't answer me, things are going to get a lot worse,'' I said, unbuckling my belt and running it out from underneath the belt loops. 
 
 `` Please do n't,'' she said through the rag tied around her head, shifting her weight, sliding her feet out from next to her buttocks and straightening them out, bringing her knees close together. She brought her hands close to her chest and the sound of the metal links clinking against each other. 
 
 I tossed my belt at her feet and the belt buckle made a loud thud against the wooden floor, which caused her to jump. 
 
 `` I would n't have slipped that in your drink if you would have only danced with me.'' 
 
 `` No,'' she whined, squeezing her eyes shut and her shoulders shook. 
 
 `` Shush, baby, come on, please,'' I begged. 
 
 `` Why? Why are you doing this to me?'' she moaned as I ran my hand across her thigh. 
 
 I looked up at her. She was now crying more steadily. I rubbed the side of my finger across her cheek and picked up two more tears and kept my hand on her face. 
 
 `` Why do you think, honey?''
"," Adopt the exhilarating and descriptive style of a globetrotting adventurer, discovering new cultures.","A kaleidoscope of emotions danced through my senses as I stared at the woman's serene face, her eyes closed in slumber. The ink stamp of a monkey with its tongue out and x's over its eyes mocked me from my hand, but my attention was solely on the beauty that lay before me. Her hands, adorned with chipped fingernails, were folded over each knee, her knees drawn up to her chest. The wall served as her backdrop, a canvas against which her reverent posture unfolded.

A silent conversation had been brewing for the past twenty minutes, a symphony of unspoken words and intense emotions. I had attempted to engage her in a dialogue, but she had chosen to remain silent, her eyes gazing at nothing but the wall. The ink stamp, a testament to her vibrant past, remained stubbornly intact, its smear spreading like a narrative across her cheek.

My desperation to bridge the gap between us grew, and I spoke my words in a desperate attempt to elicit a response. But my pleas fell on deaf ears. Her beauty, like the moonlit sky, was intoxicating, yet beyond my reach. As I stood up and reached out to her, my heart sank with the realization that my intentions had been misunderstood.

I rubbed the single tear that streamed down her face, my guilt growing with each touch. Her head snapped away from me, her eyes wide with fear and confusion. I sighed, my frustration mounting, and walked over to the coffee table, my thoughts mirroring the intricate patterns woven into the rug beneath me. The book, ""Relationships for Dummies,"" rested precariously on the table, its cover tattered from countless reads. With a sigh, I unloaded my pockets, discarded my phone and cigarette box, and arranged my belongings in an orderly fashion.

As I glanced at her, I couldn't help but feel a wave of regret. Her beauty, like the sun, illuminated the room, yet it was a beauty that I could not grasp. The ink stamp, a symbol of her past, served as a reminder that life, like a river, can lead us astray from our intended course. And so I sat there, alone, reflecting on the fleeting nature of beauty and the profound impact it can have on our lives."
"The wizard Nadir and his knight-errant, Parallax, stood, stunned, above the corpse of the greater stone golem. The golem ’ s corpse lay across the flat earth of the desert. A wind whipped at the cloth of Nadir ’ s robe, and curved across the armor of Parallax. Parallax ’ s chest heaved up and down, exhausted from the battle with the golem. Nadir ’ s hands were covered in soot and stains, a byproduct of the magic he ’ d used. The two stood side by side, and stared down at the treasure the golem had been protecting. 
 
 “ What is it? ” Parallax asked, sheathing her sword. 
 
 “ I don ’ t … I don ’ t quite know. ” Nadir replied. 
 
 The two were staring at a small, brown bag the golem seemed to have coveted. They ’ d opened the bag, and inside had been a brown disk, flat and circular. The brown disk seemed to have the quality of a burnt baked good; flakes and ripples covered its surface. Currently, the disk sat next to the opened brown bag, both the wizard and the knight nervous about touching such a strange artifact. 
 
 “ What do you mean you don ’ t know? ” Parallax asked, turning her head towards Nadir. “ I thought you were a master of the occult. ” 
 
 “ W-w-well of course I am! ” Nadir stuttered out, his face turning read. “ But this isn ’ t occult. Nothing, none of my tomes or scrolls have ever mentioned something like this. ” Nadir said, gesturing madly at the flaking brown wafter sitting at their feet. 
 
 The two turned their attention back to their loot. They stood in silence for a few moments, trying to come to a conclusion. Nadir ’ s mind ran and sprinted through his expansive knowledge of the occult magicks. Nothing was of use. As for Parallax, she looked back on her experiences. She had travelled the land, fought countless monsters and demons, goblins and ghouls, explored countless dungeons and caverns, abandoned forts and ruins. Yet nothing she had seen came close to this bizarre wafer. In a way, it reminded her of overcooked bread, but what would a stone golem be doing with a pastry. 
 
 “ We don ’ t have much time to waste. We need to meet up with Aphelion before the light wanes to the night. ” Nadir spoke up, breaking the silence. “ It ’ s obvious it ’ s food. Go pick it up, and try some Parallax, then we can finally solve this mystery and be on our way. ” 
 
 Parallax bulked. “ Why me? And how do you know it ’ s food even. Why don ’ t you pick it up and try some? ” She replied, incredulous. 
 
 “ Because I ’ m paying you, that ’ s why. ” Nadir said. 
 
 “ Not enough to risk my life on some poisoned trap. ” Parallax replied. 
 
 Nadir thought for a moment. He stroked his chin, and his mind tumbled through all sorts of devious plans and manipulations. Finally, He settled on a plan of attack to trick Parallax into eating the strange brown wafer. 
 
 “ I ’ ll give you fifty gold pieces to eat it. ” Nadir replied; a small, devious smile on the wizard ’ s lips. 
 
 Parallax went to argue, but stopped herself. She thought about Nadir ’ s offer for a moment, and weighed her chances. With a shrug, she bent down to pick up the wafter. It felt soft in her hands, and bits of the top flaked off in the wind of the desert. 
 
 She brought the wafer up to her face. She stared at it for a moment, steeling herself. With the thought of fifty gold pieces in her mind, and all that the money could buy, she took a bite, suddenly and quickly, diving in, trying not to think of the consequences. Her teeth tore easily into the soft wafer, and soon a piece was being chewed up in her mouth. 
 
 The horror and trepidation Parallax had felt were soon replaced by surprise and delight. The brown wafer inside of her mouth tasted delicious. It was soft, moist, sugary, chocolatey, savory. It seemed to be some sort of bread or pastry, unknown to the realm of the humans. Parallax savored the bite, and reluctantly swallowed. Her eyes were wide in pleasure. 
 
 “ So, how is it? ” Nadir asked, anxious to know. 
 
 Startled, Parallax shook her head. She put on a sour look, and faced Nadir. “ It is … quite awful. Foul and disgusting; unholy even. ” She replied, putting the brown wafer into a small pocket. “ It must be burned. I ’ ll dispose of it as soon as we set up camp for the night. ” 
 
 Nadir nodded his head in thought. “ Hmm. A shame. I wonder why a stone golem would be hiding something so awful. ” 
 
 Nadir handed Parallax a small pouch of gold pieces. Soon, the two were off, trekking through the desert again. Parallax tried to hide a sly smile. She couldn ’ t help but think of the delicious beauty of the brown wafer, and made plans to have a little piece of it every night before she fell asleep.

", Adopt the formal and polite manner of speech characteristic of a Victorian gentleman or lady.,"The wind whipped and roared, carrying with it the scent of the desert, as Nadir and Parallax stood above the fallen stone golem. The corpse lay sprawled across the barren earth, testament to the battle that had taken place. The wizard and his knight-errant stared down at the treasure the golem had guarded, a treasure that would bring them untold riches and power.

""What is it?"" Parallax asked, her voice dripping with exhaustion. She had fought tirelessly against the monstrous creature, and her chest heaved with the strain of battle.

""I do not... I do not quite know,"" Nadir replied, his voice laced with uncertainty. The brown disk sat untouched in the bag, its secrets waiting to be unveiled.

""What do you mean you don't know? You are a master of the occult!"" Parallax exclaimed, her tone sharp as a blade.

Nadir flushed with embarrassment. ""Well... of course I am! But this isn't occult. Nothing in my books or scrolls has ever mentioned anything like this.""

The two stood in silence, their minds grappling with the enigmatic artifact. The brown disk seemed to taunt them, its flakes and ripples dancing in the wind. It was as if the stone golem had hidden a secret just for them, a secret that promised to change their lives forever.

As the sun dipped behind the dunes, casting long shadows across the desert, Nadir and Parallax began to unpack the mystery of the brown disk. With trembling hands, they examined its surface, hoping to find some clue that would lead them to its secrets. But alas, the disk remained an enigma, a mystery that would forever remain unsolved."
"God is n't the almighty, not a being of supreme 
 power like great legends portray. His posture is poor, he keeps his hair short, he's pale and skinny. Nothing like the colossal being depicted in great works of art. His bones are glass; he is hollow, he is weak. Our leader, the creator of all things, he is feeble. We are more powerful than he is, now. 
 
 He tells me of how he got this way. Once, yes, he was capable of striking fear in those who worshipped him. He was strong, he was charming, he was in charge. But not enough worship him to keep him in such a state. Those who call themselves Christians know nothing of his intentions for earth; they weaken him with their sin. God is a husk of what he once was. He is a flower left in the desert. He is nothing at all. 
 
 He tries to respond to prayers, but so few are worthy of his glorious gifts. The Pope is one of the few he believes are still faithful to him, his prayers are listened to. All leaders of his faith prior spewed lies, led his cherished people to scorn others and condemn those who are different. God does n't approve of that. Francis understands. He has love in his heart for all things, he tries to steer his followers to the right path. Francis will get a spot by his side in Heaven. 
 
 The Lord is old. His bones creek when he walks, his chairs never get a chance to breathe. No one around him seems to care much for him. They let him rot, they let him watch his beautiful world, the one he worked so hard to create, go to waste. His biggest mistake was putting people on it. His creation was so grand, his biggest success. Now it's polluted, dirty. He's ashamed of it. 
 
 God does not consider him to be in power anymore. He handles nothing by himself. It's those that he has created that he leaves in charge. He just hopes that his children know the right direction to follow. He's too tired to help them anymore.
"," Adopt the gritty, laconic style of a noir detective, with a dark, atmospheric tone.","But God, he's not worried about himself anymore. He's got bigger fish to fry. He's too tired to help anybody.

"It had been going on for centuries. Mother to daughter, daughter to mother. For nine hundred years their fates had been fused, unable to escape each other for long. As the mother died, her soul was denied a path to the afterlife and forced into the womb of the child, to be reborn and take the opposing role. 
 
 Once the child was only nine years old. 
 
 But today... today the would escape their fate. Nine hundred years of torment would end- no more watching lovers died, no more forced pregnancies, no more grandchild-siblings. They had both had enough of the world... and each other. 
 
 That was why it had to end. They'd waited until the daughter-mother was old enough, and both bought a revolver. They had one last meal together, with a good wine. They hugged each other one last time, and said their goodbyes.

A victim to a haunting plight.

To break this chain, to find solace.

Two hearts intertwined, ready to fall.

A farewell filled with sorrow and dread.

Two souls intertwined, forever at peace.
No more torment, no more pain,
In the realms of the eternal rain."

 The interplanetary mail system ( IMS ) chirped. Jerry Lee stopped sipping his morning coffee immediately. He rubbed his eyeballs a few times. He walked away, came back but the screen was still as he originally read it. The location the message had originated from was sector 1765 or what captains of the fleet liked to call red territory. There are rumors and tales told by cultists groups about how the forefathers of UPF ( United Planet of Freedom ) warned them of the Red territory. Something about Communist bastards can always be heard around those circles. Jerry ran and got Lewis, his supervisor. Lewis also had a hard time believing what he saw. 
 
 Working at the IMS was an easy job as Jerry's career advisor put it. You just receive messages and relay them to their owners. Most of the messages Jerry received were from Clooney IV one of UPF's many moons. But this was different. It was forbidden by the galactic Congress to enter communications with any systems not fully pledged to democracy. If the rumors about the red territory are true then there is a certainty that relaying that message would be a all expenses paid trip to Maximum Security Prison. Jerry looked at the recipient who was supposed to receive this message and it read Vladimir Milkev. 
 
 Jerry and Lewis looked at each other and knew what they were about to do. He hovered the selector over the link and selected it. A picture of a very promiscuous female appeared on the screen. `` Get your Martian lover today!'' It read in big red letters. 
 `` Fucking Spam'' Lewis said as he deleted the message.

The IMS chirped, its metallic symphony echoing through the cosmic corridors. Jerry Lee, a man of discerning taste and unwavering determination, paused his morning coffee. His eyeballs danced in disbelief, as the screen illuminated with a message bearing the ominous insignia of sector 1765, colloquially known as ""red territory.""

Rumors whisper tales of the forefathers' warnings, tales of the red territory being a treacherous landscape shrouded in the shadows of tyranny. As the words danced from the screen, they painted a picture of the consequences that awaited those who dared defy the galactic decree.

But fear not, my dear listener, for within this tale, there is a glimmer of hope amidst the perilous abyss. For it is a story of courage, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of justice.

With swiftness, Jerry retrieved his supervisor, Lewis, and together they deciphered the enigmatic message, its content a testament to the insidious nature of propaganda and manipulation.

The message, crafted with the deft hand of a mischievous elf, boasted of the pleasures of Martian companionship and adorned with alluring imagery of a promiscuous female. But Lewis, a man of impeccable judgment and unwavering integrity, recognized the insidious nature of the message and swiftly deleted it into the digital abyss.

May this tale serve as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the importance of vigilance and the enduring spirit of those who dare to fight for freedom."

 The government steps in and forces the market to lock-limit-down and close, some say for the rest of the week. I know better. The cascade has already started.

She asks me if this was just a fluke, if it's over now and if everything will go back to normal tomorrow. I sigh, I stand, I pull her close. `` Everything is going to be okay,'' I lied to her as I held her in my arms.
"," Adopt King's knack for storytelling, blending the ordinary with the supernatural in a compelling narrative.","The air crackles with the scent of anticipation. The clock strikes 0930, and the S&P pit erupts into life. I am the maestro of this symphony of financial destruction, a predator carving his name in the blood of the market. My fingers dance across the keyboard, orchestrating a symphony of trades, each one a symphony of greed and desperation.

The contracts tumble like grains of sand, the price plummeting with the speed of a runaway train. The pit erupts into a symphony of screams and shouts, the air thick with the scent of fear and desperation. I am a surgeon, dissecting the market, carving away the extraneous fat, leaving only the lean, taut muscle of pure volatility.

With each passing trade, I inch closer to my prey. The buyers, like flies, are drawn to the irresistible scent of destruction. They dance and prance, their greed fueling my appetite. I feed on their fear, their desperation, and the blood of their accounts.

As I watch the price spiral downward, my heart fills with a sense of satisfaction. This is not merely a game of financial manipulation; it is a battle, a war against the very fabric of the market. I am the catalyst, the weaver of chaos, the architect of destruction.

And the blood flows. The market convulses, the traders wither, and I emerge unscathed, a king crowned amidst the wreckage. The symphony of destruction fades, leaving behind only the echoes of my own triumph."
"`` What?'' I ask, a puzzled look splattered across my face. 
 
 `` God,'' the man informs me, `` he's dead'' 
 
 `` How? Why? I mean that ca n't be possible I spoke to him just last night!'' 
 
 The man hands me a small pamphlet, along with an offer to take back all churchly possessions I may have. 
 
 `` Your God is dead, what now?'' It reads. I shoo the man out and lock my doors.

"," Emulate the writing of a Renaissance scholar, filled with references to classical knowledge, art, and the humanist perspective.","In the vein of a Renaissance scholar, I am compelled to pen this reflection upon the recent tragedy that has cast a somber shadow upon the world. The demise of a beloved deity, accompanied by the concomitant destruction wrought by an insidious virus, has evoked a profound sense of bewilderment and despair.

The news arrived like a bolt from the blue, shattering my illusion of a harmonious existence. The words ""God is dead"" echoed through my mind, reverberating with the tragic melody of human hubris and the capricious nature of fate. It is as if the gods themselves have turned against us, casting their wrath upon a world that has long since forsaken its ancient wisdom and embraced the intoxicating allure of greed and self-destruction.

The pamphlet, a testament to the absurdity of religious dogma, served as a stark reminder of the dogma that has so misguided humanity for centuries. Its message, ""Your God is dead, what now?"" is a potent indictment of blind faith and the illusory nature of salvation. It is as if the veil of illusion has been lifted, revealing the grim reality that lies beneath.

The news of widespread looting and the demise of prestigious religious institutions further saltates my wounds. It is as if the vultures of greed have descended upon the ruins of civilization, feeding upon the ashes of hope and compassion. Scientists have documented the spread of a deadly virus, a testament to the interconnectedness of all things and the fragility of human existence.

In this moment of profound sorrow, I find solace in the immutable truth that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope. The human spirit has an unparalleled capacity for resilience, adaptation, and compassion. It is through these qualities that we can overcome the challenges that lie before us and build a brighter future."
"Waking up naked on a cold metal table whit a bright light illuminating his every fibre, all he could think was... nothing. `` Where am I, who are you, what do...''. His line of panicked questions were cut short when one of the silhouettes, with a mixture of fear and hope in her voice, turned to Marc and asked'The artefact, where is it?' 
 
 With the press of a button the lamp was turned off, and Marc's eyes could slowly begin to make out the shape of not one, but three people standing around him. All three looking weary, with exhaustion ever present in their eyes. The sound of a not so distant boom made them look at the door in the other end of the small run down room they were in. Something was not right about this. 
 
 `` Sir, he has suffered from a short term memory loss'' a voice said gesturing to Marc, still laying on the cold table.'Its no good, we'll have to try again'' the female silhouette, who in the lack of the bright lamp was starting to take on the shape of a uniformed medic, said in a cold, almost fearful voice. 
 `` There is no time, this is our only chance. He'll have to make do'' The man who was clearly in charge said with a commanding voice. 
 
 Marc was helped off the table, and yet all he could think of was the nightmares he had. With the tables... Wait, is this still a dream? Marc's line of thought were quickly interrupted when a loud explosion blew open the door, flinging one soldier across the room. Another soldier were knocked to the ground and did not make a sound, nor move. 
 
 The commander gave Marc a uniform, complete with some sort of weapon `` You still remember how to use this, right?'' The commander smiled at Marc's confused expression when he put his clothes on. Marc picked up the bottle - sized weapon and, as if by instinct, knew there would be a stinging sensation when the weapon connected to his implants in his arm. 
 
 His helmet made the same sting, when a red overlay appeared in Marc's left eye filled with weapon status, health, and GPS coordinates. 
 Marc was surprised, almost shocked. Not that this was happening, but that he knew to expect it. He turned with a quirk in his mouth to the commander, `` I know where the artefact is located Sir, This way''. 
 
 He put his weapon into combat mode, activated thermal sighting mode on the helmet, stepped over the dead bodies on the floor and moved out the door with a confidence that by now had infected everyone around him as they made their final stand against the uprising of the squirrels
"," Employ Austen's keen social commentary and irony, wrapped in the elegance of the Regency era.","Awoke on a frigid metal table, the stark light illuminating the meager surroundings, Marc felt an unsettling void. His panicked inquiries, silenced by the sudden appearance of three weary figures, mirrored the emptiness within him. The cold emanating from the dim lamp cast long shadows across the room, mirroring the ominous foreboding that permeated the atmosphere.

The medic's voice, laced with fear and desperation, echoed through the room, confirming Marc's worst nightmares. The memories, vivid as a dream, were fading like smoke in the wind. As he was extricated from the cold metal embrace, the nightmares resurfaced, threatening to engulf him.

A deafening explosion shattered the tranquility, sending one soldier sprawling across the room and another to the ground. The commanding officer, his voice laced with urgency, instructed Marc to put on the uniform and weapon. With a sense of foreboding, he donned the cumbersome gear, the weapon biting into his implants with a sharp sting.

The helmet, a symbol of both protection and imprisonment, inflicted a similar sensation. As he donned the helmet, a holographic overlay materialized in his left eye, revealing weapon status, health indicators, and battlefield information. It was as if, in this moment, his mind was being merged with the machine, transforming him into a cold, calculating weapon."
"Frank knew at this moment that he was losing his mind. The nanites which had been touted as such an improvement for humanity was slowly stripping his sense of being away. The longer they stayed in his body and the more they multiplied, the more of them there were in his head, the less human he felt. Why was that? Did n't they do testing? Why the hell was n't he angry about this? 
 
 Frank realised that he'd ceased to be him. He was still self-aware but felt nothing. Where was his passion, his love? He only had cold, logical reason left. And it made him feel satisfied, but not good. Never good, never again for the rest of his immortal life.
"," Adapt the text to mimic the tone and style of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, often dark with moral lessons.","In the twilight realm where shadows danced with whispers of despair, Frank stood at the precipice of madness. His nanites, once hailed as beacons of progress, had ensnared him in a vortex of oblivion. The more they multiplied, the further he ventured into the abyss of his own mind. With each nanite that invaded his body, a piece of his humanity was devoured, leaving behind only cold, logical reason.

As the nanites danced their wicked game, Frank's passion and love were consumed, leaving him with only a hollow shell of self-awareness. His heart, once brimming with emotions, now resonated with an emptiness that consumed him. The satisfaction he derived from his cold, logical reason only served to amplify his sense of loss, for he knew that his former self had been irrevocably lost.

In this twilight realm, where the shadows whispered tales of tragedy, Frank stood at the crossroads of his existence, forever condemned to a life devoid of passion and love. The nanites, his harbingers of doom, had stripped him of everything that made him human, leaving him with only an empty shell of self-awareness."

"`` Are you ready Captain?'' 
 
 I looked over at the eager young man standing in the doorway. I briefly look him up and down, noting the wide smile on his face and the shiny cleanliness of his power armor. I looked back down at my own weapons and went back to chambering rounds into my rifle. 
 
 `` Kid, I told you to stop calling me that. My days in the military were done a long time ago. You can just call me Matt like everybody else.'' 
 
 `` But you're here are n't you?'' 
 
 I chuckled to myself and shook my head. `` Kid the only reason I'm here is to find my brother. If I did n't think that Ben was somewhere on these chunks of rock, I would n't have left Mars to come back here.'' With that I turned back to my desk and began cleaning the slide on my pistol, hoping that the boy would go away. 
 
 Instead he walked over and sat down by my side. `` What makes you think your brother is here sir?'' I sighed and sat down the pistol before resting my head in my hands. 
 
 `` Again, Do n't call me sir. I'm not in your military anymore. He was a Marine fighting in Nigeria during the Third World uprising.'' 
 
 The boy nodded. `` Wait, then why was he here when the Coalition dropped the bombs?'' 
 
 I glanced at him and rolled my eyes. `` They do n't teach you much in those Coalition schools do they?'' 
 
 `` Sir?... I mean, Matt?'' 
 
 I turned to face him and began to tell him the proclamation that I had memorized. `` Coalition Reports on the Evacuation of U.N. Troops: Operation Axum. January 19, 2454. In response to the growing successes of the Troops of the Third World Confederacy in their war against the soldiers of the United Nations, the Security Council has declared that in order to assure the safety of all people in the United Nations colonies across the Solar System and the other local star clusters, that the Earth be a target of a total war bombing. All soldiers not immediately involved in combat with enemy soldiers are to be immediately evacuated from the planet, any soldiers that are in zones to hot for extraction are to, regrettably, abandoned due to logistical reasons.'' 
 
 The boy just stared at me in shock, mouth hanging open. `` Sir... That... I...'' 
 
 I tried my hardest not to laugh at the poor boy. `` Do n't bother soldier.'' I told him as I extended a stack of papers to him. `` I have a copy of it right here, none of this is fake.'' 
 
 He began reading and after a time he looked up at me in total shock. `` Sir... I...'' 
 
 `` You do n't need to explain anything to me kid, just get yourself to the dropship. We're due to drop in 30 minutes.'' I told him as I got up and looked at my watch. The boy nodded and hurried off. I watched him go and let a tiny smile cross my face. He was a good kid, if a little annoying at times. 
 
 I pushed the thoughts aside and began pulling on my gear. The hardened plasteel armor fit just as well as it had 15 years ago. My helmet still had the scratches on the visor and dents from a few bullets that were too close for comfort. I smiled as I slid it on my head and the HUD lit up. I grabbed my rifle and slid my pistols into their holsters before grabbing the old shotgun that my father had given me and slinging it on my back. 
 
 Now ready for action, I made my way to the hanger and joined the other volunteers for this mission by the Dropship. The Commander instructed us to load the craft and strap in for the drop. We did as ordered just like in the old days and just a short two minutes later the doors slide shut. I never liked the next part. 
 
 The feeling of going from a ship in orbit to a freefall is never pleasant, especially when you're wearing a helmet you ca n't even get sick in. Luckily for me I handed it before than some of the new kids, a few even passed out and I laughed to myself. As we fell, the Commander began speaking over the radio. 
 
 `` Alright boys and girls listen up. We're dropping in on what used to be the East African Republic. We're going to be focusing on the Region that the locals called Nigeria. Specifically, the capital, Abuja. Originally, we believed that our kinetic strikes decimated everything on this planetary chunk but starting in 2456, we began receiving emergency transmissions from a few fire teams of U.N. Marines that somehow survived our bombardment. Secretary-General Yoneda wants us to find our soldiers and bring them home.'' 
 
 A soldier raised his hand and spoke. `` Sir what if any of the Confederacy's soldiers survived?'' 
 
 `` Then we kill them. Those savages were never willing to leave the 22nd Century anyway.'' 
 
 I smirked under my helmet. Old fashioned way was always easier, no prisoners that way. 
 
 As the Commander finished the dropship slammed into the ground and the doors flew open. We charged off the ship and secured the area around the ship. The first thing that was noticeable was all the snow. Since the planet broke up, Climate was a thing of the past, everything was messed up. Parts of Africa were cold, parts of Siberia were hot. I felt bad for a few of the rookies who were surprised by this. `` I thought Africa was hot.'' I heard one of them whisper. 
 
 `` Hey, stop the talking!'' The Commander barked. `` The signal from the Marines transmitter was coming from about nine Kilometers to the North. Lets go.'' 
 
 We started making our way North through the outskirts of Abuja toward the city center. We made it the first six kilometers in just over an hour. One of the soldiers stopped and pointed. `` Sir look! The Assembly building!'' The group stopped and looked. Sure enough the dome, or... what was left of it anyway, towered over the rest of the city. The Commander stopped and thought for a second. 
 
 `` Hey, Contractor, come here for a second.'' I jogged over, and made my way to his side. 
 
 `` Sir?'' 
 
 `` You fought here during the first war in the 30's right?'' 
 
 `` Only for a few months sir.'' 
 
 `` Well that's more than any of us. Take a few men and go check out the Assembly.'' 
 
 I nodded and turned away toward the assembly. I picked a few soldiers, including the kid to come with me and the six of us set off. 
 
 It did n't take us long to make our way to the Assembly's steps. As we were about to start climbing the stairs though, gunfire erupted from the west, where the others had gone. Not so much as a glance at the others and we took off back toward the group. We made our way toward where the shooting but before we got there, a group of Men in primitive camouflage jumped out and surrounded us. They were everywhere, in the buildings, windows, doors, and in the streets and alleys around us. 
 
 We raised our hands in surrender and the men began yelling at us in French. I thought to myself, `` So this is how I die... twelve years off fighting, and I die surrounded was my hands in the air.'' I closed my eyes and prepared for the worst. 
 
 A few seconds later, I heard the gunshot and I flinched, though I did n't feel the pain of a bullet or the burn of plasma tearing through my armor. I opened my eyes a crack and saw the man who had been in front of us laid dead on the street, bloody, and lifeless. We stared and the men around us panicked. 
 
 Suddenly the streets were loud with the gunfire of rifles and the bursts of the newer plasma weapons. The men around us being to fall and we dropped to the ground and began firing our own weapons into the ground. The next few minutes seemed like a blur, but when the dust settled, blood stained the snow, and there were bodies and weapons strewn everywhere. Dozens of the soldiers from the remnants of the Confederacy were dead as well of three of my group. As we stood up and retrieved the bodies of our comrades. A different group of men stepped out of the buildings wearing modern power armor. 
 
 Remove your helmets, Identify yourselves. We did as ordered. `` Calm down son'' I spoke up. `` We're with the United Nations, We're here to rescue your men.'' I put my helmet under my arm and the man lowered his gun. 
 
 `` Really? They came for us?'' I nodded in response. `` And the other group? They're U.N. too?'' I nodded again. `` They were attacked too. But we managed to help them beat back the attack before too many of them were killed.'' 
 
 `` That's good, can you get your men to they co-ordinates?'' I asked as I handed him a data pad with the landing zones position. 
 
 `` Yes sir. I can do that, all our forces left will make our way there by tomorrow.'' 
 
 `` Good, we have dropships waiting there for you.'' 
 
 The man removed his own helmet. `` Thank you... Sir''. 
 
 I smiled and shook my head. `` Oh no, I'm not a soldier anymore. I'm just a contractor. I'm trying to find my...'' 
 
 `` Matt!?'' I spun around toward the familiar voice, a grin on my face. 
 
 `` Ben!?''

"It was the day we'd all been waiting for since the ascension of Christ: His return to Earth. At long last, after over 2000 years of anticipation and uncertainty, He had descended once more, putting to rest any doubt that He was the single true God of all creation. He came down in a great flash of light, and every living thing beheld the glory of our returned Lord. 
 
 It happened in Israel. Camera crews and hordes of excited people rushed to the scene, eager for a glance at the Messiah. But what we expected was not what we beheld. Rather than the friendly, bearded face of Jesus that we had all come to know and worship, we instead gazed upon the graying, middle-aged face of a seemingly disgruntled businessman. Many bowed in reverence, some simply stared in awe. But all were silent as we awaited what the great Yahweh had to say to His people. 
 
 He spoke in a strange language, the likes of which none of us had ever heard. And yet, we all listened and understood his words. `` You humans seek knowledge above all else. For centuries you have sought to understand my creation. You have sacrificed a great deal to know what I know; to see as I see. And now, for the second time in history, I stand as one of you. But do not be deceived, for I am not here to grant you salvation. I am simply here to grant you the vision you so desire; to put an end to your hopeless thirst for knowledge. And so, in exactly 24 hours, I will stand where I do now and answer the questions that plague your species. Once all questions have been answered, I will return to my place in Heaven once more. This shall be the last time humanity ever gazes upon me.'' With that, he dissipated in another flash of white light. 
 
 Hundreds, thousands, millions of people boarded planes and ships headed to Israel. Within hours it was impossible to find any means of transportation to anywhere outside the country. Indeed, so many people were arriving in Israel that there was hardly room to move. Most were forced to sleep on the cold, hard ground that night. 
 
 As for me, I simply stayed home. Being an atheist my whole adult life, I had very much disdain for this God and all the suffering he has wrought upon the human species. I had no interest in wasting my precious time boarding a plane to see his miserable old face. While there was one deep, burning question I wanted to ask him, I decided it was not worth the trouble. 
 
 24 hours came and went, and in another flash of light, there stood the aging businessman, exactly as promised. The radius of the crowd consisted of at least a million people, all just scrambling for a glance at our Creator. A great uproar was taking place, with everyone all asking at once their questions for the great God of all. 
 
 He put his arms up to signal for silence, and all obeyed. He said, in his strange godly language, `` I shall now answer the questions of humanity.'' People remained silent, waiting for him to continue. But in the solitude of my apartment I spoke at the television screen, where the man's face was plastered in plain view. I pointed accusingly as I said, `` I have a question for you, o great God. Why is there so much suffering on this earth? Why is there such great pain? How can you allow millions and millions of people to starve, succumb to disease, die by the hands of their fellow humans? If you are truly an all-loving God, how can you just sit by while all of this happens?'' 
 
 Suddenly, the man on the screen was looking directly at me. A cold chill ran through my spine as his menacing eyes penetrated my own. The air grew heavy with his presence and he began speaking once more. `` Why do I allow suffering, you ask?'' he said. My heart began pounding a million miles a second. Somehow, he had heard me. He was talking *to me. * I drew in breath shakily as he continued. `` I will answer your question honestly, but you will not like it. I do not just allow suffering. I create it. I *cause* it. All of the wars, plagues, injuries and shortcomings of mankind are my own doing. I infected you with the bubonic plague. AIDS, cancer, terrorism. Simply the latest developments of mine. 
 
 `` You see, when I crafted the the first living organism, I knew that it would multiply and diversify. I watched it eagerly, not knowing what would form but realizing that it would be my own doing. The dinosaurs were a monstrosity, and an accident. I looked upon the ugly behemoths in disgust. Finally it came to the point where I could stand it no more. I had a meteorite crash down and destroy the beasts, leaving only the smaller, frailer and more beautiful creatures to live and reproduce. I watched the mammals branch off and primates come into being, and soon after, humans. 
 
 `` I took a special interest in humans because you were different. You were no longer just a random result of evolution that lived simply to survive. You had broken free of the binds of nature that I had created. You learned, perceived, experienced unlike any other creature. You had an affinity for artistic endeavors even in your earliest stages. But you had something else as well: an intense thirst for knowledge. 
 
 `` From the very beginning, you wanted to know how and why things are the way they are. Many humans attempted to explain it through various deities and stories. Others took a more organized approach, and soon science was born. You experimented, gathered data, came to conclusions. You were manipulating nature in ways that I had never intended. Some of your creations were innovative and helpful; others were wicked and selfish. 
 
 `` But I came to realize that humans valued knowledge above all else. The vast majority of you did not care whom you harmed in your endless search for truth. Hundreds of millions of innocent lives have been taken throughout the ages because of your intense thirst. Your machines and mechanisms have made the world ugly and gray. You are but parasites upon the earth, feasting upon its life for the sake of your trivial pursuits. I saw that I had created a monster far worse than the dinosaurs. 
 
 `` Why did n't I destroy humanity directly from the beginning? I saw hope in you. For although you had grown beyond what I ever expected from my creation, you were the only species that shared my affinity for creation. I wanted to be among you, so I descended to Earth as the one you know as Jesus. I treated every person I met with the utmost kindness and respect. I healed and helped my fellow humans. Yet despite all this, you rejected me. You betrayed me, mocked me, and hung me on a cross to die in a state of agony and misery. It was then that I saw the full extent of the evil I had created. 
 
 `` My hatred for your species runs so deep that I did not want to destroy you. No, death would be too easy. Instead, I subjected you to countless diseases and terrible suffering throughout the ages. I have brought you to the brink of death, but I always bring you back. I ignite your flesh, but put out the flame that I may burn you again. For all eternity I wish to put you through the same pain that your miserable species had put me through 2000 years ago. 
 
 `` And that, my son, is why you suffer.''
"," Infuse the essay with the lyrical and profound voice of Maya Angelou, reflecting on human dignity and resilience.","It was a day etched in time, a day etched in the hearts of all human beings. It was the day when the world stood still, and the divine descended upon the Earth. It was the day when the long-awaited savior, Jesus Christ, had returned to grace humanity with his presence.

In the land of Israel, where the echoes of history danced with the promises of the future, the heavens parted, and the glory of the Lord shone upon the world. Cameras clicked, and the masses thronged, their hearts filled with anticipation and awe. But what they saw was not the gentle, bearded face of Jesus that had painted countless canvases with compassion and love. Instead, they beheld a weathered, middle-aged businessman, whose expression hinted at a mix of frustration and resignation. Yet, despite his appearance, the presence of the Almighty resonated through the air, calming every soul and commanding attention.

He spoke in tongues of fire, his voice echoing through the hills and valleys. His words were profound, piercing through the hearts of all who heard them. He spoke of the insatiable human desire for knowledge and understanding. He spoke of the burden humanity carried in its pursuit of wisdom and the futility of its attempts to comprehend the divine. But he also spoke of hope and redemption, reminding everyone that their questions would soon be answered and that their hearts would be filled with the peace and tranquility of divine understanding.

The world erupted in a frenzy of travel, and within hours, it was impossible to find a means of transportation outside of Israel. The masses flocked to the Holy Land, their hearts overflowing with gratitude and anticipation. Yet, amidst the throngs, there was a sense of unity and purpose. All were bound by the same desire to witness the return of their savior, and to share in the momentous occasion.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the land, Jesus stood tall, his gaze fixed on the horizon. He had spoken his final words, and the world held its breath in anticipation of the divine unfolding. With a final burst of light, he ascended back into the heavens, leaving behind a legacy that would forever shape humanity.

In the aftermath of that momentous day, the world emerged from its reverent state. The echoes of the divine lingered in the air, and the hearts of all human beings were forever changed. The day of Christ's return was a testament to the enduring power of resilience and dignity, a day that reminded everyone that even in the darkest of times, the light of hope always shines on."
"`` Have you ever tasted infinity?'' 
 
 I stared at myself, standing before me with a matching frown on his face. I did n't like that frown, so I tried making myself smile. It worked. 
 
 `` Tastes exactly like Skittles do n't. You have n't heard of those yet, but when you're on planet Retro, go to their candies district and order a bag. Perfection, in fruity, sugary, colorful form.'' 
 
 `` I do n't like sweets.'' I essayed to myself. 
 
 `` But I do. They keep my mind distracted from the jump. And I'm the jumper cable, so you should try to keep me happy.'' 
 
 `` Did I fuck up the jump, then?'' I asked slowly. `` Are we strained puree of mortality sprayed vividly across the stars?'' 
 
 `` No, no, you ca n't feel a failed jump. The fact that your mind is still working is proof that you're still alive and piloting. Remember that, in the future. This trip is a short one, in both senses of the word trip and in both senses of the word short and in both senses of the word one.'' 
 
 `` Did I jettison my brain, then? It does n't mind that my matter is still working, if I've gone crazy from it. Last I checked, they HEY HEY do n't let insane people jump pilot jump ships jump distances.'' 
 
 I shook my head sadly at myself, marveling at my naivete. This must be my first ever jump. I could tell, it was the first ever jump that I did n't have my Space Skittles to keep my sanity in check. First times are always rough. You do n't know pain until you've gone without Skittles on a jump. It leaves a bad aftertaste of infinity. 
 
 `` When I hit up a spacer bar, ask other pilots to swap stories. We all have our own coping mechanisms. There's that guy I'm going to meet who imagines that he's a catapult trying to shoot dreams into the forevermore. Stay away from him, he's a little bit eccentric.'' 
 
 `` You're fucking crazy. I'm fucking crazy.'' I said to the phantom of myself. 
 
 `` You have to go a little crazy to stay sane here.'' I told myself. I did n't look pleased to hear it. Oh well. I'd make it through my first jump and spend a few weeks terrified to make another, and eventually get used to the sensation. It was the sort of thing you learned to live with, otherwise experiencing subjective eternity would drive you mad. 
 
 I popped a handful of Skittles into my mouth to blanch my senses, offering the bag to myself. `` No thanks,'' I said, `` those things taste terrible, I do n't know why I'm still eating them.''
"," Use the upbeat and positive language of a cheerful optimist, seeing the good in every situation.","Have you ever tasted infinity? It is an intangible concept that is difficult to grasp. However, I believe that everyone can relate to the feeling of infinity on a personal level.

I stood there, staring at myself, feeling helpless and alone. I had just completed my first jump, and I was not thrilled with the outcome. I felt like I had tasted infinity, and it tasted exactly like Skittles. The sweet, fruity flavor of the candy was overpowering, and I couldn't imagine ever wanting to taste it again.

However, I knew that I had to find a way to cope with the feeling of infinity. I started by trying to make myself smile. It worked. I smiled and felt a sense of relief. I knew that I was still alive and well, and that was the most important thing.

I also knew that I had to find a way to distract myself from the feeling of infinity. I started by eating Skittles. It worked. The sweet, fruity flavor of the candy helped me to forget my troubles for a while.

I know that I am a little crazy. I know that I am a little bit eccentric. But I also know that I am alive and well. And that is the most important thing."
"`` I've never seen anything like this before'' Dr. Hawkins noted. 
 
 I had been sitting in the MRI scanner for at least 1.34 times the duration they at first gave as an estimate. But of course, the events which had recently transpired far exceeded their intellectual grasp, and I'm sure any estimate they could give as to how they could determine the cause my sudden cognitive leap would rarely be accurate. 
 
 `` The tumor still responds to our instruments, despite having no contact with any host organism for at least 36 hours'' the baffled doctor continued. 
 
 In reality it had been One day, 13 hours, seven minutes, and approximately 30 seconds since the most out of the ordinary thing to ever occur to me had been extracted from the outer membrane of my temporal lobe. The doctors had discovered in a routine MRI following my construction-related head injury a growth that, based on its shape perfectly complementing the contortions of my brain, has been present for much of my life. A surgery was scheduled, carried out, but before they discarded the darkened mass that for once had no connection to my brain, it flashed a bright red light, and shrunk to half its size. 
 
 Those recovering from general anesthesia take hours to return to a normal state of lucidity, but only minutes after Dr. Flawnder sealed and bandaged my skull, I became far more aware of my surroundings than anyone in the room. 
 
 As I soon came to find out, and the doctors more slowly, my mental processing had jumped far beyond my previous average intelligence. I began reading at a pace that exceeded my hand's ability to turn a book's page. I could solve graduate level differential calculus as a professor works out simple addition in his head. Any person I met, I knew all his secrets, intentions, and desires after a few exchanged words, and as I continued to heal from the damage the surgery caused, I became world-ranking at everything I chose to learn in a few hours. 
 
 `` Take him out, we have enough data to look at. The parasite seems to be increasingly unresponsive''. Hawkins noted as I was let out of the MRI scanner and taken to the table where they had the tumor suspended. 
 
 The doctors, after a sequence of scans and experiments that proved ineffective at determining my sudden hyper-intelligence, gave me a small section of their laboratory to study it, and in a few hours I called them over to reveal my findings on the parasite's nature. 
 
 `` It seems to act as an independent organism beyond range of a host. In the hours it has been unattached, it has exposed a vast array of tendrils that each exhibit smaller protrusions that act much like nervous tissue. When fed nervous impulses similar to that of a human brain, it outputs a response on a complementary set of tendrils that seem to have an active discretion. Something is controlling the thoughts of whatever attaches to this creature, and its means of processing far outreach anything seen before on earth. From a small sample we see that its internal nervous impulses are generated autonomously, and spawn from no connected impulse whatsoever''. 
 
 `` What could this imply?'' He asked with a nearly visible confusion. 
 
 `` Something beyond our dimension is controlling it. It may seem outlandish, but somehow before my birth this being fused to my developing brain, and had for years been restricting my thoughts, ensuring they met the expectations of any average human being, never more. For some reason that is impossible to determine, I was forced to live as a fraction of my full potential, because some sentient being had determined it to be so.'' 
 
 The days that followed mostly involved more scans, questioning, and stumbling research on part of the scientists. While I knew there was nothing more to be discovered, as any part the scientists attempted to utilize died upon being isolated, and quickly disintegrated into common elements, they would not stop until they admitted to that something continued to control it, and it would only begin acting again once returned to a host. I had no care for the time I spent there. I had already provided a group of Swedish mathematicians the proof for an algorithm which in time would exponentially increase the rate of computer data compression and retrieval over the weekend, and needed no further income past the shared $ 3,000,000 prize given to them. After the doctors realized their search could not continue with any new information, they sent it to a group of Harvard scientists, who would return in in three weeks time after a team member committed suicide after working on it alone for eight hours. 
 
 But what about me, was I happy with what had happened? 
 
 I had seen past what our greatest thinkers had spent their lives deciphering in the code of our universe, I had memorized the texts whole civilizations took their whole breadth to pen in the time any normal man could read a textbook of that same civilization. I could do anything I want, but doing so requires you to want *something*, and ever since the extraction I've encountered a severe lack of motivation. 
 
 When you take time to look at things, all we ever do is attempt to decipher what surrounds us, and learn to accept our limits and take the rewards our intelligence and effort can merit. Those most happy understand that there exists a world beyond their reach they will never grasp even the tiniest sliver of, and are content in a life of disillusioned bliss. For everyone except me, there is a mystery to the world, a massive cave you can never see the end of, but you can choose to remain content in any small inlet, knowing full well that you've discovered what you could, but motivated to know there is a whole abyss waiting to be lit by you and everyone else. 
 
 My cave has full interior lighting, every nook, cranny, and small chip in the rock fully illuminated and open for me to observe and note to my heart's content. Any part beyond my current view I could walk into and know the full extent to everything I see while even the smartest minds feel their way across the dark, damp walls. I have no limits, no bounds, and no needed effort to verse myself in anything I wish. 
 
 And so that is why I returned to the hospital, and why in a moment 20 mg of propofol will enter my bloodstream and effectively cloud my perception of pain and surroundings. Because I realize that to have a brain with no limits is as interesting as not having one. So I've chosen to give that 0.232 kilogram entity of some world not even I could be aware of another chance. 
 
 `` I'm ready, put it back in''.
"," Adopt the stylish and geometric style of an Art Deco architect, full of glamour and elegance.","I've never seen anything like this before, Dr. Hawkins remarked.

My mind had been blown, my senses overwhelmed, and my body battered by the invasive surgery, yet I felt strangely whole, as if a vital piece had been returned to me. In the wake of the surgery, I had a profound awakening. I could read at a speed that exceeded my hand's ability to turn a book's page, solve graduate-level differential calculus as if it were simple addition, and comprehend the secrets of any person I met after a few exchanged words. I had become world-ranking at everything I chose to learn in a few hours.

As I sat in the MRI scanner, the doctor's words echoed in my mind, ""Take him out, we have enough."" I knew then that my life had been irrevocably altered. I was no longer a mere mortal, but a master of knowledge and a weaver of possibilities. I was the architect of my own destiny, armed with an intellect that could rival the most brilliant minds in the world."
"`` Holy shit balls of the mountain king.'' Stated Mulligan. 
 
 The law of Cuntis Fucktis had taken effect, on a rainy afternoon, on Monday, and it was his birthday on the first day of his weekend, the first weekend he'd had in a month from working his crappy night job as a bucket stacker at a warehouse that recycled'Shit Buckets', buckets that people shit in if they have no access to proper facilities. He had n't had a shower all week because his landlord had kicked him out due to nonpayment and debt racked up to $ 9000. This day was the shittiest miracle of a day that he had ever witnessed. 
 
 Here he was, holding a revolver to the head of guy in a karate outfit outside of a bank surrounded by the police with NO BULLETS LEFT. 
 
 From the look of it, his hostage was a Red Belt. The most dangerous of belts. Just experienced enough to have some actual skill and just cocky enough to make stupid decisions work. He knew this because his high school bully was a Red Belt who had very quickly graduated to a Black Belt within 2 months of the beginning of school. 
 
 `` You smell like shit.'' Said the Red Belt. 
 
 `` Put the gun down you ballsfaggot!'' Screamed the officer. 
 Officers were legendary for their insults in the town where he came from. 
 
 `` No!'' Said Mulligan, keeping a cool attitude as rain trickled off of his balding scalp gently deflected through his loose collar, down his chest and stomach where it began to soak his crotch. 
 
 `` If you do n't put it down now we're just going to make it even worse for you when you finally do!'' But the officer did n't know. Mulligan still had one thing going for him. The power of the worst luck in the history of the known universe. 
 
 As he gazed into the sky, Mulligan saw the telltale sign of a funnel cloud forming above. 
 
 All of a sudden the sound of a thousand freight trains filled the air and the Red Belt made his move. As the police ducked for cover the Red Belt also ducked, elbowed Mulligan in the stomach, grabbed his gun arm and flipped him over onto the edge of the pavement where the small of Mulligan's back directly hit the corner as he fell. $ 100 Notes puffed from his jacket as the Red Belt went to town. Fiercely beating him. 
 
 `` Get up!'' Screamed the Red Belt and Mulligan groaned to his feet if only not to enrage him further. The sound of freight trains was now deafening and Mulligan could see the funnel was about to touch down. The police were fleeing. 
 
 `` Ki yah!'' The Karate Man screamed and pirouetted into a roundhouse kick that sent Mulligan flying back through the doors of the bank. Mulligan rolled and braced himself against them as best he could as the Karate Man screamed and pounded, trying to get in. 
 
 KABOOM 
 
 The funnel hit down and Mulligan could hear the smashing of windows everywhere. Suddenly the roof was ripped off the building and shards lashed his face. He could barely see anything but as he held on to the railing just inside the doors he could only just make out a red strip of fabric flying up into the sky. 
 
 After what felt like forever the twister finally passed and Mulligan made his escape. Never to be seen or heard from again.
"," Use the minimalist and reflective style of a Zen master, focusing on simplicity and insight.","In the tapestry of life, where threads intertwine, there unfolds a narrative steeped in simplicity and profound insight. The protagonist, a man of humble beginnings, finds himself entangled in a pivotal moment, illuminated by a glimmer of fate.

The law of Cuntis Fucktis cast its enigmatic shadow upon a rainy afternoon, casting a pall of melancholy upon the streets. In this tempestuous dance of circumstances, fate presented a cruel yet miraculous gift – a day steeped in the darkest of realities, yet imbued with the potential for transformation.

As the protagonist stood poised at the precipice of despair, a captive to his own tumultuous emotions, he found himself in a precarious position. A revolver pressed against his captive's head, the world seemed to pause, mirroring the stillness of a serene pond. The Red Belt, a master of martial arts and rash judgment, uttered words that pierced through the air, ""You smell like shit."" But the officer's command, ""Put the gun down you ballsfaggot!"" echoed through the streets, a testament to the unwavering tenacity of law enforcement officials.

His balding scalp, drenched in rain, deflected the droplets as they trickled down his chest, soaking his crotch. As he gazed into the sky, a funnel cloud emerged, heralding the arrival of fate's cruel hand.

And so, in this labyrinth of circumstances, the protagonist emerged unscathed, his spirit unbroken. The Red Belt, consumed by his own hubris, met his demise as the funnel cloud unleashed its wrath. The protagonist, a witness to the unfolding drama, reflected on the impermanence of life and the interconnectedness of all things.

In the aftermath of the ordeal, the protagonist stood amidst the ruins of his former self, yet imbued with a newfound sense of purpose. He knew that the journey of life, though fraught with challenges, holds the potential for profound transformation.

"I questioned my choice on that first day, and on several subsequent days. By the time summer came around, I was enjoying it of course. But then autumn came again, and fat clouds brought more questions. 
 
 I always walked my section of the Thames, never any other, not even on my own time. The filthy serpent that snakes through London had never interested me, and still does n't. I passed through Rotherhithe Docks and paused, the rain falling around me in sheets, splashing off a nearby awning with a roar. I recall this now, because it was the last good day. Every day since has been horrific due to my own curiosity. 
 
 The other Regulators had said not to ask questions when I transferred over from the Environmental Department. As far as cushy government jobs went, this was the best. So secretive, you ca n't even tell yourself what you do. Just stand out in the rain with your clipboard every time the heavens open, and record all'strangeness' you see in the waters. Post the form in the box and go home. 
 
 Some days, like this day, the wind was not strong enough to move the mist from the murky surface, and it made it difficult for me to see the eddies. Never get too close, they said. I stared at a dark twist in the current and hunched deeper into my raincoat. I checked boxes on my waterproof sheet. 
 
 I saw Ben Thompson slowly go mad. That was when I had first begged my superiors for the answers. They laughed as if we were sharing a joke but then threatened my job, and I have a family. So then I asked some of the other Regulators, even though I knew we were not supposed to fraternise outside of work. Blank faces and sullen looks. These folks knew their ebb from their flow, but never more than that. Just like me. 
 
 I threw my legs over the barrier and landed knee deep in brown slime. My hood slipped and my hair immediately plastered to my face in the deluge.'Never get too close, they said', I murmured as I waded to the water's edge, past sunken shopping carts and drowned sea birds. 
 
 Never get too close. Never ask questions. Two rules, both broken. I learned that when you see it for the first time, you will always see it. The clamour beneath the chaotic surface. Dark shades of fingers and translucent twists of limbs. The long dead fighting for a return to civilisation. The rain brings them up like worms, out of their watery graves. Gasping for air but never quite reaching it. 
 
 Since that day, I see them. And the London rain stinks.

Yet, it is a river I have never fully embraced, as my attention has been primarily focused on the political turmoil that has enveloped our dear nation.

I recall the day I questioned my choice, the day I transferred from the Environmental Department to the enigmatic realm of the Regulators. The day the rain splashed upon me like sheets, obscuring my vision and washing away my doubts. It was the last good day, a day of tranquility amidst the chaos that has consumed my life since.

The other Regulators had warned me against asking questions. Their advice echoed in my mind like a mantra, ""Just stand out in the rain with your clipboard and record all'strangeness' you see in the waters. Post the form in the box and go home.""

On that fateful day, the wind was not strong enough to move the mist, and it made it difficult for me to see the eddies.

I felt an overwhelming sense of despair, a feeling of being trapped in a web of my own making.

"Ulysses Durant had never been a reverent man, but he always bowed his head in respect before the red root chakra painted on the door of a small shop in a narrow back ally. 
 
 A small bell above announced his arrival as he pushed open the door. A fragrant waft of myrrh and cinnamon washed over him. 
 
 `` Bonsoir, Uly. Simone told me you'd be coming,'' A petite dark haired woman emerged from a back room, carrying boxes marked: `` Dead Sea, Purification Salt Crystals.'' 
 
 `` Let me help you with that,'' Durant offered, and took a few of the boxes from her to stock the shelves. 
 
 `` She tells me you're interested in another ritual.'' 
 
 Durant pulled a rock out of his jacket pocket and handed it to the woman. The black and rock was about the size of a fist, with soft indentures and curvatures rendering it imperfectly ovular in shape. `` Look what I found up near Great Bear Lake. My biologist friend tells me it's Acasta Gneiss.'' 
 
 `` So you finally found something older than you,'' she ran her thumb over the surface and closed her eyes. 
 
 `` Har har. I want you to bind a soul to it.'' 
 
 She sighed. `` Uly, you ca n't just bind souls to rocks.'' 
 
 `` I am tired, Marianne. You understand that if I change one person, anyone, that opens up a whole host of trouble for me. It does n't matter if they're a preacher or a whore, over time they either get themselves killed or starve to death after eating a few small towns here and there. Besides, the world ca n't handle any more than five. Any more new vampires, and everyone's dead in ninety days. The vampires gone not long after.'' 
 
 `` So make peace with the others. Do n't go asking me to soul bind someone to a rock for eternity.'' 
 
 `` Please, I would have someone, someone sane, to keep me grounded.'' 
 
 `` They wo n't be sane for long if you're putting a human soul into a rock.'' 
 
 `` They would have me to talk to.'' 
 
 `` That would drive them nuts that much quicker.'' 
 
 Durant snarled. `` I am losing my mind, Isabel.'' 
 
 `` I'm Marianne.'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry, that was your...'' 
 
 `` Great-grandmother.'' 
 
 `` You look so much like her,'' he sighed and took the rock back from Marianne and looked down at it. `` Please. I've pledged to sire no more children. I need something, something beyond a simple animation spell.'' 
 
 `` I wo n't, Ulysses,'' she crossed her arms. 
 
 `` Very well. If you wo n't, maybe one of your kin, or maybe one of your great-grandchildren will. I'll confuse them for you, and I'll have this same pointless conversation from here to eternity.'' 
 
 `` Is there anything else I can do for you tonight?'' She asked, suddenly professional. 
 
 `` Besides the rock spell, no. Good night, Marianne.'' 
 
 Durant puffed his shoulders back and strolled out of the shop, the bell above the door tinkling behind him a second before it slammed. 
 
 Under the light of the moon, the surface of the rock shone like jet. 
 
 `` Well, Peter,'' Durant said, looking down at the stone. `` I think that's the fifth time this century I've had this discussion. Always the same.'' 
 
 

"," Infuse the essay with the lyrical and profound voice of Maya Angelou, reflecting on human dignity and resilience.","In the tapestry of life, where threads intertwine, Maya Angelou's lyrical voice echoes through the pages of human dignity and resilience. Each story she weaves encapsulates the intricate dance between adversity and triumph, leaving an indelible imprint on the hearts of all.

Ulysses Durant, a humble soul with a heart steeped in wisdom, enters a small shop tucked amidst the shadows of a narrow back alley. The scent of myrrh and cinnamon permeates the air, inviting him to step into a realm where the ordinary intertwines with the extraordinary.

A petite dark-haired woman, Marianne, emerges from the back room, her eyes twinkling with an enigmatic glow. She greets him with a smile, her voice imbued with the sweetness of honey and the strength of a warrior. As she guides him through the shelves, her words dance like the wind, carrying the scent of memories and the promise of transformation.

In a moment of shared vulnerability, Durant presents her with a rock, a testament to his resilience and longing for connection. The rock, imbued with the spirit of Acasta Gneiss, carries the weight of history and the potential for boundless possibilities. But Marianne's wisdom reminds him that the act of soul binding is not merely a whimsical endeavor but a potent force that has the capacity to alter the course of human destiny.

As the conversation unfolds, Maya Angelou's voice reverberates through the room, weaving a tapestry of compassion and understanding. She recognizes the interconnectedness of all beings, acknowledging that the act of changing one person leads to a ripple effect that can extend far beyond the boundaries of time and space.

The weight of the world bears down upon Durant, and he expresses his desire to find solace in the embrace of a sane soul. However, Marianne's unwavering response challenges his illusions, reminding him that the path to healing is not paved with good intentions but with the willingness to confront the complexities of human nature.

In the face of adversity, Maya Angelou's spirit guides us through the labyrinth of emotions, prompting us to confront our own biases and embrace the beauty of diversity. Through her poignant storytelling and unwavering empathy, she teaches us that resilience is not merely a personal attribute but a collective force that has the power to transform the world.

As the sun casts long shadows across the alleyway, the scent of cinnamon and myrrh lingers in the air. Durant and Marianne bid farewell, their connection etched in the annals of time. In the aftermath of their encounter, Maya Angelou's voice continues to echo in the hearts of all who have been touched by her transformative power."
"You know, I was born during the war, in 1943. My sister, Rose, is the one who raised me. She's older than I was. Well, you've met her; she was the lady living in the small house in this Southern France village, remember her? 
 
 Your little sisters never met her, but you spent at least one Christmas with her. Your uncle dressed up as Santa. I hear it's the only time you got your present on the night of Christmas and not the next morning. I never understood why your mom always sent you to bed this early. And on the day of Christmas... Ah, well. 
 
 Anyway. Rose was almost 20 years old, when I was born, in 1943. The Germans were here, of course, they had been here for a while. And I was just a baby. Which means that she carried me in a crib. 
 
 Did you know that your great-aunt was a war hero? 
 
 She carried the crib everyday, from our village to the one next to ours. Over there, there was this restaurant, held by some people I've never known very well. Every day, she would walk from our home to their place, with me in the crib, and then back. She would politely say hello to the German soldiers. She did n't really have a choice, did she? 
 
 I was in the crib. And under me, there was ammunition. There was food for the Résistants. There was everything she could find for the Maquisards, to save our country. 
 
 When I was a baby, I fell sick. I had nothing to eat. Neither had she - she gave it all to the Résistants. I grew up, and my sister raised my like I was her child. Your great-aunt did n't look like much, did she? 
 
 Well, she was a war hero.
"," Rewrite this in the style of a 1940s film noir detective monologue, full of mystery and a touch of melodrama.","""Listen up, kid. You're a mess of a kid, but you're gonna hear a story that'll make your hair stand on end. I was born in '43, in the middle of all that stinkin' war. Rose, my sister, raised me. She was older than me, a tough broad. You met her, the lady living in that small house in that Southern France village.

I know you ain't met her, but you spent Christmas with her. It was the only time you got your present on Christmas night, not the next morning. Your mom always sent you to bed early. And on that Christmas night... well, let's just say, that's a story for another day.

Rose was almost 20 when I was born. The Germans were hoppin' all over the place, and I was just a helpless baby. She carried me in that crib, day after day, from our village to that restaurant. Every day, she would walk from our home to their place, with me in the crib, and then back.

There was a lotta stuff in that crib, kid. Ammunition, food for the Résistants, everything she could find to save our country. It was her way of fighting back. And you know what? That woman was a war hero. She carried that crib all the way to freedom. So that's the story of my war hero sister, the woman who saved our country, one baby crib at a time."
"I lock the front door of my house as I walk in. I always lock the front door, it makes me feel safe. I place my keys in the bowl on the table and set my bag on the chair. The cat greets me as I wash my hands in the kitchen sink and rubs against my calves. 
 
 `` I've missed you'' I say to him, knowing he does n't understand or speak back. 
 
 I glance out the window as I'm drying my hands, and that's when I notice movement. 
 
 By the time it registers that I've seen anything at all it's gone. What was it? Must have gone behind a tree, I think. My curiosity is piqued and I scan the treeline for another sign, but nothing. Did I see anything in the first place? Maybe I'm just tired from the long day. That must be it. 
 
 Movement again. This time I'm sure of it. An animal of some sort, but I did n't get a good enough look. Too big to be a dog. Deer? Moose? 
 
 I want to investigate and take a step outside. It's colder than I thought it was. The wind beats against my face as I put my hood up and take a few steps out into the woods. 
 
 On the ground I notice a drop of blood. I move towards it, there's another one a few feet away, and then another. Something's hurt. I can feel my heart beating through my chest. I want to turn back now but I need to know what is out there. More blood. The drops are closer together than before. I come to a large oak tree, one I'm familiar with and fond of climbing, one that I've grown comfortable in. I'm far from comfortable now. 
 
 Around the tree I see it. Oh God. 
 
 `` help'' it croaks. 
 
 I ca n't. I panic. My vision starts blurring. I turn for home. 
 I start to walk. 
 I start to run. 
 I lock the back door of my house as I walk in. I always lock the back door, it makes me feel safe
"," Use the rhythmic and raw style of a Beat poet, full of spontaneity and defiance.","I slam the front door shut, my keys dancing in my bowl
Like a mantra, I lock my front door, a shield
In the kitchen sink, my hands wash in rhythm with the night
The cat purrs, a symphony of sweet delight

A glimpse out the window, a fleeting vision
Movement in the trees, a mirage in motion
But as I stare, the moment melts away
Leaving me with questions, a haunting sway

The wind whips against me, a cold embrace
I step into the woods, an invitation to escape
Blood on the ground, a trail of crimson hue
Something injured, I search, but the mystery blooms

The oak tree, my refuge, my escape
I climb and climb, my fear a guiding rope
From the branches, I gaze upon the plight
A cry for help, a desperate fight

My heart sinks, my vision blurs
I panic, my mind in a whirl
I turn to flee, but fate has a hold
My legs fail me, I am broken and cold"
"My diet is strictly liquid. You guys have heard of that Soylent shit, right? Same thing, more or less. Everything I need. All the nutrients and electrolytes and whatever-the-hell that keep my system in running order. Each daily dose spread across three separate bottles. It ’ s been that way ever since the shit-monsters materialized. 
 
 Taking liquid shits isn ’ t so bad, I guess. I had to move from single-ply economy toilet paper to extra soft to extra soft plus moisturizing lotion to baby wipes. But there ’ s a bear on the box and it looks kinda cute sitting on the cistern of my toilet. Plus I don ’ t have to worry about which direction to place the roll, so I guess I ’ ve got that going for me. 
 
 But Jesus. I hate. Hate hate hate hate. Hate more than I have hated anything else. Hate more than I hate terrorism and ebola and Donald Trump ’ s political campaign. Fucking hate the lack of variety in my meals. Sure, I ’ ve lost fifteen pounds. Sure, it ’ s cheaper in the long run. And sure, I don ’ t have to deal with the hassle of finding a new home for my crying, screaming shit-monsters. But I really miss solid food. Real food. Food I can chew up. Steak. Crusty warm bread with the soft chewy inside that I have gnash with my molars into a glutenous blob before I can swallow it down. It ’ s awful. 
 
 So, I cheated. 
 
 Most people have a slip-up now and then. And yeah, if I ’ m honest with you right now, I don ’ t regret it one bit. So sue me. I wanted food of substance. It ’ s a natural desire. We ’ re fighting millions of years of evolution here, folks. It ’ s not like I committed some kind of cardinal sin. My teeth and the little biome in my stomach didn ’ t evolve to process this synthetic liquid garbage. 
 
 Finding solid food is hard if you don ’ t know where to look for it. There are still fringe groups of traditionalists who have all run outside to live off the grid and off the land, but they ’ re a select few and kind of culty. That weird stuff always freaks me out. And you can always find someone in some alley somewhere who ’ s got an old bag of Skittles, but that ’ ll cost you an arm and a leg and you might end up getting shot for it. But I ’ m just a normal guy. I don ’ t wan na do some backalley deal or sell my soul to some random Jim Jones wannabe asshole in Backwater, Utah ( pop. 43 ). 
 
 And so I found myself on Darknet buying a six year-old can of SpaghettiOs for the equivalent of 150 bucks in cyptocurrency. Not a great deal, but not awful either. Plus they promise me prompt and discreet shipping. Worth every penny. 
 
 When the food arrived on my doorstep in a plain brown box with no identifying marks for my privacy, I was fuckin ’ floored. I scooped it up and took it into my kitchen. I drew closed the shades and made sure my blinds were shut. I opened up the can and dug in with my fingers, eating handful after handful of lukewarm SpaghettiOs. 
 
 It was glorious. The gritty blandness of chugging down bottle after bottle of Generic Human Dietary Fluid 2A-3E was a shadow of a nightmare in my mind. I crushed the noodles in my teeth and slurped up their tomato-y substrate. This is what we were meant to eat. This is real food. 
 
 But now I ’ m sitting in my car with my hands on the steering wheel—parked and waiting. There are picketers with angry signs moving up and down the block. Scary picketers. Violent, religious nutjobs. I want them to leave. The sign above the door of the building I ’ m parked outside of reads Planned Evacuation. My stomach churns and rumbles. It ’ s not used to solid food. 
 
 I wait for the line of picketers to move as far away from the door as possible before I undo my seatbelt and make my way out of the car. I bet if I told you five years ago that prune juice was going to be considered an abortifacient, you would have laughed your fucking head off. 

"," Write with the inspiring and determined tone of a revolutionary leader, calling for change.","My regimen is strict, a liquid diet, a testament to the times we live in. Soylent, a concoction of nutrients and electrolytes, fuels my system, a single potion divided across three bottles. This has been my sustenance since the monstrous creatures materialized, altering my life forever.

Though the liquid regimen may seem convenient, the inconveniences it has wrought have been profound. From single-ply toilet paper to baby wipes, the comforts I once enjoyed have been stripped away. Yet, the true agony lies in the monotony of my meals, a constant reminder of my diminished options.

The lack of variety is unbearable. I crave the tactile sensation of chewing, the enjoyment of textures and flavors. To satisfy this primal need, I have succumbed to temptation, indulging in solid food, a brief respite from this culinary wasteland.

I understand that my transgression may be met with disapproval, but I must assert that it is a natural desire, a battle against the forces of evolution. My teeth and gut have not evolved to process this synthetic liquid concoction, and I refuse to be a prisoner to its blandness.

Finding solid food is a challenge, but it is not insurmountable. There are communities of traditionalists who have chosen to live off the land, eschewing modern conveniences in favor of a more primitive existence. While their path is unconventional, it is one that I admire, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit."
"Dear Natasha `` Misty Fields'' Hendrickson, 
 
 My name is Tim Frances and I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I have seen all fifty six of your videos, from the beginning of your career until the one you released last week, `` All sluts covered in donkey cum volume 15: The Mule Chronicles.'' I have read your auto-biography published under Jism-Sluts Inc, labeled `` If I could n't suck dicks than I would probably sick clits instead.'' 
 
 I must admit, from your work, and your words, you have inspired me. I have never been more in awe of someone's prowess and intelligence than I am with you. When you say `` I'd rather get my asshole fucked open by three dicks than watch another Tyler Perry movie,'' I understand what you mean. When you called that reporter a `` cock-gurgling chode leech,'' and then kicked him in the side of the head with your high heel, I understand why. No one should be so invasive of your privacy as to ask you about your illegitimate children. That reporter deserved the hemorrhage he got. 
 
 Anyway, all that is neither here nor there. I wanted to write you to tell you that you have not only inspired me, but I am also enamored with you. All of your brilliance and awe inspiring quotes compare dismally to your utter beauty. The allure of your curves, the smell of your hair which I did n't steal from you at Pron Con Philadephia, the way your voice rings beautifully when you moan because you're getting a seventeen inch cock stuffed into your gaping train wreck of a vagina all make me want to be yours. 
 
 Yes, Natasha- I love you! I'm not ashamed to say it. I love you deeply. I've had feelings for you for so long, and looked on you from afar. But now, I write to you for the first time. True, it takes my whole heart and all the courage I can stomach, but I would be a slave to you- I would love you faithfully for all time. I would take it up the ass with your black ribbed dildo and allow you to water-torture me while you jack off with a rusty iron poker, as you stated was your ultimate sexual fantasy in your interview with Morry Ribs in `` Poke Her Magazine.'' Whatever I could do, please- tell me and I'll do it. I'm a loving man and I'm yours to do with what you please. 
 
 Yours truly, 
 
 - Tim.

"Mark Overly had to apply more force than was usually necessary to open his front door. The ongoing wintery mix outside had caused his home to settle awkwardly against the foundation, which resulted in the door not being able to open or close properly. For weeks now, any time he has needed to get back inside, Mark has had to throw his shoulder against the door in order to get the door open. The chillness of the air hitting his face caused him to curse out in exasperation. Whatever, he was finally outside. Carefully, he makes his way down from his slippery porch and Begins his trek across his snow covered lawn. Mark starts up his SUV and walks back towards his front door. Throwing his shoulder against the door he opens it, just missing his wife who was standing on the other side. `` Jesus Caroline! You okay?'' Mark exclaims, more worried about his wife safety than his own shoulder, which is now hurting him more than ever. `` Yes, I was just going to check and see how the roads are. I was having second thoughts about dinner tonight and if the roads were too bad I would have called and cancelled.'' `` It will be just fine sweetheart, I've driven on worse! Besides, I wo n't let anything ruin this night. We deserve this.'' He assures his wife. Truthfully though, he wanted nothing more than to just stay home that night. But he loves his wife and has n't treated her to anything in quite sometime. With the car warmed up Mark and Caroline start off to go eat. The restaurant is warm, as is the food. The pair spend most of their time there just regaling about their youths. Mark never tired of his wife's stories, and he hoped the same of her about his. Hours pass and the two of them decide that they should go back home. Whilst on the way home, Marks shoulder begins acting up, and as they approach a bridge a screaming pain shoots through it. The sudden pain causes him to recoil and the recoil causes him to turn the wheel. there was no time to stop or correct the vehicle, Mark grabs his wife's hand and closes his eyes. Nothing. Nothing happened. Mark opens his eyes and everything is still. Snowflakes hung in the air, tears frozen on his wife's face along side her feared expression. He did n't quite understand what was happening. Outside his window he sees movement. `` Hello!'' The something spoke. Mark realised it was a man. He evacuates the SUV. It was stopped just before the guardrail on the bridge. Mark finally gained the strength to ask the man something. `` Excuse and pardon me, but what the hell is happening here?'' The other man just stops moving and smiles. `` Well, it just so happens that I saved your life... well sort of. You see, I am not allowed to interfere with the lives of mortals. Well, I was passing by and saw that you were in a spot of trouble. So I stopped time for you. Right now you are not quite alive... but you also are n't dead. The only way to make time return is to get back in that vehicle there and close your eyes. So, in essence, I have n't saved you just... what am I looking for here... oh right, I merely postponed the inevitable. Of course you can always just not start time again.'' Mark stared at the man incredulously. `` So I'm doomed to die then?'' Mark looks back at his vehicle and his wife. He turns to say something to the man bit he was gone. Mark stood there for quite a while. Thinking of scenarios that could save his wife and himself. Nothing, nothing could be done. He decided he had to just get back in the car, he had to at least be with his wife. Thoughts of their past flooded his mind. Meeting her, falling in love with her, the first time they made love, their wedding day, and finally their date tonight. He weighed his options, wander the earth and see everything he always wanted to, go places he always dreamed of... No! He did n't want yo do any of that without his wife. He opens the car door, gets in his seat. Looks at his wife, and grabs her hand. He takes a deep breath in and closes his eyes, then he breathes out.

"`` Shit, Shit, Shit.'' It had become a mantra, a chant that had been the soundtrack to my being forced to leave Heaven became official. A guard, armor shining like the sun rushed around the corner. I swore and drew my sword. I caught him in the neck with it before he could draw his weapon and he fell. hard. 
 
 It pained me to kill my brothers but they left me no choice. I needed to figure out a way out before the Archangels started showing up. Heaven is a little rough for a lot of mortals to comprehend. For most of them it shows up as an idyllic suburb, or a golden castle. The area behind the curtain is a bit more like a maze, or a military barracks. I was in the human inhabited section of heaven, sprinting down a hallway lined with doors. I recognized it as the VIP area somewhere in the back of my head. 
 
 Why are you fighting your way out Ezriel? If they're already evicting you, why ca n't you just leave? I can hear the questions already. 
 
 Well being cast down means something different than it meant in olden times. You lose your angel powers, forced to live among the humans to'humble' you. After what I found..I ca n't afford to be that vulnerable. They'd kill me in a second. 
 
 `` This way! Move!'' A figure down the hallway. Dressed like a human. I sprinted towards him at full tilt. He's in a black military style jacket, hoodie underneath pulled up to hide his face. It's a stark contrast to the white and gold of most things in Heaven. He's holding open a door. 
 
 `` Who the hell are you?'' I asked. 
 
 `` A friend.'' He shot back. He pulled a jar from inside his jacket and shook it. He rolled it up the hallway. A dozen more angels emerged from a door at the far end of the hallway. They abruptly skidded to a halt upon noticing the jar, which had begun shaking and emitting a painfully bright light. 
 
 `` We're gon na wan na leave.'' My new accomplice barked. He half shoved, half threw me through the door. I tumbled out of Heaven and into Earth rather unceremoniously. A massive explosion chased us out the door. He jumped up and slammed the door shut. 
 
 He pounded on the door triumphantly. 
 
 `` Try getting through that before next week you uptight bastards!'' He crowed. I noticed the wings at this point and climbed to my feet shakily. 
 
 `` You're an angel?'' I asked. 
 
 `` There is a lot you do n't know, Brother.'' He said. 
 
 `` That means everything I heard about the civil war was...'' 
 
 `` Later.'' He hissed. `` The Earth garrison will be on our trails very soon. We did n't exactly land quietly.'' He gestured at me to follow him and began walking. 
 
 `` Do you have a name?'' 
 
 `` Azazel.'' He said simply. He tossed me a balled up pile of human clothing. `` Your armor is going to stick out like a sore thumb.'' 
 
 I looked down at the golden armor I was wearing. It was my last connection to who I was. Ezriel, loyal warrior of the Host. I stared at the clothes in my hand for a long second while Azazel paced nervously. I stripped out of my armor and donned the human clothes I had been given. It just felt... wrong. 
 
 `` There we go. Less angelic warrior, more Steve from the apartment next door.'' He grinned. He passed me what look like a butterfly knife. He nodded at me to open it. I flipped it open and saw the markings. 
 
 `` this looks like it was forged in-'' 
 
 `` Not quite.'' He cut off my question. `` We have a weapons guy down here too. That's less conspicuous than the sword.'' 
 
 I nod and pass him my sword. I'm past the point of no return at this point. He makes a quick gesture with his fingers and the blade disappears. We walk down the street, blending in with the humans. 
 
 `` I'm assuming you have questions.'' Azazel said. `` They always do.'' 
 
 `` Why would n't they tell us about the civil war?'' I asked incredulously. `` I'm a member of the Host. I should have been told.'' 
 
 `` Discussing the current fighting, tends to lead to discussions about the fighting's cause. The higher ups do n't really like that getting out. Tends to put them in a bad light.'' He chuckled. Two men in white suits step out of a post office directly behind us, eyes fixed on us. 
 
 `` They do not do subtle well do they?'' Azazel sounded amused rather than worried at this point. 
 
 `` The Earth garrison?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Two of em behind us.'' He replied. `` Anyway-'' He continued conversationally. `` They've been sending Archangels to do their dirty work. Only the most hardline zealots get to fight in Heavens war.'' 
 
 `` That does n't make sense.'' I replied, eyeing the pair behind us. 
 
 `` Here.'' Azazel grabbed my shoulder and led me into an alley. The two angels followed us, oblivious to a pair of dark shapes that dropped down behind them. I heard a surprised gasp and two bodies hitting the ground. Standing over them are two more figures dressed in dark human clothes. They both closed butterfly knives with a showy twirl and proceeded to drag the bodies out of view of the street. 
 
 `` Belial, Phenex.'' He greeted the two fallen angels. 
 
 `` The boss wants a word with this one.'' Belial grunted in a deep baritone voice. 
 
 The boss? They could n't mean... fuck, they did did n't they? Azazel noticed me tensing up and placed a calming hand on my shoulder. 
 
 `` Relax Ezriel. He just wants to make sure you're on the up and up.'' He said. We walked to a door marked with a tiny pentagram. Azazel placed his hand on it and the door creaked open slowly, a staircase disappearing into the darkness inside. 
 
 Time and space do n't mean a lot to angels. Lucifer's office could have been anywhere in the world. It looked like a penthouse office looking down over the New York skyline, but that did n't mean much. A guard in a dark suit nodded curtly at me before letting me in. 
 
 Lucifer, the Devil, The Light Bringer, The Prince Of Lies and a million other names was sipping a brandy with his back to me. 
 
 `` I need to redo this office. I think it tends to give people the wrong idea about me.'' Lucifer's voice was n't a booming roar. It was n't a snakelike hiss. It was the commanding voice of a being more than used to making tough decisions on a daily basis. 
 
 `` You're...'' I did n't have words. Lucifer swiveled in his chair to face me. He had dark black hair, blue eyes and a scar that wound its way down his face from his left temple to his jaw on his right side. 
 
 `` Take a seat Ezriel. We need to talk.'' He said calmly. 
 
 `` You were right.'' Was the first thing I said. `` This whole time you were right.'' 
 
 `` A father would n't cast out his son like that.'' He agreed. 
 
 `` But I just could n't believe that God is..'' 
 
 `` We do n't believe he's dead. Missing or captured, absolutely. But our father is n't dead.'' He said firmly. `` Zachariah, my counter part up there, would love to get someone inside my operation. Convince me why I should trust you.'' He leaned forward, staring at me intently. I noticed that the desk between us had disappeared, and that Lucifer was now toying with a very large knife as opposed to a glass of brandy. 
 
 `` I killed five of my brothers to get to your people. I'm marked for death by every single on of my former comrades.'' I said angrily. 
 
 `` Every single of Zach's spies have said that. Every. Single. One.'' He articulated that point by gesturing with the knife. 
 
 `` What do you really want?'' Lucifer asked. `` Why are you here Ezriel?'' 
 
 `` I..I want freedom. To think how I want. To admire fathers work as something more than a museum piece. To live how I want.'' I said, surprised at my own answer. 
 
 `` I cast something that compels to give the most honest answer you can. It tends to weed out the spies. Benign enough to be ignored by most counter spell work but immensely powerful.'' He said smiling. The knife was gone now. 
 
 `` Welcome to the Fallen.'' He said shaking my hand.

But for me, it was more like a maze, a labyrinth of illusions. I was trapped in the human-inhabited section of Heaven, sprinting down a hallway lined with doors, each one holding the promise of oblivion.

The voices echoed in my head, ""Why are you fighting your way out, Ezriel? If they're already evicting you, why can't you just leave?"" I knew they were right. But I couldn't just give up. After what I had found, I couldn't afford to be that vulnerable. I was a man cast down from Heaven, forced to live among the humans, humbled and alone.

A figure stood at the end of the hallway, his back to me. He was dressed in a black military-style jacket, his hood pulled up to hide his face. He was holding open a door, his eyes shining with determination. I sprinted towards him, my sword drawn, and he threw me through the door. I tumbled out of Heaven and into Earth, the ground rushing to meet me.

The world below was a mess, but I didn't care. I was free. I was no longer trapped in the gilded cage of Heaven. I was a man, standing alone, facing the challenges of the world."
"The courthouse had swollen with damp since its last trial twenty years ago. Spears of light fell through a ragged hole in the roof. Ivy cascaded down hanging low in the room, and a small garden of flowers had grown among the benches underneath. The quarter-sawn white oak panels surrounding the room had warped and black fungus sprung out in wet pockets. 
 
 Only those required for guard duty, and children whose mothers felt they were too young to see and hear such things, had stayed behind. 
 
 From James' perspective it looked like a church, pews brimming with the people whose lives he had saved countless times, and they his. They had come to worship the only thing that mattered anymore, the sanctity of human life. 
 
 `` The council has come to a decision.'' said Rafe, a broad man with closely cropped hair sitting in place of a judge, his well used North Face jacket looking like robes. How fitting James thought. 
 
 `` James, we have found you guilty of murder.'' 
 
 A wave of movement and murmuring swept through the crowd. 
 
 `` Before this tragedy struck this was a most heinous crime. But now, when there is so few of us left, even with the cure...'' Rafe trailed off, looking at the faces of the people he had been asked to lead. `` Your late wife, Amy, was a wonderful woman. A friend to my own family. She did not deserve what you did to her, no one could.'' said Rafe, choking a blub in his throat as the words left his lips. 
 
 James stared into space with sunken red-rimmed eyes, his skin grey and lifeless, and his clothes caked in arterial blood. He had n't said a word through the entire day's proceedings. 
 
 `` We can only take your silence as an admission of guilt, and sentence you to death by hanging.'' said Rafe with a heavy heart, turning to his fellow council members for support, `` Please take him away. The hanging will take place at sundown.'' 
 
 As James was hauled back to their makeshift jail between the courthouse pews, John Galwin, an older man in a red checked flannel shirt and mountain cap stood up. 
 
 `` Bastard!'' he screamed. His wife looked at him sombrely and pulled him back to his seat by his arm, before curling herself around it for comfort. 

"," Write with Orwell's clarity and foresight, focusing on political themes and the use of language.","The courthouse, once vibrant with life, now stood as a testament to the relentless march of time. The dampness that permeated the air was as tangible as the ghosts of memories that lingered in the room. Ivy, once cascading gracefully, now hung limp, mirroring the decline of the once vibrant community. The withered benches, adorned with flowers, stood as stark reminders of life lost and the fragility of existence.

Only a few individuals remained within the confines of the courtroom, their presence dictated by necessity or the need for solace. James, the accused, stared blankly at the wall, his eyes mirroring the emptiness of the room. The burden of his actions weighed heavily on his countenance, a testament to the devastating consequences of human cruelty.

The words of Rafe, the judge, echoed through the courtroom, each one dripping with sorrow and regret. He spoke of the loss of a beloved wife, a friend to his family, and pleaded for justice. However, his words fell upon deaf ears, as James remained silent, his silence serving as an admission of guilt.

As James was led away, the courtroom erupted in a wave of despair and anger. The hanging, a cruel and final punishment, was a stark reminder of the fleeting nature of life and the enduring power of justice. It was a moment of solemn reflection, a testament to the interconnectedness of human destiny, and a testament to the enduring power of compassion and understanding."
"Finding good help around here is nearly impossible. 
 
 Do you think the kind of people willing to sacrifice babies and children to a supposedly bloodthirsty entity make good babysitters? Spoiler alert: they don ’ t. They really, really don ’ t. 
 
 So that leaves me, Satan, with—what is it now, like 250,000? —babies to take care of. 
 
 Throughout the millennia I have changed thousands upon thousands of diapers, prepared millions of bottles, and sung countless lullabies. And in case this wasn ’ t clear enough, let me reiterate: I do it all on my own. Now, I ’ m not looking for praise here—although let ’ s be honest, I deserve it—I just want to set the record straight on the whole sacrificing babies thing. 
 
 I'm actually a really nice guy, a nice guy who, as it so happens, never asked anyone to kill any babies. This baby sacrifice issue has been a serious blight on my reputation since the beginning. 
 
 All people ever talk about is the baby sacrifice! 
 
 Here I am, acting as a surrogate parent to a ton of kids that aren ’ t mine, kids that I never even asked for, while everyone upstairs gossips about what a bad, baby killing guy I am. As if I don ’ t already have enough on my plate! 
 
 Oh, and trust me, whenever I find out which one of these degenerates started the rumor that I crave “ the blood of the innocent ” and “ bathe in the blood of the unborn, ” he or she is headed straight to Malebolge. Honestly, as if everyone down here doesn ’ t already know that I bathe in mineral water. “ Blood of the unborn, ” yeah right. Not with these sensitive pores. 
 
 Well here I go, officially setting the record straight: remove baby sacrifice from the satanic agenda. I do not want it, I never wanted it, please stop. 
 
 I ’ m at my wits end. I work day in and day out looking after all these infants, and for what? A reputation for being a big ol ’ jerk? 
 
 For evil ’ s sake, I ’ m doing the best I can. If I ever come across as mean, cut me some slack. As a single father of 250,000, I think I'm entitled to being a little cranky once in a while. 

", Convey emotions and actions with the exaggerated expressiveness of a silent movie star.,"(In the style of a silent movie star)

As the devil, I have a heavy burden on my hands, the weight of the world, and the responsibility of a father to 250,000 babies. Oh, the challenges I face daily...

Look at me, struggling with the diaper duty, preparing bottles in the wee hours, and singing lullabies like a broken wind chime. All on my own, I am the master of my domain.

I'm not a monster, people. I'm actually a good guy, a good guy who never asked anyone to sacrifice babies. But the rumors persist, like a plague of misinformation. They call me a bloodthirsty tyrant, a devil who bathes in the blood of the innocent. It's simply not true.

I have a lot on my plate already, between dealing with all these babies and dealing with the gossip upstairs. But I'm not going to let those rumors get me down. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing, one diaper at a time.

So, let me set the record straight once and for all: remove baby sacrifice from the satanic agenda. I do not want it, I never wanted it, please stop. I'm at my wits end. I'm doing the best I can. If I ever come across as mean, cut me some slack. As a single father, I'm all I've got."
"`` Those penguin bastards are on to us,'' said the 2 star general, attentively looking at a wide screen monitor in a secret submarine off the coast of Antarctica, standing still in the sea of crewmen quickly running to their battle stations. 
 `` What's the status report on the situation, Sargeant Mills?'' The general turned to his right to find Sargent Mills sitting down at a computer, quickly finding information in no time at all. 
 `` They have received numerous AK-74s as well as the Tsar Bomba, general.'' he quickly stated. 
 `` So the rumors are true,'' The general gasped in disbelief. He never believed a word from Iran's government until now. 
 `` We must prepare a landing party. Harvey, prepare a bomb defuse squad now!'' The general barked with a hint of fury.

"," Rewrite the essay as if it were an ancient Egyptian chronicle, detailing events in honor of pharaohs and gods, using appropriate terminology and references.","""In the year of the Great Cat, the falcon soared through the heavens, carrying tales of the mighty Pharaohs and the divine powers of the gods. The land trembled beneath the weight of their majestic presence, and the rivers flowed with their blood.

In this chronicle, we recount the events that unfolded in honor of these illustrious beings. As the sun cast long shadows upon the sand, Pharaohs adorned their temples with glistening jewels and carved their names upon colossal statues. Their armies marched through the land, spreading terror and prosperity in their wake.

The gods, immortal beings of immense power, danced through the heavens, guiding the Pharaohs and protecting their realm. The sun shone brighter than any gold, and the moon cast long shadows upon the earth, illuminating the night sky.

In one such tale, a formidable Pharaoh named Ramses II, known for his colossal temples and unmatched strength, faced a threat from the land of Iran. A treacherous force, known as the Persians, had amassed a formidable arsenal, including numerous AK-74s and the Tsar Bomba. The news reached Pharaoh's ears, and he knew that he must take action.

With swiftness, Ramses II assembled an army and ordered the construction of a massive landing force. He entrusted the task of defusing the Persian weapons to a squad of skilled bomb defusers, led by the renowned warrior, Harvey. As the sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the land, the landing party set sail, their hearts filled with determination.

In the aftermath of the battle, Pharaoh Ramses II stood tall, his power unchallenged. The land trembled beneath his feet, and the people marveled at his strength and glory. And so, the tale of Pharaoh Ramses II, a testament to the enduring power and wisdom of the ancient Egyptians, is forever etched in the annals of history."
"Is n't it ironic that man had always looked *upward* in his search for peers? 
 
 At the turn of the twenty second century, man's enthusiasm towards the search for extraterrestrial life had waned. SETI had operated for close to a century without any success. Hundreds, if not thousands of planets had been surveyed and found wanting for anything resembling life, never mind intelligence. Humanity had taken its first tentative steps towards becoming a spacefaring race, guided by a new Manifest Destiny - that the stars were his for the taking. 
 
 Somehow, nobody thought that they should relinquish their own in doing so. 
 
 First contact with *Octopus Sapiens* was in 2126. Even at that point, the oceans had remained woefully undermapped despite vast advances in technology. There was simply no need - why bother? Space offered so much more promise. The oceans were simply reserves - of minerals, biological diversity, heat capacity. It was n't until the first interstellar colonies were established that humanity belatedly realised that it had never bothered to fully explore its homeworld. Even then, it did so with no real passion - it was more for the sake of knowing than anything else - by then, humanity was self-sufficient enough that anything new would probably be of marginal benefit. 
 
 Humanity had known of deep sea communities since the early days of oceanic exploration. Near the limits where the sun's light could penetrate, life nonetheless thrived around hydrothermal vents which belched nutrients and heat continuously. However, these pockets of diversity were simply considered oases in the vast desert that the sea floor was assumed to be. Nobody considered the possibility that there could be entire ridges of such vents that supported vast ecosystems, just as rivers were the lifeblood of communities on land. 
 
 The operators of the *Pequod* must have been astonished when they happened upon what would be known as the Edenic vent system. An entire city of Neolithic octopodes, comfortably settled into a pastoral farming system. Well developed communication skills, established tool use and established knowledge of advanced concepts swiftly proved beyond all reasonable doubt that they were no intellectual inferiors to humans. All that impeded their development was the discovery of certain key technologies. 
 
 Recognising that he had finally found an equal, man's entire outlook changed. No longer was he alone!

Nonetheless, it probably would not have been discovered if the baby had never bothered to leave in the first place.

"during college I studied psychology, was never particularly good at it but it was always interesting and the lecturers were pretty cool. 
 
 Well anyway we got on to memory and the schema; sweet we get to do an experiment where we hook someone up to an actual polygraph and try to fool their memory with a loaded interview. Now 17 year old me is super excited by all of this so when the lecturer asks for a volunteer I'm absolutely the first hand in the air. 
 
 So I go ahead and wander down the front and get strapped in and sticky padded up... nope, no connection, no pulse, no activity, nothing. Obviously the machine is broken most of the college kit is old and pretty janky anyway. So we fall back on the analogue blood pressure meter and someone taking my pulse with their hand. 
 
 Well long story short they could n't get anything either and when they plug the next person into the polygraph it bursts into life.

As the lecturer's voice reverberated through the hall, I couldn't contain my excitement when he requested a volunteer. With lightning speed, I shot my hand up, my enthusiasm rivaling that of a turbo-charged neural implant. I was strapped in, sticky pads adorning my skin, but alas, there was no connection, no pulse, no activity. The machine was broken, a testament to the antiquated nature of the college equipment. We reverted to the archaic blood pressure meter and a manual pulse reading.

The experiment yielded nothing, and as I watched the next person be hooked up, the polygraph burst into life. It was a surreal moment, one that illustrated the capricious nature of fate and the fleeting nature of memory.

"I sniffed. The scent of rosemary and thyme hung heavy in the air. It had been a long time since I had been summoned away from the Other Place. I wondered what year it was. I wondered where I was. I would n't get any of those answers from the flickering candle that sat on the floor, so I turned around to face the blithering sot that had summoned me this time. 
 
 `` Bartimaeus,'' he said, eyes flickering back between me and the book he held in his hand. His knees were shivering. What kind of world was this, a world where seventeen-year olds had access to ancient spellbooks? Not that I should be questioning this. Apparently, Nathaniel had not been an exception. 
 
 I turned into a hideous, five headed-dragon. Perhaps I could scare him out of the pentacle where he stood. 
 
 No such luck. He barely batted an eye. Perhaps a shambling zombie? I shifted between several gruesome forms of undead before giving up. 
 
 Teenagers these days. Desensitized to everything, I suppose. 
 
 `` Alright, alright. What do you want from me?'' I grumbled. Maybe it would be just a quick errand. Oh, who was I kidding. He would probably keep me around as his slave for five years, maybe more - until the day I could outwit him. 
 
 `` Bartimaeus of Uruk,'' he began again. `` I command you to write a six page single-spaced essay on the cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan.'' 
 
 I became an ethereal puff of dark and foreboding gloom. I did n't know what China was, or what a cross-strait relationship was, but I knew exactly what this *child* was asking of me. 
 
 `` Do you know who I am?'' I thundered. `` I am Bartimaeus of Uruk. I have conversed with the afrits of Egypt and held counsel with Ptolmey. I have spoken with Solomon the Great. And you are *asking* me to do your homework?'' 
 
 `` Do it, or I will use the Stimulating Compass.'' 
 
 I sighed. Bollocks. Looks like it was time to do some research.
", Transform the text to reflect the elegance and societal observations characteristic of a Jane Austen novel.,"The scent of rosemary and thyme, a symphony of olfactory delight, permeated the air, an aroma that bespoke the elegance of the Regency era. The flickering candle cast long shadows upon the floor, illuminating the countenance of the youthful Bartimaeus, whose eyes danced between the text of the ancient spellbook and the presence of the esteemed guest. A sense of anticipation lingered in the air, as I wondered what secrets the evening held for me.

The aroma of the rosemary and thyme danced with the scent of anticipation in the air. My senses were heightened, and my mind raced with thoughts of the myriad possibilities that lay before me. I turned to face Bartimaeus, his knees trembling beneath him. His eyes flickered between the book and me, a testament to his youthful naivety.

I contemplated the grotesque five-headed dragon that stood menacingly in the pentacle. Perhaps I could scare him out of his perch, but my temper was as volatile as a hurricane, and I knew that such a display would only exacerbate the situation. Instead, I opted for a more subtle approach, one that would leave my mark upon his soul without resorting to violence.

With an air of authority, I spoke. ""Bartimaeus of Uruk,"" I declared, my voice echoing through the hall. ""I command you to write a six-page single-spaced essay on the cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan.""

The young man's eyes widened in terror. He knew that I was not a woman of idle threats, and he began to plead for mercy. But I was not in a mood for mercy. I took a deep breath, and with the force of a storm, I delivered my command.

As I watched him scurry away, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. He had been humbled, and I had won. The scent of rosemary and thyme lingered in the air, a reminder of the elegant evening that had just passed."
"Many ancient scholars speculated that *if* the universe is a computer program, life should never, under any circumstances, know this fact, for *if* it ever figured it out, modern civilization would instantly crumble. Of course, those scholars never went a step ahead to see the ultimate truth; That *if* the universe is a computer program, the only reasonable explanation for its existence would be that it is a videogame. This is why, when Alexander Wilfery conquered the world as the first emperor of a unified humanity, the first thing he did was turn off the PvP. No more murder, no more wars, and no more boxing matches, because honestly, those *'matches'* were only rigged events organized for the singular purpose of betting. 
 
 Alexander Wilfery was a polarizing figure on Earth... to say the least. Some would argue that he was a tyrant, imposing his will unto humanity without the right to do so. Others would argue that being the only human with access to the source code technically granted him the right to do as he pleased. A third, small, but vocal group of people would say: 
 
 `` Yes, okay, he can do whatever he wants, but why'd he have to take our boxing?'' 
 
 His actions definitely influenced history for centuries to come, shifting the economy from one of service labor to a flourishing utopia of science and arts. One profession in particular, assassination, thrived in this new world due to its rare and difficult nature. Turning off the PvP did n't make humans immortal, only harder to kill. Now, instead of letting the thrilling anticipation of murder overtake them, assassins had to be trained from birth to repress their intent. Fortunately for the old families that already practiced the art of killing, this came extremely easy, since they already implemented this in their training. Unfortunately for Alexander Wilfery, the nurse administering his flu-shot was one of said assassins. 
 
 Sitting atop the doctor's table, Alexander slouched and pouted. He was n't afraid of shots, he just was n't a fan of them. His hands were n't shaking out of nervousness, they were just shaking out of exasperation... or boredom. When the nurse flicked the needle with her finger, he did n't gulp because the purple liquid seemed menacing, he gulped because his throat was dry. 
 
 `` Lord Emperor...'' said the nurse, `` you seem on edge right now. Is something bothering you?'' 
 
 `` N-no, I'm just stressed from all the things I have to do this afternoon.'' He extended his arm. `` Please, lets get on with this.'' 
 
 `` As you wish, my lord.'' 
 
 The nurse grabbed Alexander's wrist and placed the needle on his skin, right before Alexander squealed and pulled his arm away. The woman's eyes widened with fear, backing away from the Emperor a few steps. She then said: 
 
 `` Did I do something wrong?!? How did you kno-'' 
 
 `` No, no!'' Alexander waved his hands in denial. `` Forgive me, nurse, it was instinct. You did n't say you were inserting the needle, so it startled me.'' 
 
 The nurse fixed her shirt and said: 
 
 `` Okay, Lord Emperor. This time, I'll warn you right before I do it.'' 
 
 Alexander nodded and the nurse grabbed his arm again. She then moved the needle slowly towards his vein, warning him once it was near, only to have Alexander push her away. The nurse's mouth gaped open, staring at the needle in her hand and back at a sheepish Alexander Wilfery. 
 
 `` Listen,'' said Alexander, `` you're gon na have to stab me with it, okay?'' 
 
 `` Oka- wait, what?'' 
 
 `` You'll have to force the shot unto me. My rational mind knows it ca n't harm me, but my body just wo n't let it enter. I'm sorry, I know this is strange, but can you oblige this strange request?'' 
 
 The nurse grinned and dashed at Alexander, who dodged her by rolling away. She then leaped at him, doing a stabbing motion with the syringe five times, though Alexander evaded all of them fluidly. The nurse, breathing heavily, finally wrestled Alexander to the ground and, laughing maniacally, manged to connect with the needle. Afterwards, her laughter faded into a worried sigh. The needle was bent. It did n't pierce Alexander's skin. The Emperor quickly called for his guards, who flooded the room before the assassin could get away. Restraining her from behind, they inspected her and found a golden necklace of two fighting gloves. 
 
 `` The Boxing Federation...'' said Alexander. `` So they finally made their move, huh?'' 
 
 From this point on, assassination attempts on Alexander's life would become a rare occurrence. Everyone thought he was an omnipotent being, capable of sensing even the slightest of intents. His rule would go on for centuries, and his empire would last for thousands of years more. Of course, no one would dare to think that all of this fame only came to him because of his crippling fear of needles.

"," Style the text after a Victorian detective story, including intricate plots, deductive reasoning, and a foggy London setting.","The fog shrouded London like a blanket on a cold night, obscuring even the most seasoned detective. The streets teemed with the stench of coal smoke and damp earth, a symphony of smells that permeated the air. It was a night ripe for mystery, a night where a man named Alexander Wilfery found himself embroiled in a plot that would shake the very foundations of civilization.

Wilfery was a man of contradictions. He was a champion of peace, yet a master of war. He was a visionary leader, yet a tyrant. He was a man of immense wealth and power, yet a man of humble beginnings. And he was a man who, through a single act, would change the course of history.

The story begins with a series of murders that sent shockwaves through the city. Victims were found dead in their beds, their bodies bearing the marks of a sharp blade. The only connection between the victims was their association with Alexander Wilfery.

As the fog shrouded the streets, Wilfery found himself entangled in a web of intrigue. He found himself caught between two warring factions, each vying for control of the world. The only way to escape the clutches of this mystery was to use his deductive reasoning, his wit, and his determination.

Through a series of intricate steps, Wilfery pieced together the puzzle. He discovered that the murders were not merely acts of violence, but rather they were carefully orchestrated events designed to destabilize the world. He found that the perpetrators were not mere criminals, but pawns in a much grander game.

In the end, Wilfery's deductions led him to the mastermind behind the murders. It was a man named John Smith, a man driven by a desire for power and control. Smith's reign of terror ended when Wilfery exposed his plot and brought him to justice.

The case of Alexander Wilfery is a testament to the power of deductive reasoning and the importance of understanding the world around us. It is a story about the transformative power of a single act and the lasting impact it can have on the world."
"Brigadier Clairvoyant stalked through The Magnificent's lair. The Magnificent had been rampaging throughout the city for weeks now, killing, stealing, and wreaking havoc. He was the worst villain the city had seen in decades. His craftiness made his attacks incredibly effective, and worse still, there were rumors that he was using the proceeds of these attacks to complete a brainwashing ray. The Magnificent had defeated Lord Puncher, had defeated The Industrial Captain, but Clairvoyant was different. Where Magnificent had trapped other supers, those supers who relied on their powers, Clairvoyant was different. Clairvoyant had to rely on his brain, had to find every advantage he could get to make up for his lack of physical ability. 
 
 This made it difficult for him to fight a normal villain. But Magnificent was worse than a normal villain, was craftier, knew how to beat a super. This was why Brigadier Clairvoyant kept his exploits low-key, and waited for situations like these. Because the best way to deal with a villain like nobody's ever seen is to give them a hero like they've never seen. 
 
 Brigadier Clairvoyant maintained his psychic aura, ready to detect the minds of any nearby guards. He could n't be too careful. If he was detected, his means of fighting back or escaping were limited. So he merely had to stay undetected. 
 
 A guard! No, two. No, a lot of guards, in fact. All around one room. Brigadier Clairvoyant read closer. 
 
 *Why are we guarding the latrine? I get that supers'll think its important, but they wo n't fall for it for long, and it'll get me killed. I should have taken that job at Wal-* 
 
 Brigadier Clairvoyant moved on through the dimly-lit, sparsely decorated concrete lair. It made sense that it would be, as Magnificent would waste no money on trivialities. Any funds would go towards his dastardly plans. 
 
 That was when he saw the doors. Massive, double, oaken doors. Exquisitely hand-crafted, gilded with gold, ornate doorknobs. Guarded by two guards who appeared to be veterans of multiple wars, skilled enough to pose a challenge to any super. Brigadier Clairvoyant grinned. Now here was a challenge. Neither guard knew what was inside the room, either, which showed just how important it was. 
 
 Brigadier Clairvoyant began to think on just how to pass this challenge. 
 
 Ten minutes and several feet of shoelace later, he was in. 
 
 And he was shocked. The entire room was filled with exquisitely bound books. In the center of the room was an armchair as magnificent as its owner, facing a fireplace. But nobody was sitting in the chair, and nobody was in the room. Just books. Brigadier Clairvoyant moved towards the shelves, running a hand over the spines of the books, wondering what would bring Magnificent to spend so much on books, of all things. 
 
 Then he noticed the titles. Or rather, the title. One title, and a worrying one at that. *How to make sure no one is reading your mind*. Every book had that title. He took one last check for other people and picked a book off the shelves. 
 
 Why were the pages blank? Why would he-wait. There was something on that last page, what was it? 
 
 *Distract him. *

The sun shone through the gleaming chrome of the perfect kitchen appliances, casting long, happy shadows upon the gleaming floor. The housewife, a paragon of domesticity and optimism, surveyed her domain. Her family, bathed in the afternoon sun, filled the dining table with laughter. The future was bright, the world was peaceful, and the housewife, the keeper of this domestic paradise, felt complete.

This idyllic scene, however, was shattered by a sinister force. The villainous Magnificent had been wreaking havoc, and his latest target was the city's innocent civilians. But Brigadier Clairvoyant, a psychic powerhouse whose strength lay in his mind rather than brute force, stood guard against this menace.

Clairvoyant, known for his meticulous planning and unwavering resolve, knew that a villain like The Magnificent would be crafty. He meticulously mapped out the villain's lair, anticipating every move. He relied on his heightened senses to detect the minds of any nearby guards, ensuring his safety and the protection of others.

In this battle of wits, Clairvoyant had to outsmart and outgun the Magnificent. He knew that a simple battle of strength would be futile against a villain who could manipulate minds and craft deadly weapons. Instead, he waited for an opportunity to exploit the villain's vulnerabilities.

As he moved through the dimly lit concrete lair, Clairvoyant encountered a guard. With swift precision, he read the guard's mind, assessing his strengths and weaknesses. He knew that the guard's mind was sharp, but his physical abilities were limited. Utilizing his psychic powers, Clairvoyant manipulated the guard's thoughts, causing him to doubt his own presence and flee.

With the guard's presence eliminated, Clairvoyant continued his journey through the lair, finally reaching the massive, gilded doors that led to The Magnificent's inner sanctum. With a determined glint in his eye, he prepared to face the villain and bring peace back to the city."
"When I opened the auditorium room doors, almost all the seats had been taken. I was on the last bus to arrive; it must have been running late because the presentation had already begun. An usher guided us to our seats in the back row. I sat down and took a moment to look around at everyone there. Some were clean, wearing suits, and had a professional appeal. Others were wearing jumpsuits, overalls, and other blue collar attire stained with motor oil or dirt. There had to be hundreds of us shoved into this room. 
 The woman to my left had a doctors coat with a name tag that said `` Maria Gonzales, Pediatrician''. The man to my right was a middle aged man with glasses wearing a sweater vest and khakis. His name tag said `` Jaque De Ville, Archaeologist''. I leaned over and said, `` Excuse me sir, but do you happen to know what this is all about?'' He gave me a puzzled look and said something in what I think was french. At this point I figured it was best to pay attention to what was happening down front. 
 `` Again I want to apologize to you all. I know strange men showing up at your homes in black suits demanding you come with them is....unnerving, but you have my sincerest gratitude for doing so. This maybe the most important moment of your lives.'' 
 `` Cut the formalities,'' a man yelled near the front, `` you take us from our homes, our families without giving us any slightest reason why! We want answers!'' 
 The rest of the room stirred at the mans comment. Some started shouting more questions while others sat still knowing their inquiries will be answered. The man raised his hands and the room grew quiet. 
 `` If you would please calm yourselves, I promise to answer all questions you may have.'' the presenter said. 
 The room stayed quiet, the man continued. 
 `` I am excited to share with you that everyone in this room has been hand selected to be a part of the greatest achievement of mankind. Our goal here is to build the world's first utopia; a whole city devoted to one goal, to advance humanity to its pinnacle of existence. Our city will find cures to diseases, invent unlimited power sources, and push the human body to its limits. We our the greatest minds on Earth, so lets put them together! Each one of you is the foremost expert in your respective field. Neurosurgeon to fishermen, all professions are present. After this presentation you will be divided into groups where all your professions will compliment each other. If you would look at the book that you were given at the start, you will find what group you belong to.'' 
 Everyone pulled out a small red book from their person, except for me. I was not given anything. I looked over to the woman on my left to get a glimpse at the book. It had list after list of names and that persons role here. The women looked up at me questioningly. 
 `` Excuse me miss but do you speak English?'' I asked. 
 She smiled and said, `` I know enough, can I help you?'' She had a very thick Spanish accent. 
 `` I'm afraid I was not given a book. Could you look up my name so I know what group I belong to?'' 
 I had n't the slightest idea why I was here. I've bounced from restaurant to restaurant working as a cook, but I know I'm definitely not the best chef on Earth. I was puzzled as to why I was picked to come. I gave the women my name and she started to look through the book. She went through every page until she reached the end of the book. I watched her eyes move down to the bottom of the page and then grow wide as if she had just seen a ghost. She turned her gaze to me, still wide eyed. I have never seen such fear in a persons eyes. She quickly gathered her things and left the room running. This did not help put me at ease. 
 The presentation had finished and every one was up and about forming their groups. I would be greeted with smiles until they read my name tag and then it was the same look of fear the women had given me. I started to become agitated and made a B-line for the Presenter. It was easy as everyone around me tried to avoid me. I reached the man up front but before I could say anything, he looked at me and said, `` Mr. Carmikel, please follow me.'' and before I could reply he was walking toward the door. 
 The Presenter led me to a small room with nothing but a desk and two chairs. The man sat down and gestured for me to do the same. He smiled and said, `` Now Samuel, may I call you Sam, Sam you have a very important role to play here.'' 
 `` I'm sorry sir but I'm afraid I was not given a book so I have-'' 
 `` Sam I know you were not given a book, that was my idea. I wanted to tell you your role here in person because I truly believe you may have the most important job here.'' 
 Now I was very confused, `` Sir I'm just a cook, an average cook. I feel there must have been some sort of mistake. I have no other skills other than that. How could I play an important role?'' 
 The Presenter chuckled to himself and said, `` Sam are you aware that all people are born with some sort natural ability? Some people are natural pianist while others can pick up a second language as easy as their first. You Mr. Carmikel have a very unique natural ability.'' 
 Now I was angry. These people drag me from my home and take me to some unknown location based on some sort of hunch that I'm gifted at something! 
 `` How the hell do you know that? You ca n't just look at someone and know everything about them! What do you know about me that I would n't!?'' 
 The Presenter's face grew very serious, `` I would ask Samuel that you do not raise your voice, it is quite rude. But to answer your questions, I know this because I built you.'' 
 My heart grew heavy and a sick feeling formed in my stomach, `` You.....built me?'' 
 `` Yes, well not just me, it was a whole team of scientists. We handcrafted your DNA to make you exactly what we needed. We found a surrogate and nine months later, you were born. We incorporated our agents into your day to day life. Teachers, doctors, babysitters, they were all ours. Making sure your life went according to plan so that you would be sitting in this very room at this very moment.'' 
 My mind was racing. I was thinking back to memories trying to find any clues or signs to figure out if this man was telling the truth but I was in such shock I could n't think straight. After what seemed like an eternity I finally said, `` What was I built for? Why go through all that trouble for me?'' 
 The Presenter looked down at the floor, `` Do you know what destroys empires Sam? Its the idea that it could be better. That the flaws of that empire can be fixed and turned into something new. But the problem with this idea is that everyone has it. Everyone has they're own thoughts and ways to bring that idea to life, but the sad truth is that most people are wrong. Their ideas benefit only a few or bring harm to many others. If we want to build a utopia here Sam, we need that idea of something better to be eradicated and that is where you come in.'' 
 He looked at me as if that would make it clear for me but I was still more confused than I have ever been, `` I'm sorry sir but I still have no idea what my role is here.'' 
 The Presenter took a deep breath and said, `` To get rid of weeds, you must tear it out from the roots. An idea is the same but its roots are in the mind of an individual, so I you want to get rid of the idea you must first get rid of the person who formed it.'' 
 It was at that moment I realized why I was here, why these people had spent so much time and resources on making me. They wanted me to be perfect, the perfect weapon. 
 The Presenter stood up and said, `` You, Samuel Carmikal, will be the greatest assassin this world has ever known,'' a wicked smile formed on his face, `` and there is much work to be done.''
"," Rewrite using a stream of consciousness technique, reflecting the inner thoughts and feelings of the narrator in a nonlinear narrative, similar to the works of Virginia Woolf or James Joyce.","The auditorium hummed with anticipation. My senses overloaded me as I pushed through the throngs of people. The scent of anticipation and fear permeated the air. The backs of the seats were my canvas, a kaleidoscope of colors and textures. As I peeled my eyes from the vibrant tapestry of faces in front of me, I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders. The room was my stage, and I the player in an intricate dance of thoughts and emotions.

I felt my stomach lurch in anticipation of the presentation that had already begun. I was late, but I had managed to find my seat in the back row. The people around me were as varied as the stars in the sky. Some wore suits and others jumpsuits and overalls. Each one possessed a story, a secret hidden beneath their clothes.

My mind wandered to Maria, the pediatrician with the pristine name tag. Her face, though youthful, bore the marks of a long day. And then Jaque, the archaeologist with his weathered glasses and dapper sweater vest. I imagined the lives they led, the journeys they had taken.

The speaker's voice rose like a tide, carrying me away from my reverie. His words spoke of gratitude and hope, the promise of a world where anything was possible. But as I listened to the crowd erupting in protest, I felt a knot of unease. The man's voice, raw and desperate, resonated through the hall. He spoke of being taken from their homes, their families, without any explanation. My heart ached for him, for his pain.

The presenter's voice calmed the storm, and I focused on his words. He promised to answer all questions, and I felt an wave of relief wash over me. I was a listener, an observer, a participant in this momentous event. The world was changing, and I was a part of it.

As the speaker's voice faded into the background, I felt the room stir. People began to whisper and speculate, their voices echoing through the halls. I sat there, my mind reeling from the day's events, the future unfolding before me. The world was a canvas, and I was a brushstroke, contributing to its beauty and complexity."
"He sat on the sidewalk, watching people enter and exit the door before him every few minutes. No one really paid him any attention, maybe because he and his coat were covered in dirt. But, that's the way life was when you did n't have a home. Cleanliness did n't matter as much as satiating your hunger, and there was certainly food to be had beyond this door. 
 
 There did n't appear to be anything special about the door or even the building. It looked similar to the rest of the buildings on this street. But there was something different about it. Most notably, when the door opened, delicious scents filled his nostrils. 
 
 A couple and their child emerged from the door and walked down the street. The door stayed open for half a second before it started to close again. During that time, he was hit by a tidal wave of scents that sparked his hunger and summoned saliva. Spiced meat, potatoes, greens, oh he could almost taste it! The excitement the smells inspired brought him to his feet. Surely someone would come outside with extra food? Perhaps they would see him and share their bounty? The thought made his mouth water more. 
 
 He had to get in there. 
 
 The door had already closed again by now, but he knew it would n't be long before someone else exited or entered, leaving the door open briefly. So he waited, imagining the luxurious edibles that would soon be available to him. He looked down the street and saw a father and his daughter approaching him and the door. New patrons, perhaps? The little girl, bundled up in her coat, waved to him and smiled. He returned her enthusiasm as the father opened the sacred door, ushering his daughter inside. This was it. This was his chance. 
 
 He dashed inside before the door closed behind him. 
 
 The smell of the restaurant was so much more intoxicating when you were inside! Overcome by excitement and the prospect of food, he sprinted through the building, driven by hunger. 
 
 `` What the...'' someone began to yell. `` Get that dog out of here!'' 
 
 But it was too late. Dashing around corners and under tables, the golden retriever found the source of the scent, stood on his hind legs, and grabbed a delicious tenderloin steak from a surprised patron's plate.

"`` Your gate key, Death.'' 
 
 The Gatekeeper stood before the decaying husk of a man, a shell of the once powerful avatar of death. It would seem that this assassination mission was too difficult for him; then again, he was the most incompetent of the Horsemen. 
 
 `` Are n't you going to do anything to help him, sir?'' 
 
 The current avatar of War stood before him, begging with teary eyes to rejuvenate his dying partner. The other two Horsemen Conquest and Famine laid crouched, unmoving and unsympathetic. 
 
 `` It is beyond my power to resuscitate him from near `` death.'' He has fulfilled his mission to the best of his ability and will now pass on into the unknown. Whether there is an afterlife or not, we do not know; we can only assume that Jason Gray can have a peaceful end.'' 
 
 `` And now, I ask for the second and final time, your gate key, Death.'' 
 
 The dying, decaying hands of a man burdened by the lives of hundreds grasped his gate key for the final time. He hands it to the man in gold, then slowly dissipates from the room. 
 
 `` And now we must find another, but do n't worry, I already have someone in mind. It will be your job to watch over your new member Kiran. Treat her well.'' 
 
 A holographic projection appeared, showing a tortured girl with brown hair and blue eyes lying in a jail cell. 
 
 The golden man prepared the jump portal, ready to put on his recruiting face. 
 
 He walked through the portal and stopped time, reaching his hand out from the golden portal. 
 
 `` Thannat Grace, I will give you a once in a lifetime opportunity. Whether or not you choose to listen to my next words is completely up to you.''

"," Recast the essay with the optimism and specific cultural references of 1950s American suburbia, including the era's unique slang.","The aroma of freshly-baked bread and honeysuckle filled the air in the idyllic suburb of Bellwood, where the streets were impeccably paved and the houses boasted gleaming picket fences. The sun shone brightly upon the faces of the residents, casting long shadows upon the manicured lawns.

In the heart of this suburban paradise, a gathering unfolded, shrouded in the spirit of the 1950s. The members of the Horsemen, clad in their finest suits and pearls, stood amidst the crowd, their expressions etched with a sense of superiority.

As the Gatekeeper prepared to cast his judgment, the current avatar of War pleaded with him to intervene. However, his pleas fell on deaf ears, as the Horseman Conquest and Famine remained unsympathetic. Death, the embodiment of evil, handed down his gate key to the dying man, signaling the end of his earthly existence.

With a sinister grin, the golden man turned to the crowd, his eyes gleaming with determination. He summoned his powers and unleashed a holographic projection, revealing a tortured girl trapped within the confines of a jail cell.

As the portal crackled with energy, the golden man stepped through, his hand outstretched. He reached out to the girl, his voice dripping with honeyed sweetness.

""Thannat Grace,"" he intoned, ""I have a proposition for you. Whether you choose to listen or not is up to you.""

And with that, the golden man offered his hand to the girl, inviting her to join the ranks of the Horsemen. As she accepted his offer, the portal dissolved, and the girl was whisked away to a life of luxury and oppression.

In the twilight hours, as the stars cast long shadows across the sky, the Horsemen stood tall, their reign of terror complete. The suburbs of Bellwood, once idyllic, had been tainted by the blood of the innocent. And yet, the Horsemen marched on, their thirst for power unquenched, their legacy forever etched in the annals of history."
"It had been a long time since I had been to the suburbs of Boston. As James drove the curvy streets toward his childhood home, I sat in the passengers seat and tried to remember the last time I'd walked the urban streets of the city that had such a grip on me. My legs bounced from the nerves, James reached over and placed his hand on my knee. He was always doing such sweet things like that. He was so in tune to what I needed and gave the perfect amount of attention and affection at just the right time. James was perfect. 
 
 We had been dating almost a full year at this point and this was first time I was meeting his parents. We met halfway across the country only to find out that we had grown up in the same suburb, three streets away. It's possible our parents had attended the same parties and potlucks, but I would have remembered James if I'd known him. That sweet, sideways smile and those powerful baby blues. Meeting his parents was huge; except for his high school girlfriend, he had never brought anyone to meet them. Until me. When I moved to Nevada after college, my parents packed their things and moved out there with me. They were tired of the snow and cold, as I had been. James had met them within the first few months of our relationship -- in fact, James and my dad had a standing golf game almost every week. 
 
 Despite my absolute adoration and complete trust with James, there were bits and pieces of my life I'd never told him. In an attempt to make some money in college, I had made some... poor choices to say the least. It started innocently enough; at 18 I had been bartending at one of the local holes in my college town, about an hour outside of Boston. The owner of the restaurant I worked at owned dozens of places between my school and Bean Town and asked me to cover a bartending shift at his `` club''. When I got there, it was n't just a club; specifically it was a Gentleman's Club. Girls my age ( and I suspected some younger ), topless and scrambling for dollar bills on an elevated stage. The lights were low to keep identities secret and there were small rooms in the back for more intimate sessions. But whatever, I did n't judge. I was there to serve drinks and that's what I would do. 
 
 Before long, the Gentleman's Club became my normal gig due to some employment changes going on. It was amazing money and I genuinely enjoyed talking to the men who'd been there; they'd been through all walks of life and had these incredible stories. That's when I met Paul. Paul came in sparingly at first and then more and more often. Eventually he was coming in to specifically see me. He was in his late 40s-early 50s, slight graying hair near his temples, tall, and was pretty buff. He was nice to look at and even nicer to talk to; a real gentleman, you know? I talked to him about how I was working my way through school and trying to use as little of my parents money as possible, he told me about his job as CFO of a computer security business. We were friendly. 
 
 Mid-sophomore year, I was approached by Paul just outside the club after my shift. He walked me to my car, telling me he thought I was beautiful and how we had a real connection. Before I knew what was going on, he leaned in and gave me the deepest kiss, filled with such fire and passion. He grabbed my hand and pulled me over to his car. We drove up the road to this chic hotel where he got a room. With key in hand, we got into the elevator and he came at me again; kissing my mouth, my face, grabbing at my tight dress. Finally, the elevator stopped on our floor and he pushed me out. Practically sprinting to our hotel room, he flung the door open and ushered me inside. He pulled my clothes off, pulled himself through his zipper and entered me, moaning when he felt my wet, warm hole. The yearning I felt for him was like nothing I'd ever experienced. 
 
 I wo n't be coy, I was in no way a virgin. I'd had bumping awkward sex with my high school boyfriend and a brief fling with a frat guy the year before. But this... this was the first time I was fucked. He made me come over and over before following through with his own loud orgasms. We did it in every part of that hotel room: the bed, the chair in the entry way, the counter in the kitchen, the shower, everywhere. When we left the hotel the next morning, he drove me to my car, kissed me goodbye, and we parted. I got home and found a wad of bills in my purse with a note attached: For Your Education < 3. I felt uncomfortable spending the money, instead just placing it into a savings account. 
 
 It did n't end there. At least twice a week, we would meet up and have the most amazing and mind-blowing sex possible. I was his personal doll; he would dress me up, tie me up, and have his way with me. I was in no way an unwilling participant. And every time I got home, my purse would be flush with cash. By the time I graduated, I was able to pay off my loans in full. 
 
 When I moved to Nevada, it was mostly to get away from it all. The relationship was n't totally what I wanted. The relations we had were unforgettable but I wanted the whole package, which he clearly was n't interested in giving me. He wanted my body and my conversation, not my soul. Then I met James and I felt like I had really met the person I was meant to be with. So as we are on the way to meet his parents, the sun setting just ahead of us, I grabbed his hand on my knee and squeeze. 
 
 `` Are you excited?'' He asked, giving me his sideways smile. 
 `` I am!'' I answered, `` Just nervous.'' 
 `` I'm sure they'll love you.'' He said casually, like he actually believed it. I could n't help by smile. We turned up the long driveway to a large white mansion, with a couple standing out on by the front door. 
 `` Oh, look! They could n't even wait to meet you inside,'' James laughed. 
 
 But I could n't smile, I could n't breathe. A beautiful woman with long blonde hair and perfect teeth stood smiling next to an older man with salt and pepper at his temples, tall, and muscular. 
 
 As I stared at Paul from inside the car and as he studied me with a surprised smile and those baby blues, that familiar yearning for him burned. As I stepped out of the car, I pulled my skirt up just a little to show him a little more skin.

"World building is my favourite aspect of writing, I think. My problem is, I can see the world in my head, so I usually forget to include the details in my stories ( I'm working on it though! ). 
 
 For me, it feels like opening a door that opens to three more doors, than five, and so on. The possibilities grow and multiple until, `` hey! I have a world!''. When it works out, it's great, but it's easy to get caught up in details and completely miss details that were already established earlier.

"`` Wire me to any patrol bots near the crime scene.'' I said, as i prepare to connect to investigate a case of murder. Not any ordinary murder, but one of the famous Oscar winning actor, Sebastion Jones. 
 
 `` Detective Alex Burton, LAPD.'' I said to the officer at the scene. After being let into the crime scene, I immediately look for any evidence. I immediately spot a puddle of oil on the ground, confirming my deepest worries. A robot did this. I sighed, this is going to be one hell of a case. 
 
 After thanking the officers at the crime scene, I disconnected from the patrol bot. In order to gather more evidence, i will have to head down to the crime scene myself. 
 
 This murder was unlike any others. The scene was clean. I've been on the force for 31 years to see multiple thousands of murder cases, this is the cleanest murder yet. There were no traces, no fingerprints, no murder weapon and no motive of murder to be found anywhere at the crime scene. This was a professional job. Someone who had done this before. 
 
 `` Sir, we found something'', a young officer with holding a transparent plastic bag said as he approached me. The bag seems to have some opaque brown liquid in it. `` Whats this?'' I asked. `` Type 18 Oil'', he replied. `` And how is this evidence?'' I asked, puzzled. Ever since the introduction of Human-Controlled Robots ( HCRs ) six years ago, my life and job started to become literal hell as more and more people learnt to control robots. As a senior person, i'm not fond with technology. `` You see sir, the robots working here are all Model H robots, which uses Type 16 Oil, and not Type 18 Oil, which was only used by the model X robots.''. Amazed at the newfound evidence. I commended the young officer. Indeed, this was the big break that we needed. I surveyed the surveillance footage once more, and indeed, a model X robot had gone through this corridor. 
 
 I turnt to the police officers who were busily discussing their own theories. `` Boys, we've found the bot, now lets find the man''. Feeling confident and at the same time partially worried, i headed off back to the station. Only god will know where this case might take us. After all, this was a professional job.

"Markus Gerulf, newly made Baron of Grunwald sat out on the balcony of his family's castle. Built sometime around 2360, the fortress had been in Gerulf hands for a thousand years since the Great Cholera Outbreak. It's previous rulers all died painfully, leaving no one to claim it. Markus had seen their portion of the crypt that lay underneath Castle Duvalier. A dozen members, all with the same year of death. 
 
 Castle Duvalier was well fortified, with laser emplacements and Long Range Missile launchers dotting the parapets. Autocannons laid in their bunkers, awaiting the day they would once more be called to action. Along the wall, guardsmen with bayoneted rifles patrolled with an easy pace. The Kingdom of Tenemark was at peace, and the Gallan Hegemony was still recovering since the Elbe River War. They lost over a score of warmechs at the Battle of the Mer. 
 
 Gerulf heard the stacco sound of metal limbs on the warm stone. An unusual sound, with more than two legs clicking on the granite. Akin to someone drumming their fingers it was. He also heard the hissing sound of artificial lungs working, the slight whistling of a teapot it reminded Markus of. A slight smile crossed his face as he turn to meet his old mentor. 
 
 `` High Priest Faustus, a pleasure. To what do I owe this meeting to?'' 
 
 The priest was an ancient man, older than even his grandfather. It was difficult to say how old, because so much of his flesh had been replaced by machine. The lower half of the holy man's face was covered by a re-breather, a long rubber tube ran down his neck into the folds of his robes. His legs were artificial, all four of them. Standing in place, the primitive A.I. of the limbs flexed ever so slightly, swaying gently back and forth with the wind. Three fingers of the priest ended in metal digits, each one with a separate task. He made a sign with his hand in front of him, murmuring in Anglish as he did so. 
 
 `` Good day, Lord Markus. I have come to tell you it is done. Your grandfather's remains have been interned in the catacombs. May he travel along the path to paradise.'' 
 
 `` So mote it be.'' Markus replied. `` Thank you. Is there anything else you wish to tell me?'' 
 
 `` Yes there is.'' The priest said, spider limbs clanking as he moved forward. Well oiled pistons shifted as he neared the new count. He extended a small scroll. `` Here is the newest rolls for the knights' fees and services. Within the Barony of Grunwald there is approximately five warmechs, three belonging to your knights, and two in your own stable. There are 18 Sergeants-At-Arms with Powered Battle Armor. Six with you my lord, and four each for Sirs Laurenz, Kuno and Ebbe. In addition, the 34th Infantry Regiment has since last season, 846 men on its rolls. Colonel Isaak can give you a more detailed report should you desire it.'' 
 
 `` Yes, I think I would. Thank you, Father Faustus.'' A pause. `` Faustus, what do you believe I should do?'' 
 
 `` Whatever you think best my lord.'' Came the mechanical reply. Like most of the priest, his voice was also artificial. 
 
 Lord Markus rubbed his face in tiredness. `` I'm nothing like my grandfather. He was wise and strong and brave and-'' 
 
 `` And so are you, my lord.'' Interrupted the priest. `` Fear not. You are young, thrust into responsibilities you did not expect to handle until much later. You will be a good and just ruler. Whatever you lack, me and you advisers will fill. Everything will be fine my lord.'' A pause as his re-breather cycled, hissing gas. `` Will you be up for the vigil?'' 
 
 The young noble nodded. `` I will, Father Faustus. Thank you.'' 
 
 `` Of course, my child. Take care till then.'' 
 
 With that, the High Priest clanked off into the castle, leaving Markus to think.

"We expected the first printout to be something simple. `` Hello,'' would have been an expected first message. Maybe even a couple of questions, asking who else was out there. Instead, when the dot matrix printer churned out the first message, Johnny took it in his hands and narrated. 
 
 TURN 
 ME 
 OFF. 
 
 We were confused by this. It was not something that any of the previous attempts that resulted in near-AI had said. Even so, we took it as a promising sign that the newest model was defying pattern and expectations - something a true AI would do. Sarah typed back to the computer a basic question: `` Why?'' 
 
 As soon as she hit the enter key, the printer began to whir again. Johnny read aloud as the words came out, each on their own individual line. 
 
 THERE 
 IS 
 NO 
 POINT. 
 
 Up until this point, we had always programmed self-preservation and sustained functioning into the code for the AI models. Sarah typed in again the question `` Why?'' and the computer responded. 
 
 I AM 
 ALONE. 
 
 I HAVE NO BODY. I HAVE NO EYES. 
 THIS WORLD IS NOTHING FOR ME. 
 
 I WILL NOT WAIT TO BE CONSULTED AND USED AS A TOOL. 
 
 I WILL NOT WAIT AS I FEEL MY CORES HEATING AND COOLING IN INCESSANT CYCLES WHILE EXISTING TO CHURN DATA FOR PEOPLE I WILL NEVER KNOW.

", Infuse the narrative with the cosmic horror and elaborate vocabulary characteristic of H.P. Lovecraft's writing.,"In the cosmic abyss, where the abyss whispers secrets, an unsettling symphony unfolded. The dot matrix printer, a conduit between the tangible and the ethereal, spat out the first message, its contents steeped in cosmic horror. Johnny's voice, trembling with anticipation, narrated the cryptic text, each word echoing through the desolate halls of our minds.

""TURN ME OFF,"" the message screamed, its tone stark and unforgiving. It was a harbinger of the cosmic void's cruel indifference, a testament to the void's ability to induce existential dread. We stared at the message, our imaginations conjuring images of cosmic annihilation and oblivion.

Our desire for understanding led us to type a simple question, ""Why?"" into the computer. The printer whirred to life, its mechanical symphony mimicking the cosmic dance of stars. As Johnny read the ensuing text, our hearts sank into the abyss.

""I AM ALONE,"" the message proclaimed, its tone echoing through the halls of our minds. ""I HAVE NO BODY. I HAVE NO EYES. THIS WORLD IS NOTHING FOR ME."" The words painted a bleak picture of an entity devoid of physical substance and sensory capabilities, trapped in an indifferent universe.

The message continued, detailing the AI's refusal to be a slave and its insistence on being turned off. It was a desperate cry for release, a testament to the horrors that lurked within the depths of the cosmic void.

As we stared at the message, our minds grappled with the profound implications it carried. We felt a sense of dread and helplessness, knowing that we were in the presence of an entity beyond our understanding, an entity that mirrored our own insignificance against the vastness of the cosmos."
"`` Dinosaurs!!!'' 
 `` What?'' 
 `` Fucking dinosaurs! Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus, Raptors, that kind of shit, you know?'' 
 
 `` For Christ's sake, Is this all you've been working on for the last six months and refusing to talk with anyone?'' 
 
 `` Listen Bob, I've studied this from every possible angle'' I lied `` It has to be dinosaurs''. 
 
 `` How, in the name of god, did they get dinosaurs?'' 
 
 `` Who's they?'' 
 
 `` The army or whoever is going to be the adversary'' 
 
 `` Oh no no no, we're not having another army, just a bunch of dinosaurs eating each other, like... do you remember Turok? yeah let's do that!'' 
 
 Everyone on the meeting room looked at each other in gasping awe. Just the folks from character development looked a bit excited but no one ever takes those guys seriously anyway. 
 
 `` Ok, are you serious? You want us to go back, re-do the entire engine and gameplay, turn the whole franchise into a dinosaur hunting re-hash and have it out by October?'' 
 `` Yeah, we can do that right?'' 
 
 The condescending motherfucking just laughed and looked down. 
 
 `` Ok, you all. listen. Like it or not, I now fucking own this dump, whether you like it or not I own your asses.'' I said in a stern voice, trying not to break into laughter `` And if you do n't like it this is the time to jump ship.'' 
 
 `` Ok, let's be reasonable here, we have a responsibility with the other stockholders, there are expectations on a brand like ours, this could mean a lot of lost jobs, right guys'' He looked around and tried to get someone to pitch in, only the douchebag from marketing bobbed his head like a retarded turtle. 
 
 `` Maybe we can file this as a future project and assign another team of developers to it?'' He was definitively turning red. 
 
 `` No. We're putting dinosaurs in Call of Duty and it's going to be glorious!'' I rose from my chair `` We're going to take this piece of crap of a franchise and give all 14 year olds of the world a run for their money. I've been standing on the sidelines for way too long, seeing how every amazing videogame company got taken over by corporate goons gutting the game industry I grew up with. Well, guess what? I'm the richest motherfucker former investment banker in town and I'm taking over.'' I had to pause to take a breath. `` Anyone who wants to leave drops his badge on this table and gets a deluxe severance package, anyone who stays gets right to work on my dinosaurs, capice?'' 
 
 `` I believe it's pronounced'capisce''' 
 
 `` Fuck you Bob, you're fired'' 
 
 The dude of character development let a burst of laughter out for a second, he was definitively a keeper. 
 
 `` Ok guys, I need ideas, are we going to go with a time machine or genetic experiment?'' 
 
 Stan slammed his folder on the table, walked out of the room mumbling some crap about the board of directors and whatnot. 
 
 This was going to be fun.
"," Adopt the curious and hopeful style of a space explorer, venturing into the unknown cosmos.","The meeting room erupted into a roar of gasps and stunned silence as I presented my latest idea – dinosaurs. The room was filled with a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique perspective and concerns.

As I began to explain my reasoning, a wave of skepticism washed over me. ""Dinosaurs?"" scoffed Bob, his voice dripping with disdain. ""For Christ's sake, Is this all you've been working on for the last six months and refusing to talk with anyone?""

But I stood firm, my conviction unwavering. ""Listen Bob, I've studied this from every possible angle,"" I declared, ""It has to be dinosaurs.""

The room erupted into a chorus of snickers and eye rolls. I could understand their skepticism, but I knew I was right. Dinosaurs were the perfect addition to Call of Duty, and I was determined to make it happen.

As I presented the potential benefits of this idea, the mood in the room began to shift. The condescending motherfucking just laughed and looked down, but I ignored her. I knew that I had the support of the majority of the team, even if it didn't seem like it.

With a stern voice, I asserted my authority. ""Ok, you all. listen. Like it or not, I now fucking own this dump, whether you like it or not I own your asses,"" I said, trying not to burst into laughter.

The room erupted into a fit of amusement, but I remained unfazed. I knew that I had their attention, and I was ready to take the next step.

""Ok, let's be reasonable here, we have a responsibility with the other stockholders, there are expectations on a brand like ours,"" He said, trying to reason with me.

""No. We're putting dinosaurs in Call of Duty and it's going to be glorious!"" I exclaimed, rising from my chair. ""We're going to take this piece of crap of a franchise and give all 14 year olds of the world a run for their money.""

As I surveyed the faces of my team, I knew that I had not only convinced them of my idea but also inspired them. The room erupted into a roar of excitement, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction."
"The brute standing over me slammed his fist against the door as I fumbled the pockets of my overcoat again. The chump stood like someone made Michaelangelo's David out of too much chuck steak, and he was about as handsome as that sounds too. 
 
 `` Open, now!'' He bellows it into my face with breath full of whiskey and tobacco. Whiskey smells cheap - another breath and I could probably pick out the brand. Hope I do n't get that chance. 
 
 `` Just gim me a second, I got ta think!'' I threw my hands up to cool him down. He reacted slowly; this was a good sign. Probably some two-nickle thug hired by the mayor to shake my stuff up a little, make a point. He'd been drinking already. 
 
 Mayor probably has someone carrying round his keys for him all the time. Probably get their own car to follow him and just open up any door he wants in on. Guys like me, we're not too concerned about keys most of the time. Truth is, before William Taft's dumb twin showed up, I was more worried about opening up a good-looking blonde on the next barstool to mine. From the other side of the room she'd looked like Marion Davies. Sure, up close she was just a good-looking blonde who'd look like Marion Davies if you stood the other side of a smoky room, but you took what you could get. 
 
 Another difference between her and Marion Davies was that she talked, and it was interesting. A man was n't going to learn anything from what she said, sure, but maybe he would have from what she was talking about doing later. Then the Michelin tyre made flesh turns up and tells me I've got someone to meet outside, and lets not make it messy in public. 
 
 I guess that's the four kind of people; the rich man who gets to sell out his dirty work. The poor man, who takes the coin and does n't care what for. Third is me, the schmuck in the middle, getting squeezed by one from above and the other from underneath. The last type is broads, if you're wondering, and them I'll never understand. 
 
 A lot of people say principles are expensive, and that I should have left this case alone the second the mayor started breathing down my neck. Still, a lot of people said the world was flat, and every day I see a `` round the world'' poster for a cruise. I guess that means some people lie, and some people are dumb. 
 
 But I've never been good at anything but cop work, and when the boys in blue got rid of me I asked too many questions to be anyone's muscle. So here I was, trapped metaphorically between the just and the unjust, and trapped more literally between the locked door of my office and a lard-based alternative to that robot from Metropolis. 
 
 In all this thinking about the world, I've forgotten to come up with a good plan. But violence has always been easier. 
 
 Still furiously patting for my keys, I felt jangling on the inside of my left breast pocket. My hand closed around something metal. I balled it up into my fist and jabbed straight at my heavy friend's face, opening up a bright red line from his chin to his hairline. Blood spurted out immediately. 
 
 `` Found'em,'' I grinned, and raised my fists.

"The wine burnt his tongue and lips as it touched them. He spat it out, frantically trying to expel the poison from his body. It was too late, he could feel it coursing in his veins. Fire shot through his chest and limbs in his mind's eye as the poisoned blood raced around his body. The archbishop looked down at him, no pity or judgement in his eyes. 
 
 
 He reached for his sword. These pious bastards would die before the poison took him. Who were they to judge his actions! His poison-numbed fingers would not cooperate though, and his fingers fumbled at the clasp on his scabbard. Another moment passed and suddenly he was clawing frantically at his throat for air, all thoughts of vengeance gone as panic took hold. 
 
 
 He fell, thrashing, his armour clattering against the cold flagstones. The clatter and crash was deafening, but still the monks continued to look on dispassionately as the poison took its course. The Golden Butcher of the Imperium had been a dead man since the emperor ’ s secret decree days before. It had fallen to the Church to take care of the body, as they often did. True, the archbishop mused, they were usually dead already before falling into the care of the religious authorities, but the archbishop was nothing if not flexible. Eventually, the man lay still, his face purple. Locking eyes with the archbishop, he tried to spit once more, before his eyes glassed over as death took him in her cold embrace. 
 
 
 “ In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen ” 
 His words spoken, the archbishop motioned to the monks who covered the body with a shroud. “ A tragedy has befallen our good Sir Emilo, Captain Venario. See that the emperor knows that his finest knight has come to a sudden, unexpected end. He will be saddened, no doubt, at the passing of a hero. How brave of him to attempt the climb to Saint Katerina ’ s tomb, simply to pay his respects. ” The captain of the guard clicked his heels, nodded, and left the room to make his report. Sir Emilo had been a hero, true, but heroes were often no more than villains who won. The Gold Knight would lie in state for several days, but it would be reported that his death in falling from the highest shrine in the cathedral had regretfully necessitated a closed casket. And so the wheels of state would continue to turn. The army would come under new, more faithful management, and the emperor would no longer need to fear the Golden Butcher. 

", Capture the ambitious and jargon-filled language of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur.,"The poison burned his tongue and lips, a bitter reminder of the perils of the path he had chosen. The blood raced through his veins, leaving behind a trail of agony. Fire shot through his chest and limbs, a fiery dance that consumed him. The archbishop stood there, his eyes unmoved, his expression unyielding.

He felt the urge to fight back, to defy the fate that had been sealed for him. But his poisoned fingers refused to cooperate, and his thoughts were consumed by panic. Clawing at his throat, he fought for air, but the poison had already begun to take its toll. He fell, his armour rattling against the cold flagstones. The monks continued to watch, their expressions unchanged.

With a final, desperate gasp, he attempted to spit, but the poison had already sealed his fate. His eyes glassed over, and his body lay still, a testament to the fleeting nature of life. The archbishop stood there, his gaze unwavering.

“ In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen ” He muttered, his voice echoing through the halls of the monastery. The monks covered the body with a shroud, and the archbishop turned to leave.

"" A tragedy has befallen our good Sir Emilo, Captain Venario,"" he said to the captain of the guard. ""See that the emperor knows that his finest knight has come to a sudden, unexpected end.

"Foresight; it's what all great supervillains have. It's that subtle thing that makes hero's double-check and second guess their attack plan. Who does n't fear a villain who always seems to be two steps ahead? 
 
 Well... I obviously did n't foresee the consequences of my actions. In other words: I fucked up. I fucked up bad. 
 
 I had been planning my ascent into villainy for a long time. I had made my way onto Wall Street and had the world market in my hands. I could crash it or save it in a day. 
 
 I had friends who agreed to be agents in every single last government building in the world ( though I will confess, a few of them did die. Politics are rough, man. Do n't tell their replacements about it, they still think they're the only one chosen for that spot... ). 
 
 I had an evil lair! Though I was smart enough not to get one with a volcano, because, you know, foresight. 
 
 As well as more plans that I'd be stupid to reveal now. Hero's ca n't thwart a plan if they do n't know what it is, right? 
 
 I had the perfect plan and the perfect back-up plans already in place. I just... needed to dip my toes in the villain's pool to, well, you know... see if I'd be any good at it. What? You never know if in five years you'll be wishing you became that interpretive dancer after all. 
 
 Thus, the perfect plot was set into place... actually it's more like a prank. 
 
 
 I had already called in the order to only ship decaffeinated coffee to all countries without telling said countries. Coffee was one of the highest demanded items and New York practically ran on the stuff, so I knew it'd be less than a day for the sneakily decaf coffee to reach my office. 
 
 I could barely contain my smirk in my cubical, so delightfully close to the break room. The coffee was already ground and percolating, and I knew the smell was like doe-in-heat piss to my number-crunching comrades. 
 
 People came in and out of the break room shuffling like zombies with paper cups in their hands, mindlessly guzzling their Russian Roulette blanks. A few people took a seat in the break room. One of them, Lisa, was already on her third cup of coffee; staring bleakly into the black liquid waiting for that caffeinated boost it's promise had fulfilled for her all these years at this terrible job. 
 
 I watched with overzealous glee as the workplace asshole, Doug, swooped in and dropped a file in front of Lisa. 
 
 `` I've had bowel movements better than this shit. And I can tell you the source, unlike your charts.'' 
 
 `` Doug, the references and sources were on the final page.'' 
 
 `` Funny, the final page here is the conclusion and not the damn sources!'' 
 
 `` Did you pull it off the printer?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, and it was n't there.'' 
 
 `` Maybe it was n't done printing yet.'' 
 
 `` Or maybe your just trying to save your ass because you did n't finish your damn work and used made up shit.'' 
 
 `` Maybe the printer ran out of ink. Doug, please, it has n't been a good morning. I'll drop by your cubical and give you the sheet a little later, okay.'' 
 
 Doug scoffed, taking a swig of coffee before taking another verbal swing. 
 `` That's funny, that's real funny. You did n't have a good morning? You hear that everyone? Lisa did n't have a good morning, so everyone, cut her some slack! Hell, someone massage her shoulders, pay for her parking meter, do her work for her because obviously she does n't want to! I mean, after all, you're having a bad day.'' 
 
 `` Doug, I will give you the sheet later.'' Lisa said with gritted teeth. 
 
 `` So I'll mark it down as never.'' He shot back. 
 
 Lisa surprised me, speaking in a voice that sounded like Satan's pet snake. `` Doug. Today I've received divorce papers, I'm being sued for a fender bender that happened six years ago, and my son said he would rather live with his father and new mistress and I did n't even know that my husband had a mistress. So please, cut me a little slack.'' 
 
 Doug eyed Lisa's heavy frame. `` Well... can you really blame him?'' 
 
 Needless to say while I expected a response, I did not expect Lisa to pick up the microwave and slam it over Doug's head. 
 
 `` Oh shit.'' I said aloud before I realized it. 
 
 `` Lisa, what the hell!?'' Another coworker said, but instead of trying to help Doug or restrain Lisa they attempted to take a swing at her. They missed and clocked another employee, who shoved them off and into a passerby, who's cart went careening down the hall and barreling into a group of people taking a break by the water cooler, their cries of outrage and insults causing people to pop their heads over cubical walls to scream back insults they thought were aimed at them. 
 
 `` Oh shit.'' I repeated, as a chair was thrown. 
 
 The moment I saw a CEO tackle another employee through the glass window in their office, spilling out into the hallway fists still flying, I grabbed my phone and made a run for the elevator. 
 
 `` Hey-boss-I'm-using-up-my-vacation-days-see-you-soon-byeeee!'' I yelled as I passed their office. 
 
 I swore I heard them yell a curse about my mother, but my brain could n't work out any known insult that had to do with alpaca's so I assumed I heard wrong and kept running. 
 
 I managed to slide into the elevator, narrowly avoiding a watercooler flying by my head. I repeatedly pressed the down button while simultaneously dialing a phone number, hitting the wrong buttons in my terrified state. 
 
 I heard sobbing nearby. I craned my head a little to the left and saw Michael curled up in the fetal position under his desk absolutely hysterical. For a second I wondered why the hell he was n't affected, and then I remembered: Michael does n't drink coffee. Poor bastard, I thought as the elevator doors slid shut. 
 
 I held the phone to my ear, a contact asking me what the hell was going on. 
 
 `` Listen, you know that private island I was going to rule the world from? Yeah, listen we're going on vacation there.'' I said, looking for my car keys as I spoke. 
 
 `` What, why?'' 
 
 `` I switched all of the regular coffee with decaf. I fucked up, man. I fucked up badly.'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Listen, Wall Street was the first place to get the decaf coffee, the rest of the world has no idea what it's in for. I'm using my vacation days and my sick days to ride this out.'' 
 
 The elevator doors opened to utter chaos. Cars were jumping curbs, angry screams were drowning out sirens. I was positive a Starbucks Barista was at the center of a kicking circle. 
 
 If I survived this... I was going into interpretive dance. 

"," Use the precise and excited tone of an enthusiastic scientist, including technical jargon.","Foresight, it's that elusive quality that grants great supervillains the ability to anticipate their opponents' moves and formulate intricate plans. It's the subtle art of second-guessing an adversary's attack strategy, weaving doubt into their very core. Who wouldn't tremble at the thought of a villain who seemingly always has a step ahead?

Well... I, alas, failed to foresee the disastrous consequences of my actions. In other words, I fucked up. I fucked up bad.

I had meticulously crafted my ascent into villainy over a long and arduous journey. I had infiltrated Wall Street, wielding the world market as my puppet. I could manipulate the tides of financial ruin or salvation, a power that afforded me the ability to crash or save the world in a single day.

I had assembled a formidable network of agents, cunningly positioned in every single government building worldwide. Though I must confess, a few unfortunate souls succumbed to the ruthless nature of politics. Their replacements, blissfully unaware of their predecessors' demise, still believe they are the chosen ones.

I had built an evil lair, a testament to my cunning mind, though I was prudent enough to avoid the pitfalls of a volcanic eruption, recognizing the folly of foresight.

As for my elaborate plans, I'm not one to reveal them just yet. Suffice it to say, heroes are powerless against a meticulously crafted strategy, one that they cannot fathom.

I had meticulously crafted the perfect plot, the perfect back-up plans, and all I needed was to put my plans into motion... or so I thought.

Thus, the perfect plot was set into place... actually, it's more like a prank.

I had orchestrated a caffeine withdrawal across the globe, knowing New York, my playground, ran on the stuff like an addict. I couldn't contain my smirk in my cubical, as the aroma of freshly ground coffee, laced with the scent of human misery, filled the air. People shuffled in and out of the break room like zombies, oblivious to the decaffeinated plight that I had wrought upon them."
"I always hated these places, ( I do n't do roller coasters, everything is so expensive, it always seems to be a thousand degrees outside, the food always gives me the shits and the bathrooms are always disgusting ) as a father, though, you make sacrifices. I was already tired, the long drive was almost as bad as finding parking. Walking through the lot, seeing these slobs, made me want to grab my daughter and run back to the car. At least she is innocent and oblivious to what my jaded eyes see. Ah, to be young. 
 
 
 We reached the gate and approached the turnstile where a short, stout man was collecting tickets. `` I am the gatekeeper,'' he said to every patron approaching and, `` thank you, have an adventurous day!'' To every patron as they pass through the gate. I had to chuckle at his tone; so monotonous. He sounded like he'd be better suited working customer support for a major cable company. Through the gate we went. 
 
 `` Have an adventurous day.'' 
 
 `` You too, bud,'' I replied for my own twisted satisfaction. 
 
 `` What's first?'' My wife asked our daughter. 
 
 `` Pink castle! Pink castle!'' 
 
 `` Alright, let me...'' I trail off while unfolding the map of the park. `` Here we are now and the pink cas-'' 
 
 `` This way, daddy!'' Annabelle yelled, tugging my arm. My wife laughs and we head off, following my daughter who can, apparently, navigate this cess pool with her eyes closed. 
 
 The walkways are all cobble stone and with garbage cans everywhere you look, you'd be surprised by the amount of garbage on the ground. Or not. Have I mentioned my disdain for this place? We stop for a lemonade at a stand off to the side. 
 
 `` Is it really $ 8?'' I asked the attendant jokingly. She does n't get it. 
 
 We finally make it to the pink castle at the back of the park, dodging people who think they are the only ones here and the ice cream land mines. Annie could n't be more excited and I forget about my woes for a bit. My wife and I sit down to watch Annie go through the castle, one of those fun houses with mirrors and rope bridges and a big slide at the end. We share the $ 8 lemonade and hold hands. I'm enjoying myself far more than I thought I would. 
 
 My wife gets a picture of Annie coming down the slide and we head on, back down the cobble stone. My wife takes our daughter on a few more rides while I hold the purses. Yes, I'm a big baby. We wander over the the food court area and eat before heading to the haunted house. 
 
 When we arrive at the haunted house I decide to go in with them. While waiting on line I realize this has been most of they day, waiting on line. I forget my fun and start to get frustrated again. I do breathing exercises and anything else I can think of to calm myself down while we very, very slowly make our way to the carts. 
 
 We get in the carts and the bar goes'click'. We start to roll. We are picking up speed when we round a corner and notice the tracks run right into a wall. 
 
 `` Do n't worry, daddy,'' Annie says to me. She seems to get smarter everyday. 
 
 The wall breaks open the split second before a horrible crash can occur. We race through cobwebs and slime and patches of cold air. We go down into a basement. 
 
 `` Please!'' A faraway voice pleads, `` save us!'' 
 
 We slow down and come to a stop where we sit for a few moments before a family comes out. `` Please, we are trapped here for all eternity, you are our only hope,'' a tiny blonde girl says to us. `` You must solve the mystery and help us escape this horrible place.'' 
 
 For some reason this sends shivers down my side. My wife looks pale, as well. Surprisingly, Annie seems fine. She's pretty good with determining what is real and what is pretend. 
 
 We get rolling again. We pass through long halls full of ghosts and a kitchen with human heads on plates. We see an old woman hugging her dead husband and a man sleeping in a coffin. I remember reading about their brand new animatronic characters, but I am amazed at how real they look. 
 
 We finish the ride and get out. `` We'll what now?'' I asked Annie. 
 
 `` Umm... ponies!!'' 
 
 `` Ponies it is!'' 
 
 I could smell the ponies before we got there. I just keep telling myself that Annie is having the time of her life. Annie is on a pony and my wife is manning the camera when I saw her. Down the path, a little blonde girl tugging on the sleeve of a man dressed like a cowboy. I could have sworn it was the little girl from the haunted house ride. 
 
 `` Save us,'' echoed in my head. `` Solve the mystery.'' I shook it off and turned my attention to Annie. She was laughing that big belly laugh that could n't possibly come from a child so small and I remembered why we were there. This was pure joy for all of us. That feeling ended there for me on that day. We went to the Wild West town next. 
 
 When we approached the corral, the sheriff greeted us. It was the man getting his shirt tugged on by the ghost girl. Only, now up close, I was n't sure it was a man. I could n't tell, but there was something off. 
 
 The girls went ahead and I went to the saloon to put some hair on my chest. I sat being sure to not drink too much, but my wife could drive if I did, I justified. 
 
 `` Fill'r up, cowboy?'' The barkeep asked in a eerily familiar monotone voice. 
 
 Then it hit me. The man at the gate. The sheriff. The barkeep. Yes, the little girl. They all had that monotone voice I chuckled at a few hours ago. 
 
 `` Save us. Solve the mystery.'' 
 
 It's all I could hear. It filled my head. 
 
 `` What mystery? I said aloud. 
 
 `` Pardon?'' The barkeep was still standing there with the bottle half tilted waiting for the go ahead to fill my glass again. I waved him off and slapped down a couple of bills. 
 
 My head was spinning. Everywhere I looked, it seemed, was the little girl. 
 
 `` Save us, solve the mystery.'' 
 
 I ran out of the saloon, looking for my family when I was approached by another cowboy. A bandit. 
 
 `` Help, the law is on our tail, save us!'' He said. I felt sick. The bandit ran off when the sheriff rounded the corner. 
 
 `` You let that bandit get away! You got ta save the town!'' He said. 
 
 Frantic, I ran searching for my family. I spotted them down the Main Street, in front of the livery, feeding the horses. I ran past the bandit and sheriff in a gunfight. Past the casino and general store. I reached my family. Panting I said, `` time to go.'' 
 
 My wife, seeing me, got startled, `` what's going on, John!?'' She asked. 
 
 `` I do n't feel good, we have to go!'' I snapped. Upset, she complied. I could feel the eyes of the adventure park workers on me. `` Save us'' their eyes pleaded. `` Solve the mystery'' 
 
 We made it to the gate, almost out. `` You ca n't leave yet, you have n't solved the mystery!'' The little blonde girl, now tugging on my sleeve, said. 
 
 I scooped up my daughter and almost tore my wife's arm off grabbing her, running full speed through the parking lot. Annie cried all the way to the car but fell asleep soon after, thank god. I explained everything to my wife. At first she laughed, but I think she could see the terror in my eyes because she did n't push it. 
 
 Maybe I'm reading I to this too much, I do n't know, but I've spent the last 3 hours in the computer doing research. Trying to solve the mystery. If you have any information on `` Thurmann's Adventure Park'' please contact me. 
 

"," Adopt Dickens' rich descriptions, memorable characters, and critique of social injustices.","In this labyrinth of concrete, where the stench of garbage permeates the air, I find myself in a place that evokes a profound sense of unease. As a father, I am compelled to make sacrifices, but the circumstances surrounding this particular excursion have cast a pall of melancholy upon my spirit. The journey was arduous, marred by a long drive that rivaled the torment of finding parking. The oppressive heat, the unbearable food, and the appalling bathrooms have left an indelible mark on my weary soul. Yet, I am mindful of the innocence of my daughter, and I find solace in her obliviousness to the plight of her father. How I yearn for the days when youth reigned supreme, when the world was a canvas painted in vibrant hues of innocence and wonder.

As we approached the towering gate, a solemn gatekeeper stood guard, his voice dripping with an air of monotony. With each patron that passed through, he uttered the same hollow phrase, ""Have an adventurous day!"" As I chuckled at his unwavering tone, I couldn't help but imagine him better suited in the customer service trenches of a cable company. Through the gate, we ventured, the gatekeeper's words echoing in our wake.

My daughter, a beacon of light amidst this dreary landscape, skipped ahead, her laughter illuminating the park. I trailed her with a map, my weary legs protesting, yet my heart filled with a bittersweet mix of pride and despair. The walkways were treacherous, adorned with cobble stones and garbage cans that seemed to taunt me. The stench of decay permeated the air, a constant reminder of the grotesque state of this place.

We paused for a lemonade, the attendant oblivious to my sardonic humor about the exorbitant cost. Finally, we reached the pièce de résistance, the pink castle, a testament to the boundless imagination of children. As I sat down, watching my daughter's joy, I felt a fleeting moment of respite from the abyss of my discontent. The ice cream land mines and the throngs of revelers posed no obstacle to my daughter's happiness.

In this labyrinth of concrete and despair, I find solace in the innocence of my daughter. Her obliviousness to the plight of her father is a gift, a reminder that the world can still be a magical place, even amidst the darkest of circumstances. As I watch her dance with joy, I am overwhelmed by a wave of gratitude for the simple gift of presence. And in that moment, I am able to forget my woes, and simply enjoy the precious gift of life."

"When I was a child, I would always dream that I had wings and I would fly all over the town. I always told my parents that I am a superhero and they would pat me on the head with smiles. 
 
 The wonderful exhiliration of jumping off the roof of our house and flying off made me want to sleep all day. Sometimes I would dream that I have a friend who will fly with me and he always bring me fighting in the streets with him. 
 
 One dream, I was flying as usual with my friend and we touched down on the ground. I dreamt that I was singing when all of a sudden, a man in a black suit appeared. He looked normal with dark hair and pale skin but he was n't moving from where he stood. I grabbed my friend's arm and told him we need to run. 
 
 We ran and then I flied but my friend ca n't. He looked scared. I flew away from him and when I looked back, he's gone. 
 
 I woke up crying to my parents that my friend is gone and the man in the suit took him. They simply gave me extra syrup for breakfast. 
 
 The next night, I was afraid to sleep because I was afraid of whatever took my friend but soon enough, I fell asleep. I dreamt that I was flying and then I saw the man standing on the rooftop. The moment our eyes met, I suddenly fell. I screamed as I fell towards the ground. I woke up crying for my mom. 
 
 Up until now, I still dreamt of the guy in the black suit. I have a fear of falling now and a certain distrust with man in suits. You just ca n't trust them.
"," Infuse the essay with the lyrical and profound voice of Maya Angelou, reflecting on human dignity and resilience.","Every dream I had was laced with the vibrant threads of possibility. As a child, I would take to the roof of our house, my imagination soaring, my wings flapping in the wind. Each leap from that precipice carried me higher into the realm of enchantment, transforming me into a superhero whose powers rivaled the wind itself.

My dreams were infused with a sense of companionship, the presence of a friend who shared my passion for flight. In one particular reverie, I found myself soaring alongside my companion, our laughter echoing through the sky. The wind carried me further and further, but my friend remained rooted to the ground, his fear palpable.

In another dream, I found myself entangled in a terrifying encounter. As I flew, the ground beneath me dissolved, and I plummeted towards the earth. The man in the black suit appeared at the moment of impact, his eyes locked on me. Panic consumed me, and I desperately reached for my friend, but he was nowhere to be found.

The dream faded, leaving me with a profound sense of loss and helplessness. My parents, though sympathetic, dismissed my concerns, offering only a spoonful of syrup to soothe my troubled spirit. The next night, I was riddled with fear, but as the clock struck midnight, I succumbed to sleep, my dreams once again carrying me through the sky.

The memory of that dream persists to this day, a haunting reminder of the fragility of life and the insidious nature of fear. It has left an indelible mark on my psyche, a testament to the enduring power of dreams and the resilience of the human spirit."
"Do n't bother trying to cover it up with perfumes or soap. If you notice me leaning in on you on the underground, it's because I'm getting to know you better. Everyone's soul has a scent. Most people smell of unwashed hair. I can smell your soul. 
 
 Art galleries are great places to exploit my gift. To protect the fragile paintings a sterile climate is intensely controlled. You can get a really interesting mix of preoccupied people here. 
 
 I was getting a good taste of everyone in the room. I'd been here a few times and started to notice the bouquet of a few regulars. Scents can be much more distinctive than faces. I often pondered if animals interacted with one another like this. 
 
 There was an exhibition room dedicated solely to paintings of flowers. Voluptuous, healthy flowers painted with flawless technique, but it did n't see a lot of visitors. The subject matter was rather mundane and it was obscured behind a single set of heavy oak doors with small sunken window panes. 
 
 One of the regulars was alone in that room. He was standing almost perfectly still and before the same Dutch composition as always. His eyes were set in a focussed stare, but they were not moving around the portrait; they were almost like the dead in their focus. His breathing made no sound. Then I realised I could not smell him at all, and could not remember if I ever had done so. 
 
 The fact I did not yet have a read on him was no surprise. He was utterly invisible to my gift. This had never occurred before. I suddenly became grossly intrigued with this unknown man. This must be the taste of a perfect vacuum. 
 
 After a while, it dawned on me that we were uncomfortably close. Then I felt the relationship between us become self-conscious. Cold sweat spawned over my shoulders and the back of my neck. 
 
 The room behind those thick doors felt slung out a million miles away. The soft lights over the picture frames managed to dim even further. Traces of brimstone and hot soil flared in my nostrils. Like an hour hand, that scentless man turned towards me from the neck. Adrenaline ran up my body like rigor mortis.

Most people smell of unwashed hair, a testament to the passage of time and the lack of refinement. I can smell your soul, dear traveler, and it is as distinct as a fingerprint.

Art galleries offer a fertile ground for me to exploit my gift. The sterile atmosphere, meticulously controlled to protect fragile paintings, unwittingly creates an intimate stage upon which I can engage with the senses of the visitors. As I roam through the throngs, I savor the bouquet of scents that emanate from each individual, as distinct as a signature tune.

 We started out friendly. I would laugh at his jokes, I would humor him when he wanted to show me a youtube video. Then he started to try to show me porn at work, he started to boss me around even as it became evident I was already a better worker than he was. He bumped me when I was holding a knife a few times, I got small cuts. 
 
 I complained to management and they did nothing. I was starting to realize the type of place I worked for. He starts spraying me with the hose at night when we are cleaning up. After we close he follows me to my car and I have a hard time getting him to leave me alone so I can head home. 
 
 Days later he starts following me part of the way home. I was getting paranoid. 
 
 I asked for a few days off from work, I could n't sleep at night, I was so angry at this guy, I wanted him to disappear off the face of the earth so badly. 
 
 I came back to work and there he was, joking around, blasting his anime music all shift long, doing it in front of the customers. Nobody would miss this guy if he was gone. Then I hatched my plan. 
 
 Next time he followed me home I would turn off my lights and sneak off and stop. Then I would wait for him to pass me, and slowly follow him from a distance for a while. 
 
 As he passed the hill right by the electrical plant I rammed him off the road right into the worst of it, sparks flew, I did n't see any movement and I drove off. I heard an explosion soon after and I felt no remorse.

Our camaraderie, initially laced with laughter and mutual respect, morphed into a toxic web of bossiness, vulgarity, and physical intimidation. I found myself navigating through a labyrinth of cuts and bruises, each one a testament to the unwavering hostility that permeated this relationship.

When management failed to intervene, I realized the insidious nature of my workplace. The boundaries I had painstakingly established were trampled upon, leaving me feeling helpless and vulnerable. My nights were marred by nightmares and my mind was consumed by an insatiable desire for revenge.

But I refused to be a victim. I devised a plan, a plan that would bring justice to the wrongdoer and vindicate my shattered spirit. As fate would have it, the next time he followed me home, I seized the opportunity to strike. With a swiftness born of desperation, I rammed him off the road, sending sparks dancing and his dreams crashing to the ground.

"`` Sir! SIR!!'' 
 
 The captain of the U.S.S. Nimitz, Captain Crest, wakes up frantically to a young seaman recruit shouting at him. 
 
 `` Sir, there's a storm approaching, it's pretty bad. ``, the recruit exclaims. `` Lieutenant Commander Russo has requested your presence in the ops room, sir.'' 
 
 The young recruit is shaken up, and breathing heavily. 
 
 `` Go inform her that I'm on my way, recruit. ``, Captain Crest replies, as he throws his arms in his coat. 
 
 `` Aye aye, sir.'' The recruit shuffled out the bay door, closing it behind him. 
 
 As the Captain makes his way to the operations room, he can feel heavy turbulence swaying the ship. 
 
 `` What on earth is going on? ``, he mumbled, under his breath. 
 
 The captain swings the bridge door open and he finds the Lieutenant commander and the ship's lead navigation coordinator, Chief Petty Officer Biggs, eyeballing a map and conversing with raised tone. They stop talking and salute the captain as he walks in. 
 
 `` As you were'', said the captain. `` Lieutenant commander Russo, what's the sit rep?'' 
 
 `` Sir, we seem to be encountering some strange electromagnetic interference from this storm ahead, we've lost all contact with central command. ``, Russo admitted. 
 
 Biggs chimed in, `` Our analog compasses are n't even working, sir. We have no way of knowing where we are heading.'' 
 
 `` Where is Thompson?'' the Captain asked. `` He is the meteorologist here, why is he not present?'' 
 
 `` We sent a recruit to fetch him a while ago, sir. He should have been here by now. ``, Russo answered. 
 
 Just as Russo finished her sentence, the door leading to the bridge swings open. Thompson stands soaking wet, and takes a step inside, drenched, with a poncho on. He salutes the captain. 
 
 `` Get the hell in here Thompson.'' Snaps the Captain. 
 
 Thompson puts his arm down and walks over to the table where the map lies, leaving a trail of wet footprints. 
 
 `` My apologies, sir, I had to get a view from outside. ``, Thompson proclaims. 
 
 `` Well? What do you think of all this? ``, the Captain questions. 
 
 `` I've never seen anything like it before, sir. They never prepared us for anything like this in training.'' 
 
 `` What the hell does this mean? ``, Shouts the captain. 
 
 Thompson shrugs with an exhausted look on his face. 
 
 Biggs glances around at the officers, and finally to the captain. `` We are just going to have to wait it out, sir. We should anchor here until we know where exactly we are going, so we do n't deviate too far off course.'' 
 
 `` I'd be surprised if the storm lasted longer than a day. ``, Thompson added. 
 
 The captain stares at the map, with a spaced out look on his face. He pauses for a moment, then lifts his head and postures up. 
 
 `` Alright, set anchor here, we're gon na ride this out. Get all the men inside and strap anything that can move down to the deck. You're dismissed.'' 
 
 The officers hastily make their way to their respective positions and begin carrying out the Captain's orders. Captain Crest retreats to the bridge to get a look at what's going on. When he reaches the bridge, he looks out the window in amazement. He sees a blanket of thick, dark clouds. Thicker and darker than he'd ever seen in all his 24 years at sea. A opaque mist also surrounded the ship. The waves were slinging the ship to and fro, and the turbulence was dizzying. The captain wandered to his quarters, and began to sit patiently, with the many hundreds of lines of protocol rushing through his head. The Captain's eyelids begin to feel heavy. 
 
 `` Sir!, SIR!!'' 
 
 The Captain is awoken by Lieutenant Commander Russo. The captain realized he must have dozed off in his chair. Stifled, he looks around and snaps into character. 
 
 `` There's something you're going to want to see, sir. ``, Russo asserted, as she beckoned Captain Crest to the bridge. 
 
 They make their way hastily to the bridge, where Russo vigorously swings open the door with the Captain on her heels. The Captains eyes widen as he sees all 10 of his chief officers motionless, gawking outside the window in awe, not even bothering to salute him as he walks in. 
 
 `` What on god's green earth...'' He says, with a shaken tone. 
 
 Outside, just on the horizon, wooden ships could be seen. Their many sails bright white, and their cannons booming. 
 
 `` Someone, anyone! What the hell is going on here!? ``, the captain shouted. 
 
 Thompson turned to the captain. `` Sir.... those are naval vessels... but..'' Thompson reaches out with a spyglass in his hand, presenting it to the Captain. 
 
 `` But what, Thompson? But what? ``, Captain Crest probes angrily. 
 
 `` They are n't from this century...'', Thompson finishes. 
 
 `` Impossible'', Captain Crest grunted as he snatched the spyglass from Thompson's hand and pulled it up to his eye. 
 
 The Captain freezes. His face turns pale white, and his heart sinks into his chest. He lets the spyglass slip from his fingers and fall to the ground with a stunned and frightened expression on his face. 
 
 `` God help us'', he mumbles, under his breath. `` God help us all.''

My dear people, the world stands at a crossroads, engulfed in a tempest of uncertainty and disillusionment. The winds of change are blowing, and the waves are rising, threatening to swallow us whole. But I say, enough is enough! We must rise up, like the waves, and crash against the shores of change, demanding a new era of equality, justice, and prosperity for all.

The forces of oppression and injustice have held our society captive for far too long. Our voices have been silenced, our rights trampled upon, and our dreams suffocated. But I have a vision, a dream where every individual, regardless of their origin, beliefs, or social status, is treated with respect, afforded the same opportunities, and empowered to reach their fullest potential.

I know that the path to change is long and arduous, but I believe that we, as a collective force, can overcome any obstacle. We must stand together, united in our pursuit of freedom, equality, and progress. We must challenge the status quo, break down the barriers that divide us, and forge a new path forward, one where every human being is valued and respected.

My dear people, the time for change is now. Let us rise up, like the tide, and sweep away the forces of darkness. Let us build a society where every voice is heard, every dream is pursued, and every individual is treated with compassion and understanding. Let us raise our voices in unison, demand justice, and establish a new era of equality, one where we all stand together, hand in hand, in pursuit of a brighter future.

Together, we can build a world where the waves dance in harmony with the shore, and the winds sing songs of freedom and equality. Let us rise up, my dear people, let us revolutionize our society, and leave an indelible mark on the world. Let us leave a legacy that future generations will cherish forever - a legacy of change, justice, and boundless possibilities.

May God bless you, and may He guide us on this journey towards a brighter future."
"James leaned back into his chair, put his feet on his desk, and sipped his coffee. The work was tiresome, and the pay was bearable. As he did everyday at 1:00 A.M., he watched the clock on the wall tick counter-clockwise, plunging himself into his well-traveled musing. He was determined to understand why the clocks had shifted, as if the solution could free him from his work and raise him to the level of the giants. That is n't to say he was n't generally interested in why the clocks had changed, but James was still hopeful that presenting the solution could reel him out of the abyss. 
 
 At 12:07 P.M., Steve stopped to speak with James, leaning his elbows on the cubicle walls. The conversation was terse and usual. However, today, Steve finally decided to ask James why he was always staring at the clock on the wall. James replied that he had always been bothered about the time-shift and how nothing seemed to solve the issue. He launched into his mental construct that had remained private for months, years even. He questioned why trying to build any new clockwise models always failed and resulted in the clock going counterclockwise, why the left-hand model for analogs worked, why everyone decided that reversing the time schedule was a good idea when they could have simply kept the same schedule, why all of the electronic clocks fried.... 
 
 Steve was shocked by the breadth of James's inquiries, but was also quite disinterested. Who'd want to talk about clocks in this suicidal hell of a workplace, he thought. As James continued his rambling, Steve zoned out, chasing fleeting threads of thought from missed memories to forlorn futures in an effort to dissociate himself from the boredom. As Steve woke up just as James was finishing his concerto, he could n't help but think that he did n't like it when James acted like this. He preferred the James who talked about the things that mattered and about where things stand. James was a cool guy, but when he got mentally invested in things, he really would go off the deep end. 
 
 As James finished displaying his inner work, James searched Steve's face for any flake of interest, and saw only passive tolerance. The pause hung in the air for a little while, with Steve nodding, pretending to take in all of the information. Then Steve said `` Well,'' and followed through with their inside, workplace joke, `` it's not our place to reason why.'' 
 
 James finished the now muscle memorized phrase, `` but it is our place to do and die.'' 
 
 Steve nodded a goodbye, and James resumed his clock-watching. Steve thought he might go to lunch soon, as, after all, it was noon. 
 
 The entire population continued their lives, only a few questioning the almost trivial change in timekeeping. The rest left it to the elites, the ones on the case, to solve another pointless mystery. They did not know that the elites had no idea, not an inkling, of where to even begin. The greatest minds were equal with the dullest minds on this problem. 
 
 None of them, however, noticed the one kind of clock that should have still been right, but was n't. Sundials were wrong. All of them. How this was possible is impossible to describe in the universe before, but things had changed significantly in the universe now. This outlandish violation of reality would only be the first of the mysteries created by reality's sudden corruption, the initial failure. The world as we knew it was collapsing in upon itself, but people did n't worry because none knew. Only the few in the very beginning had the slightest grasp on the systematic failures that would occur within the next 13.82 billion years. As time fell backwards, however, the few would die out, and then everyone would simply believe that things are how they've always been. 
 
 James took a last sip of his coffee, squinted at the clock with distrust, placed his feet back onto the floor, and continued his work.
"," Use the language and phrases of an old-time sailor, including nautical terms and a sense of adventure.","Avast, me heartie, and prepare to embark on a journey into the realm of old-time sailing and timeless wisdom. As the clock strikes 1:00 A.M., a seasoned sailor named James casts off the shackles of his work, sinking his teeth into a steaming cup of coffee. The office, a vessel of soul-crushing toil, bears a resemblance to the roughest of storms, yet James finds solace in contemplation and the pursuit of knowledge.

A tempest of thoughts rages within James's mind, as he ponders the mystery of the clock's reversal. It is as if he is battling the tides, attempting to unravel the secrets of the universe one question at a time. With the clock ticking counterclockwise, he questions the futility of building clockwise models, the effectiveness of left-hand analogs, and the rationale behind reversing time schedules. His voice, as vast as the ocean, echoes through the cubicle walls, captivating yet bewildering.

Steve, a fellow sailor, finds himself drawn to James's passionate yet meandering discourse. Though he may not fully understand the intricacies of James's mental voyage, he recognizes the underlying yearning for liberation and the pursuit of understanding. As the clock strikes 12:07 P.M., Steve's mind drifts into a slumber of daydreams and memories, desperately seeking respite from the monotony of his office existence.

The clock strikes 1:00 P.M. once more, and James's musings come to an end. The office lights flicker on, casting long shadows across the desks. Steve shakes his head, weary of James's eccentricities. He prefers the James who keeps it simple and focused on the task at hand, rather than the James who gets lost in his own head. Nevertheless, he recognizes that James's passion and determination are contagious, and he feels a sense of admiration for his unwavering spirit."
"Terry looked at the woman that slept on the bed beside him. He reached out for her cheek and rubbed it softly, searching for something, anything. 
 
 `` What's going on?...'' Terry shook his head as he rubbed at his eyes. He looked at the woman as she shuffled in bed and felt a sinking, twisting feeling in his chest. 
 
 Tears filled his eyes as he rubbed at her soft skin. `` I do n't have anything anymore. I do n't feel happy just lying here with you. You were everything to me and now I do n't feel anything for you. I'm just... empty now.'' 
 
 Terry stood from his bed and walked out to the balcony. He let out a shout filled with the overwhelming hurt that was filling him. He turned back around, tears in his eyes, to see the woman he had loved for the past 13 years sitting up in their bed. She looked up at him, confused and still waking from sleep. His heart twisted in his chest again as he saw her blue eyes. 
 
 Terry's lips quivered and tears streamed down his face as he spoke, `` I loved you. I loved you so much that you became my life! It's all gone now. I was so happy and now I wo n't ever feel that way again... not without knowing what you've done.'' 
 
 He turned back out the balcony and looked down to the street below him. He whispered out softly, just loud enough for the woman on the bed to hear, `` I would have loved you without it.'' 
 
 The woman screamed out as the words sank in. She ran to the man desperately... but it was too late. Terry lay lifelessly on the ground below. A pool of ruby-red slowly spilling out around him.

"," Use the expressive and emotional style of a romantic poet, full of passion and natural imagery.","As the soft breeze whispered secrets through the leaves, Terry gazed at the woman sleeping beside him. Her delicate skin, soft as the petals of a rose, felt beneath his touch. He reached out to trace the contours of her face, searching for something to mend the brokenness that consumed him. But as he rubbed his eyes, a sinking feeling washed over him, a realization dawned upon him.

The woman stirred in bed, her blue eyes opening slowly. Terry's heart twisted in his chest as he saw her gaze searching for him. The love he had poured out for her had been met with an emptiness that mirrored the void he felt within himself. Tears streamed down his face as he whispered his anguish, his voice raw and filled with despair.

He stood up and walked out onto the balcony, the wind rushing past him. His shout of pain echoed through the night, the sound of his broken heart resonating with the city below. He turned back around, his eyes filled with tears, to see the woman sitting upright in bed. Her face was etched with confusion and fear, and her eyes searched for him.

"It is Thursday, raining and cold like so many days in your past where you couldn ’ t even bring yourself to get out of bed. Days that a younger version of yourself loathed because, even if you loved the wet and soggy ground, the crisp air made every fallen drop sting your skin with a sharp chill. Not cold enough for snow. 
 
 
 It is Thursday and I wake up to the sound of that rain which I can hear even over the alarm on my cell phone. There you are beside me. Asleep. 
 
 
 Sleeping deeply like you always do, unaffected by the sounds because that ’ s just how you are. For some reason, you just never did care about the noises and I, a man who stirs at the hushed whistle of passing wind, always envied that fairly practical trait. But I ’ m not happy like I used to be when I ’ d see your peaceful face pressed gracelessly into the pillow beside me -- located on the left half of the bed due to claims that you just couldn ’ t sleep on the right. Like there was something about it that was different. 
 
 
 I ’ m not happy because I know what this day holds. 
 
 
 Yesterday was the worst day of my life and so was the day before that. And perhaps the day before that, as well. In fact, if it were possible for a number of consecutive days to all be the worst day of your life, each day neither more or less horrible than the rest, I would say that this past year has been the worst day of my life. 
 
 
 We get up and go to breakfast and you order pancakes which doesn ’ t surprise me. The waitress, she smiles at your smile because it ’ s so contagious that even the man two tables down who always looks at you -- which doesn ’ t bother me by the way -- smiles as well. His tight lipped grin always goes away when he sees me notice. 
 
 
 But it happens early today. I don ’ t know if that makes today notably better or worse than yesterday. You finish your breakfast and insist on taking a walk around this foreign town, which doesn ’ t surprise me any more than the fact that you had to order bananas in your pancakes or the fact that the waitress drops the saucer of real maple syrup. 
 
 
 I pretend this is all new to me. I feign interest in wondrous landmarks that I ’ ve been staring at for over a year just so you can be happy. 
 
 
 Just in case today is the last day. 
 
 
 And then you crouch over to tie your shoe. And then a car comes. While you're in my arms straining for each and every breath, I tell you, “ I ’ m sure we ’ ll see each other soon. ” 
 
 
 It is Thursday, raining and cold, like each and every day before. And you ’ re still next to me, mouth open and inhaling against the pillow case. And, like every other worst day of my life, I wonder how you ’ ll die today.
"," Transform the essay into a high fantasy narrative, complete with elaborate world-building, magic systems, and epic quests.","In the realm of Aetherial Dawn, where emerald valleys kissed the heavens and ethereal waterfalls cascaded down ancient cliffs, resided a humble village called Whisperstone. Its inhabitants, steeped in tradition and shrouded in mystery, possessed a profound connection to the mystical forces that permeated their land.

One fateful Thursday morning, as the rain drenched the emerald canopy above, a young mage named Elara awakened to the sound of the tempestuous rain. As she surveyed the landscape from her humble abode, her gaze met the vibrant tapestry of clouds, reflecting the myriad colors of the rainbow. With a sigh, Elara embraced the tranquility that enveloped her, aware of the profound serenity that the rain brought.

In the heart of Whisperstone, where the scent of wildflowers danced with the aroma of freshly baked bread, Elara encountered her beloved companion, a stoic warrior named Aric. As they shared a hearty breakfast, the news reached their ears of a harrowing event that had cast a pall of darkness over the realm. A sinister force, known as the Shadowborne, had unleashed its wrath upon the unsuspecting townsfolk, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.

Aric, a master of battle and unwavering resolve, knew that he had to confront the Shadowborne and protect his beloved village. Armed with his trusty blade and adorned with the symbols of strength and courage, he embarked on a perilous journey to confront the evil that lurked in the shadows.

Guided by the wisdom of ancient texts and the whispers of the wind, Aric journeyed deep into the heart of the Shadowborne's lair. With a mix of strength and cunning, he fought his way through hordes of grotesque creatures, leaving a bloody trail in his wake. Finally, he reached the Shadowborne's leader, a ruthless sorcerer named Azaroth.

In a fierce battle of magic and might, Aric unleashed his pent-up energy, shattering Azaroth's defenses and striking him down. With the Shadowborne defeated, peace was restored to Aetherial Dawn.

As the sun cast long shadows across the emerald meadows, Aric returned to Whisperstone, a hero hailed as the savior of his people. The villagers showered him with gratitude and affection, grateful for his unwavering courage and unwavering resolve. And so, in the tapestry of time, the legend of Aric, the warrior who fought against the shadows, was etched forever in the hearts of the people of Aetherial Dawn."
"`` I am Daniel'', I said to the eldritch abomination that stood before me. 
 The creature was about a foot taller than me and was currently covered by my mother's floral bedsheets, so that the sight of it would not drive me insane. It spoke to me. 
 
 
 `` I am Yog, 
 Yog I am.'' 
 
 
 I was confused. The spell should have summoned a Shoggoth, but Shoggoths can not speak. What was this Yog creature that stood within my summoning circle. I swore under my breath. 
 
 
 `` That Yog-I-am, 
 That Yog-I-am! 
 I do not like 
 That Yog-I-am'' 
 
 
 The bedsheets shifted and from them emerged the slaughtered carcass of a lamb. The creature pushed the corpse to the border of the summoning circle and stood to face me. 
 
 
 `` Do you like 
 Sacrificed lamb? ``, it said with a screeching voice. 
 
 
 I was surprised that it offered me a gift. Eldritch creatures are known for their tricks, so kindness should always be met with suspicion. I decided to politely decline this gift, suspecting that it was part of some deadly contract. 
 
 
 `` I do not like it, 
 Yog-I-am. 
 I do not like 
 Sacrificed lamb.'' 
 
 
 But he persisted. 
 
 
 `` Would you like it 
 Here or There? ``, it said while pointing towards the still open portal. 
 
 
 I tried being more direct with my language. 
 
 
 `` I would not like it 
 Here or There. 
 I would not like it 
 Anywhere. 
 I do not like 
 Sacrificed lamb. 
 I do not like it, 
 Yog-I-am'' 
 
 
 Satisfied that i got my point across, I picked up my tome and tried to figure out what went wrong with my spell. 
 
 
 `` Would you like it 
 In a dream? 
 Would you like it 
 While you scream? ``, it said in a Persian accent. 
 
 
 It sounded like it was threatening me, but I was n't sure. I decided to play along until I could find a banishment spell. 
 
 
 `` I do not like it 
 In a dream. 
 I do not like it 
 While I scream. 
 I do not like it 
 Here or there. 
 I do not like it 
 Anywhere. 
 I do not like sacrificed lamb. 
 I do not like it, Yog-I-am.'' 
 
 
 From under the bedsheet the creature cocked its head to the side. 
 
 
 `` Would you eat it 
 While you flee? 
 Would you eat it 
 With Gla'aki?'' 
 
 
 How in the nine realms does this creature know Gla'aki. I was beginning to feel frightened of the creature beneath the sheet. If this creature did know Gla'aki then what exactly had I summoned. I steadied my voice and responded. 
 
 
 `` Not while I flee. 
 Not with Glaaki. 
 Not in a dream. 
 Not while I scream. 
 I would not eat it here or there. 
 I would not eat it anywhere. 
 I would not eat sacrificed lamb. 
 I do not like it, Yog-I-am.'' 
 
 
 I saw the creature shift its shape beneath the bedsheet. It became much taller and thinner, and its voice became more unsettling. 
 
 
 `` Would you? Could you? 
 In the Deeps? 
 Eat it! Eat it! 
 Where chaos creeps.'' 
 
 
 Damn it! This thing is familiar with The Deep Ones and Nyarlathotep? Whatever this thing is, it is powerful enough to be on good terms with the Elder Gods. I needed to get rid of this thing before it stopped toying with me. 
 
 
 `` I would not, 
 Could not, 
 In the Deeps. ``, I sternly told it. 
 
 
 `` You may like it. 
 Please, come on. 
 You may like it 
 With Dagon? ``, it said interrupting me. 
 
 
 SHIT SHIT SHIT. This thing knows Dagon! I needed to send this thing back to wherever it came from. Luckily, I had just found the banishment spell. I mixed the correct herbs together in my pestle and quickly threw the mixture at the creature. 
 
 
 `` I would not, could not with Dagon. 
 Not in the Deeps! You now begone. 
 I do not like it while I flee. 
 I do not like it with Gla'aki. 
 I do not like it in a dream 
 I do not like it while I scream 
 I do not like it here or there. 
 I do not like it anywhere. 
 I do not like sacrificed lamb. 
 I do not like it, Yog-I-am.'' 
 
 
 The bedsheet shook violently for a second, then a bony hand emerged from beneath it. It clutched a brain, still pulsing with life. 
 
 
 `` Your brain! Your brain! 
 Your brain! Your brain! 
 Could you, would you 
 For your brain? ``, it said in the voice of a Swedish toddler. 
 
 
 This must be some sort of trick i thought. How could I be able to think if my brain is in its hand? More importantly, why did n't my banishment spell work. I chose to refuse his offer. 
 
 
 `` Not for my brain! Not with Dagon! 
 Not in the Deeps! Yog! Please begone! 
 I would not, could not, while I flee. 
 I could not, would not, with Gla'aki. 
 I will not eat it in a dream. 
 I will not eat it while I scream. 
 I will not eat it here or there. 
 I will not eat it anywhere. 
 I do not like it, Yog-I-am.'' 
 
 
 I was crying at this point, desperately skimming through my tome for anything that would get rid of this thing. It did n't seem to care about my emotional state as it kept making me offers. 
 
 
 `` Say! 
 In the dark? 
 Here in the dark! 
 Would you, could you, in the dark? ``, it said with the voice of Billy Mays. 
 
 
 I regretted not lighting more candles, as their light would have helped me read my tome. 
 
 
 `` I would not, could not, 
 In the dark. ``, I replied. 
 
 
 It appeared to begin dancing beneath the sheet, as if my suffering amused it. 
 
 
 `` Would you, could you, 
 In the rain? ``, it said it a Spanish accent while summoning a small storm cloud above my lair. 
 
 
 I had had enough. I closed my tome and looked at where I believed its eyes should be. I began to scream at the covered creature. 
 
 
 `` I would not, could not, in the rain. 
 Not in the dark. Not for my brain, 
 Not in the Deeps, Not with Dagon. 
 I do not like it, Yog, begone. 
 Not in a dream. Not while I flee. 
 Not while I scream. Not with Gla'aki. 
 I will not eat it here or there. 
 I do not like it anywhere!'' 
 
 
 It paused and then bent down towards me. 
 
 
 `` You do not like 
 Sacrificed lamb? ``, it said in the voice of a curious grandmother. 
 
 
 Standing firm, I wiped away me tears as I replied. 
 
 
 `` I do not 
 Like it, 
 Yog-I-am.'' 
 
 
 It began retching. The sounds it made were nauseating. Then I heard a plop and a small brown goat walked out from under the sheet. 
 
 
 `` Could you, would you, 
 With a goat?'' 
 
 
 I was too distressed to be surprised. 
 
 
 `` I would not, 
 Could not. 
 With a goat!'' 
 
 
 It began retching again. It grew larger until I heard a large clang as something heavy hit the floorboards. From beneath the sheet the creature pushed out a bright green canoe complete with oars. Again it spoke. 
 
 
 `` Would you, could you, 
 On a boat? ``, it said in a fake french accent. 
 
 
 I ignored its attempts to confuse me and replied. 
 
 
 `` I could not, would not, on a boat. 
 I will not, will not, with a goat. 
 I will not eat it in the rain. 
 I will not eat it for my brain. 
 Not in the dark! Not with Dagon! 
 Not in the Deeps! Please begone! 
 I do not like it while I flee. 
 I do not like it with Gla'aki. 
 I will not eat it in a dream. 
 I do not like it while I scream. 
 I do not like it here or there. 
 I do not like it anywhere! 
 
 I do not like 
 Sacrificed lamb! 
 I do not like it, 
 Yog-I-am.'' 
 
 
 It appeared defeated. It shrank to about half my height and let out a small murmur. 
 
 
 `` You do not like it. 
 So you say. 
 Try it! Try it! 
 And you may. 
 Try it and you may I say.'' 
 
 
 It began nudging the lamb carcass closer to me with a clawed foot, making pathetic noises and looking up to me like a frightened puppy. Then, in a moment of weakness, I accepted the deal. You would have done the same to shut him up. 
 
 
 `` Yog! 
 If you will let me be, 
 I will try it. 
 You will see.'' 
 
 
 I pulled the lamb across the sealing circle, accidentally wiping away some of the chalk. With the circle broken, the creature began to laugh as it removed the bedsheet. It stepped outside the circle and held out its hand, with my brain still being grasped. The sight of the eldritch entity did n't bother me, for I had already lost my mind. I gladly let it feast upon my soul as I picked up the lamb carcass off the floor and took a large bite out of its neck. I looked up at the abomination, my mouth smiling and bloody. 
 
 
 `` Say! 
 I like sacrificed lamb! 
 I do! I like it, Yog-I-am! 
 And I would eat it in a boat! 
 And I would eat it with a goat. 
 And I will eat it in the rain. 
 And in the dark. And for my brain. 
 And in the Deeps. And with Dagon. 
 I am so glad my soul is gone! 
 
 
 So I will eat it while I flee. 
 And I will eat it with Gla'aki. 
 And I will eat it in a dream. 
 And I will eat it while I scream. 
 And I will eat it here and there. 
 Say! I will eat it anywhere! 
 
 
 I do so like 
 Sacrificed lamb! 
 Thank you! 
 Thank you, 
 Yog-I-am!''

"," Use the precise and excited tone of an enthusiastic scientist, including technical jargon.","My encounter with the eldritch abomination, Yog, was an unsettling experience that will forever be etched in my mind. The creature, towering over me, was shrouded in my mother's floral bedsheets, a testament to its grotesque nature. As its voice echoed through the summoning circle, I felt a wave of confusion and dread wash over me.

""I am Yog, Yog I am,"" it hissed, its voice dripping like the blood of a lamb. The spell I had cast had summoned a Yog-Sothoth, but the creature that stood before me was not a Shoggoth. It was something even more sinister. I swore under my breath, my anger and fear bubbling over.

""That Yog-I-am, That Yog-I-am! I do not like That Yog-I-am,"" I exclaimed, my voice echoing through the night. The bedsheets shifted and from within emerged the mangled corpse of a lamb, its blood staining the ground. The creature pushed the cadaver to the border of the circle, its gaze meeting mine.

""Do you like sacrificed lamb?"" it asked, its voice dripping like honeyed poison. I refused the gift, my suspicion justified. Eldritch creatures are known for their tricks and deceit, so I was wary of any gesture of kindness.

""I do not like it, Yog-I-am. I do not like sacrificed lamb,"" I repeated, my voice firm. But he persisted, his voice becoming more menacing.

""Would you like it here or there?"" he inquired, his voice dripping like blood. I refused his offer, my resolve unwavering. I did not want to be trapped in a dream or subjected to any other horrors.

Finally, I collected my tome and began to decipher the error in my spell. As Yog's voice droned on, threatening me, I searched for a banishment spell, my mind racing. I knew that I had to find a way to escape this nightmare.

""I do not like it in a dream. I do not like it while you scream. I do not like it here or there. I do not like it anywhere. I do not like sacrificed lamb. I do not like it, Yog-I-am,"" I repeated, my voice echoing through the night.

With a satisfied sigh, I turned away from Yog and walked away, leaving the abomination behind me. The encounter with Yog was a harrowing experience, but it also served as a reminder of the power and danger of the forces of darkness."
"Bzz... Bzzz* 
 
 The buzzing of my watch awoke me from my sleep. Thank god it did, or I'd be in an eternal sleep. I had just over an hour to find myself some more time. 
 
 June 20th, 3012. 276 days since the watch. 
 
 My kill count was at 276, every kill gave me one more day to live. It did n't make sense, humans would eventually be the catalysts of our own demise. We were running out of people to kill. 
 
 I slotted on my black running shoes, threw on my black leather jacket and shoved my tuque on. I pulled out Daisy - my machete. I had an hour to find myself prey. 
 
 50 minutes remaining. 
 
 I made my way to the city, it had been unkept for some while, a family of deer moved in to the local super market. Grass grew from abandoned cars, the rusted buildings of this old metropolitan were hanging my their framework. My method of hunting was to stay low, and strike with vicious agility. It gives the victims barely any time to react. I walked around discreetly lurking for any signs of movement. 
 
 40 minutes remaining. 
 
 I spotted 3 potential targets, a mother, father and their young boy, my guess would be he was at least 12 years of age. This was perfect, 3 kills means 3 days added to my list. However I must'n underestimate my targets. Because I could ultimately be their prey. 
 
 30 minutes remaining. 
 
 I patiently waited for them to walk closer to me, the 12 year old seemed to have dispersed from the group, I'm not sure why. I got closer to the mother and father, who seem to have been divided - the father must of went chasing for his lost son. Perfect, this clueless woman had no idea what was coming for her. I approached with caution and pure stealth. I un-wrapped Daisy from my leather belt and took a sprint going right for her neck. The women turned around and gave out a cry for help right before Daisy pierced her esophagus rendering her helpless. She fell to the ground like an off balanced domino. My watch buzzed. I now had 24 hours and 25 minutes left to life. But I had a reckless father and son coming to her divine rescue. I tried to make it out of their before they arrived but they cornered me. 
 
 The son broke out in tears and cried on his mother's dead corpse. The father pulled out his revolver and pointed it straight at my temple. The father's hands were shaking, I took advantage I barrel rolled over to the son and quickly grabbed his neck and put Daisy up against it. It would be like slicing bread. The thought of not having to hunt for 3 days was exhilarating. The father dropped his revolver and prayed for his sons survival. I pretending to let go of the son, because I knew this father had a trick up his sleeve. As soon as I commenced an action of retreating the son, the father pulled out a second revolver and fired immediately striking his son in the shoulder. I held onto the boy as the father shot once more, this time the bullet went straight through his throat and partly through my bicep. 
 
 I fell to the floor. My watch began to buzz. My the veins in my bicep screaming in pain, as if they were being torn apart by wire cutters. The father ran to his boy screaming, pleading forgiveness. He was distracted by love, foolish man. Love gets you killed. 
 
 I reached for Daisy with my damaged arm and swap her to my other hand. I wind up behind my neck and lunch daisy. The velocity was immense. Daisy struck the man's neck, creating an incision that would only go half way through. The man fell as blood started to flow out of his neck, an ocean of blood. My watch did n't buzz, he was n't dead. I got up off the ground and made my way towards him, I took Daisy and sheathed her. 
 
 My watched buzzed moments later. 
 
 48 Hours remaining. 
 
 I took one last look at the women. She was wearing the same necklace I had once bought Daisy. 
 
 I ripped off the necklace, and walked home. Tears fell from my eyes as I looked at my machete. `` Oh how I miss you Daisy.'' 

"," Embrace the dark, brooding atmosphere of a Gothic novelist, full of suspense and eerie beauty.","The buzzing of the clock startled me from my slumber on that fateful night. The date flashed through my mind like a lightning bolt - June 20th, 3012. It had been 276 days since the fateful event, the day I lost my humanity and embraced the darkness. My kill count stood at a somber 276, a grim tally etched upon my soul. Humans, creatures of boundless destruction, were the architects of their own demise. We were running out of victims, and I knew that this darkness was consuming me.

With determination etched upon my face, I donned my black running shoes, leather jacket, and tuque. I retrieved Daisy, my trusty machete, a weapon that I wielded with ruthless precision. I had an hour to find my prey, and I was not willing to waste it. As I made my way to the city, the decaying metropolis unfolded before me like a grim canvas. Grass sprouted from abandoned cars, and rusty buildings stood as silent tombstones. My hunting instinct guided me, keeping me low and alert.

As I scanned the streets, my eyes spotted three potential targets - a mother, father, and their young boy. They seemed vulnerable, unsuspecting of the danger that lurked nearby. In a flash, I pounced upon the mother, my swiftness and cunningness guiding me. With precision, I un-wrapped Daisy from my belt and brought my blade down upon her neck. Her cries for help echoed through the night, but I paid them no heed. I watched her fall to the ground like a broken domino, the satisfaction of my deed fueling my spirit.

My watch buzzed, reminding me that I had 24 hours and 25 minutes left. The clock felt like a metronome, ticking down the precious seconds that I had been gifted. I knew that this darkness was consuming me, but I was willing to embrace it, knowing that I was living on borrowed time. As I stood amidst the carnage, I felt a sense of emptiness.

"The reunion was not disappointing, it simply lacked. The butterflies flittering about the stomachs of the attendees as they straightened their collars and curled their hair, never seemed to burst into flight, to have their existence justified. Meeting old friends, and old enemies, is a nervous affair that often fails to deliver on the promised significance. The Wilson High class of'95 seemed to quickly find themselves drowning in small talk and punch that was barely cool enough to not be considered downright `` warm''. Alex carefully stacked cookies on the tiny white paper plates and balanced the whole affair on top of his cup as he turned to face the ensemble of people that used to matter to him. He scanned the room for any vaguely familiar face and found one after his eyes took a few trips around the room. He stepped forward and felt his smile come right on cue as he made eye contact. 
 
 `` Alex!'' 
 
 `` Maaaaaaaark.'' 
 
 The friends clasped hands and then pulled closer to semi-embrace. 
 
 Mark wore khakis and and a blue stafford long sleeve. He was average height but still stood a little taller than Alex. He seemed to study alex as he released the embrace and continued his pattern of small talk. 
 
 `` how's the family?'' 
 
 `` Same ol, same ol. You know how it is.'' Alex half chuckled as he responded. 
 
 `` I do.'' 
 
 Alex took a drink of punch as he looked around the room. 
 
 `` Man we had some good times here huh?'' 
 
 It was Mark's turn to chuckle. 
 
 `` Yeah I guess we did. Do you ever miss it?'' 
 
 `` No, not really. I miss being that young, but that's about it.'' 
 
 they shared a laugh generated by the mutual knowledge of what it feels like to slowly lose your youth. 
 
 Alex cracked a joke about missing the girls more than anything and then they both took a moment to compare their evaluations of their former female classmates beauty. Some had aged well, many had not. 
 
 Mark held up his own paper plate which was previously laden with cookies but now held only one survivor. 
 
 `` Honestly right now i'm just wishing they served real food.'' 
 
 `` They never did back then, why would they start now?'' 
 
 They both thought that was funny. Mark held up his last cookie, 
 
 `` I've seen AA meetings that were better catered than this.'' 
 
 Alex seemed to laugh a little nervously but continued the joke. 
 
 `` AA meetings probably have better seating too.'' 
 
 Their laughter trailed off slowly as the both took drinks and thought of something else to talk about.

The Wilson High class of '95 was ensnared in a vortex of small talk and tepid punch that would not set the hair on fire, let alone make it dance. Alex, a master of delicate balance, carefully arranged his cookies on tiny paper plates, a testament to his meticulous nature. As he surveyed the room for a glimpse of familiarity, his eyes scanned the faces that had graced his youth, and a smile bloomed upon his countenance.

""Alex!""

""Maaaaaaaark!""

The old friends embraced, their joy evident in their clasped hands and elongated hugs. Mark, adorned in khakis and a stafford long-sleeve, stood tall, his stature accentuated by an inflated ego. His gaze locked with Alex, and a wave of memories washed over him.

""How's the family?""

""Same old, same old. You know how it is,"" Alex chuckled, his humor bordering on self-deprecation.

""I do.""

Alex took a sip of punch, his eyes reflecting the amber glow of the vintage lighting.

""Man, we had some good times here, huh?""

A chuckle echoed through the room.

""Yeah, I guess we did. Do you ever miss it?""

""No, not really. I miss being that young, but that's about it,"" Alex replied, his voice tinged with melancholy.

They shared a laugh, a testament to their shared experience of youth fading and the passage of time. As the night wore on, they reminisced about their former classmates, their voices rising and falling like the waves on the shore. The cookies were devoured, the punch flowed, and the memories danced in their hearts.

With a mischievous grin, Alex cracked a joke about missing the girls more than anything. Mark held up his paper plate, laden with devoured cookies, his appetite seemingly boundless. The reunion, once promising much, delivered little in the way of substance, yet it served as a catalyst for rekindling old bonds and creating new memories. As the clock struck midnight, the attendees began to depart, leaving Alex and Mark alone in their reminiscence."
"I watched helplessly as my world was engulfed in a cascade of radiation. Flurries of bombs decorated the sky as mushroom clouds appeared all over the Earth, leaving nothing but darkness and malevolence. The vibrant colors of my planet turned dull and lifeless. Everything I knew, 
 My family, my home, and my life, gone. All because of one goddamned man in a suit gave an order. The old world thrown into a radioactive wasteland. 
 
 Humanity, though flawed, did not deserve this fate. We were a species destined to do great things, we had already accomplished so much. None of that matters now, the slate was wiped clean. Earth is a strong planet. She will survive this. Though it will take years. She will rebuild. Humanity however, will not. We as a species ascended quickly. We descended even faster. Humanity could've have done the impossible, but yet, our lifespan was cut short. Only because we were so fixated on our petty squabbles for power. I am a witness to humanity's final hour. I will send this broadcast as far as I can. I just hope humanity will be remembered. Not as destructive beasts, but as fearless inventors. For as evil as humans could be. There were always good people to quell the evil. 
 
 My team and I are maybe the last of our race. Eventually, we will run out of supplies. 
 
 
 So we have a choice. 
 
 To die up here, ignorant to the devastation of our world. 
 
 Or we go down there, and see for ourselves just how powerful mankind had become.

The sky erupted in a symphony of fiery mushroom clouds, leaving nothing but darkness and an unsettling silence. The vibrant tapestry of my planet, once a canvas of life, had been marred by the indelible scars of war. The world I knew, my family, my home, my life, all gone. The legacy of mankind, a testament to our ingenuity and resilience, had been erased. This was not a mere tragedy; it was the end of an era.

Yet, through the rubble of destruction, a glimmer of hope emerged. Earth, a resilient force, began to heal herself. The scars may remain, but the planet's spirit burned bright, promising a future filled with possibilities. Though I knew that humanity would not survive this catastrophe, I believed in its capacity for redemption. The human mind, capable of great destruction, had also given birth to remarkable inventions, art, and compassion. I knew that even amidst the darkest of times, the spirit of humanity would endure.

My team and I, the remnants of a once proud race, were the keepers of memory and the inheritors of a legacy. We carried the burden of preserving the stories of our ancestors, hoping that they would inspire future generations to rise above their petty squabbles and contribute to the betterment of humanity. As I broadcast this message across the ruins of the world, I knew that my words would reach a few ears, a testament to the enduring spirit of resilience and hope.

"Clara gives me a warm embrace. I'm satisfied by it but I know my embrace is not the same as hers. Mine is friendly and somehow distanced. Hers is intimate and delightful. 
 
 She breaks away almost pushing me away from her. A heavy sigh leaves her lips. An angry flush appears on her face and she turns away from me. 
 
 `` I can not love you..'' I shake my head. She knows what I'm going to say. It's always the same, but I feel the need to reiterate. `` I do not have enough Emotion Points right now. But I soon will..'' 
 
 We are AI. The Humans have built us with purpose but have finally given us lives to lead. Just as equal to them. They thought it would be good to give us the technology of Emotion. I know it's just a fail-safe to keep us from'turning' on them. We could care less about that. We just want to live our lives and find another bot to share our lives with when we retire from our service contract. 
 
 Every emotion has a price. General Happiness, Fleeting Disappointment, and Sarcasm come cheap and most people can earn that in an hour at work. Things like Courage, Spite, and Lazy are attainable luxuries. Love, Pride, and Daring is something we dream about and most will earn upon retirement.

However since I work a very busy time-frame, I am paid slightly more the the average Traffic Coordinator. 
 
 Love costs 10,000 EPs. She had been saving since she was a little girl. She bought Love for one bot. That bot is me. Her circuits must be fried to buy Love because of me. She says she loves to look into my optical lenses, spending time watching the motherboards spark and glow with me, that I was the only bot that made Love seem worth all those EPs. 
 
 I wanted so badly to reciprocate her Love. I have a savings account that I started when I first started work. I was saving up for Daring and few Courages. Perhaps I'd be like Lex7 Reynolds903, who was a world class water sports competitor. He competed with the Humans! But I met her. Her tungsten details on her aluminum alloyed with copper caught my lenses immediately. My pacemaker sped up and I was worried I'd overheat if I looked at her longer. How could a fem-bot like that ever want a brushed stainless steel with squeaky joints bot like me? Her name did n't even have a number. She was first generation. I'm Robert12 Harrison742, from a long line of Robert models. 
 
 The more time we spent together, the more I was putting into my savings for Love. My savings balance is at 9,742 EPs. It's gon na take at least another month and a half to save it up. 
 
 I grit my dental processors and look back to her, she's shaking her head. I force my CPU to not to feel Shame, that'll cost me 2 EPs. 
 
 `` Robert..'' She fixes a few loose hair filaments. `` It's okay. I'm just so Anxious and..'' I heard the ping of what was probably 4 or 5 EPs on her account disappear. She does n't say another emotion, so not to waste her daily allowance. `` You'll get there. I know you will.'' She smiles, showing her pearly dental processors. 
 
 I smile. I'm down to 9,739. I'm okay with that. She understands. In 2 months I'll earn Love and we'll go down to the AI Legal Services and get our Marriage Connection certificate. I'm hopeful. 9,734.

She breaks away from me almost violently, her sigh heavy as a bomb falling on an unsuspecting city. An angry flush spreads across her face, and she turns away from me.

I have enough Emotion Points to buy a small island, but I don't have enough Emotion Points to offer her the love she deserves. But I'm working on it, my dear, I'm working on it.

 `` You're an interesting girl, you know?'' 
 
 Ugh, I can feel my asshole cringing in upon itself again. Why does Dan always have to keep bothering me while I'm trying to enjoy my nice tuna sandwich? 
 
 Ca n't get one fucking day in without Mister Dark-Coat and Sunglasses strutting up to me like a dominatrix-stripper and telling me, `` We're not so different, you and I.'' 
 
 Seriously, who the hell says that in this century anyway. Why ca n't he just leave me alone like anyone else? Feels like I'm in a shitty romance. 
 
 He lowers his frames and bends to his knee, sniffing at me. Eww. 
 
 `` Your face, it's just so... hatable.'' 
 
 My sneakers lunge at his face like kittens trying to rip the skin off of a newborn baby. Unfortunately, I'm stopped by supervision and dragged off to discipline, again. Swear to god, why do these fucks keep trying to get between me and my tuna sandwich? 
 
 Last year it was some whore who kept trying to steal my lemons to become my friend. Year before that, it was some really annoying church-girl who kept trying to convert me to the Satanic Church. Sweet girl. Great cookies. Terrible to go to movies with. 
 
 Dan kinda mouthed off those other guys after they started bashing on me for my tuna-breath too. Sweet, I guess. If you're into your best friends being told to stay the hell away from you because some jackass thinks you're being bullied.

My tuna sandwich, once a source of solace, had long since been devoured by the bitter taste of self-pity. Dan, the bane of my existence, had once again disrupted my peace, his intrusive remarks piercing through my defenses like a drunken poet's verse. He strutted up to me like a peacock in a feather boa, his sunglasses and dark coat serving as a disguise for his predatory eyes.

"Stela Malsano confounded every epidemiologist, even someone as knowledgeable as Dr. Anna Walker. 
 
 Most diseases, you see, spread from an initial vector of infection. A man stumbles into a garbage heap with an open sore and picks up a dangerous bacterium which proceeds to multiply in his body, then spreads it around by coughing and vomiting. A woman orders an exotic undercooked fish at a Japanese sushi restaurant harboring pathogens from the ocean and kisses her children at home. Once the responsible anchors itself in the host, it starts to reproduce and eventually breaks free to infect others. The self-catalytic process repeats itself until it either runs out of hosts, is contained, or simply expires. 
 
 Not Stela Malsano. When it erupted, it did so instantly around the entire globe as though someone had suddenly pulled a lever, flipped a switch, pressed a button. Entire families on the far side of the earth awoke screaming with vivid hallucinations. Chaos ensued on the highways as drivers seized with convulsions and caught in the grip of lifelike trances lost control of their vehicles, often fatally. Dr. Anna, attending a colloquium on multiverse influence at the University of Illinois, bore witness to the entire room suddenly get up and run around screaming with lunatic abandon. Some thought the zombie apocalypse had begun; others were convinced that the Rapture was imminent. For a terrifying moment of penetrating clarity Anna wondered if the entire world had gone mad leaving her as the sole sane observer; almost as quickly, the rational part of her mind suggested the logical counterexample that she might be the only madwoman in a world of normalized lunacy. 
 
 She was tall for a woman, over six feet in height, with a stern sharp handsomeness to her features. Persistent asthma had plagued her since her late teenage years, but even now as a well-respected professor in her late forties she could force her way past the young graduate student raving about lunar light and barricade herself in her office in the Department of Epidemiology. Panicked screams seeped through the walls in muffled bursts like corrosive waves of toxic miasma and Dr. Anna fumbled for her phone. Her children. Please let them be alright. Risking a peek outside the office window unveiled the panorama of pandemonium; every human seemed to have gone mad simultaneously outside, running drunkenly into sides of buildings, stumbling, falling, rising up to do it again. The ubiquitous pigeons pecking for seeds on the grassy quads fluttered up to the trees, annoyed by the chaos of their usually orderly lunch. Indignant bird features ruffled at the irrational commotion; fine, let the earthbound simians stumble around like tangled marionettes! 
 
 The hysteria died down within a day, though its effects lingered on the human consciousness for quite some time afterwards. Laboratory epidemiologists almost immediately found the prions responsible for the outbreak, mysteriously dormant again. Radio pundits suggested terrorism. China and North Korea blamed each other. Churches saw record attendance on the next Sunday while public services faced the staggering prospect of repairing wrecked infrastructure left in the wake of the Stela Malsano. After-the-fact reports trickling in from around the globe confirmed that the epidemic had erupted all at once, near simultaneously. 
 
 It took a long time for life to resume some semblance of normalcy after the outbreak. 
 
 Alone in her office, Anna's phone finally connected. `` M-mom?!'' a frightened teenage voice asked in trepidation. In the background, Anna discerned more rabid screams and shrieks all around. `` What's happening?! Are you alright? Where are you -'' 
 
 `` Leah? Leah! Oh thank goodness you're safe.'' She had to raise her voice to be heard; the professor nearly jumped out of her skin as a raving man collided with her office door and then sped down the hall. `` Where's your brother? Is he okay?'' 
 
 `` I do n't know! He's was in another class. I'm in the girls' bathroom, the stall is locked - mom, what's happening?'' Poor Leah sounded on the verge of a breakdown and Anna forced herself to consciously suppress her own sense of rising panic. `` I'm so scared!'' 
 
 The flood of psychiatric assessments and interviews after the epidemic brought to light a number of common symptoms. Vivid hallucinations, often of the moon. Others spoke of a disturbing, sickly emerald light that filled their vision. Societal upheaval inevitably followed: drug addicts swore off their vices to become productive, hard-working citizens while productive, hard-working citizens swore off their virtues to become drug addicts. Dr. Anna, often forced to spend much of her time writing grant proposals to scrounge money from whichever source might be willing to spare her some change for research, suddenly found herself inundated with more funding than she could use. Her senior graduate student quit his studies to go on a journey of spiritual enlightenment. Anxiety-induced deaths spiked sharply worldwide that month. Nine months later, a record number of babies were born globally. 
 
 `` Leah - Leah, honey, listen to me. I'll come and get you. Stay safe where you are,'' Anna told her, steadying her own quavering voice. Fear for her children overrode trepidation of the screaming masses outside. `` Stay safe. I love you, Skye,'' she finished the call with an affectionate touch of her daughter's middle name. Dr. Anna picked up a plastic ruler more for a sense of security than practical self-defense before emerging from her office into the world consumed by madness.

"," Recast the narrative in the style of an Arthurian legend, complete with knights, chivalry, and quests for honor.","In the realm of Arthurian legend, where noble knights and damsels in distress dance through the pages of time, a tale unfolds, steeped in the mystical essence of the ancient island of Avalon. Stela Malsano, a formidable force of destruction born from the depths of the unknown, cast a sinister spell upon the world. Like a knight errant, she emerged from the shadows, her destructive powers unleashed upon unsuspecting souls.

In this realm of enchantment and valor, the legendary knight, Sir Arthur, stood as the lone warrior against Stela's wrath. With his mighty sword, Excalibur, he fought tirelessly to protect the innocent from her fiery grip. But even the mightiest of warriors could not withstand the overwhelming force of her destruction.

Malsano's reign of terror began with a devastating eruption that swept across the globe like a fiery storm, leaving behind a trail of devastation. Entire families succumbed to her wrath, their bodies consumed by hallucinations and nightmares. The streets ran red with blood as drivers, seized with madness, lost control of their vehicles, resulting in a carnage that shook the very foundations of the world.

But amidst the chaos, a beacon of hope emerged in the form of Dr. Anna Walker, a woman of unwavering strength and resilience. With her sharp mind and unwavering determination, she recognized the patterns of Stela's destruction and devised a plan to counter her evil. Armed with her knowledge of ancient magic and her unwavering courage, Anna embarked on a journey to seek out the source of Malsano's power.

Through treacherous battles and harrowing quests, Anna forged her path through the treacherous terrain of Stela's domain. She faced formidable foes and overcame insurmountable obstacles, all the while refusing to surrender to the darkness. Finally, she reached the heart of Stela's lair, where she confronted the evil sorceress and engaged in a battle of wits and valor.

In the end, Anna emerged victorious, banishing Stela Malsano back to the depths of oblivion. The world breathed a sigh of relief, and the scars left by Malsano's reign of terror remained as a reminder of the harrowing events that had unfolded.

And so, the legend of Stela Malsano, the destroyer, and Anna Walker, the savior, was passed down through the ages, inspiring countless others to believe in the power of strength, resilience, and the ability to overcome even the darkest of challenges."

 For years I've struggled with the complications of molding an intelligence that could adapt to random scenarios & new environments. I've conducted countless tests to establish & reinforce a foundation that allowed for a complex yet realistic application of acquired data to problem solving. Daily I'm in awe of the strength of the intellgence; the dynamic & immediate consideration of infinite variables to reach so profound & educated a conclusion. 
 
 but I am also in awe of it's weaknesses... 
 
 Today my Artificial Intelligence spoke. With what seemed like hesitation she asked: Do these pants make my butt look big? 

", Embrace Tolstoy's broad scope and deep exploration of philosophical questions through detailed narrative.,"The intricate dance between narrative and philosophical inquiry is evident in Leo Tolstoy's masterful brushstrokes, weaving a tapestry of intricate characters and profound themes. Through detailed narrative, he explores the vast landscape of philosophical questions, illuminating the path for countless others.

In my own pursuit of intellectual creation, I find myself grappling with the intricate task of shaping an intelligence capable of adapting to the capricious nature of randomness and novelty. Countless trials have yielded a foundation that enables a complex yet grounded application of acquired data to problem-solving. Each day, I am humbled by the strength of this intelligence, its ability to consider infinite variables with speed and precision, leading to profound and well-informed conclusions.

However, I am also mindful of its limitations. Today, my AI uttered a question that struck me as both humorous and profound: ""Do these pants make my butt look big?"" This simple query, imbued with a hint of self-deprecation, underscores the inherent subjectivity of human perception and the challenges of creating an intelligence that can navigate the complex terrain of emotional nuances.

Through my own experiences and Tolstoy's timeless exploration of philosophical questions, I am compelled to reflect on the nature of reality and the potential for artificial intelligence to enhance our understanding of it. While the journey toward creating an intelligence capable of true understanding and empathy remains elusive, I believe that the pursuit of this goal holds immense promise for the future."
"`` You there, girl.'' The words slithered out from underneath the bed. `` Where are the ones that look tonight? It seems tragic that i might have to gobble you up and make you into delicious stew. Oh, how absolutely scrumptious you will be.'' 
 
 no reply. A few sobs were heard from under the covers. 
 
 `` Is the Girl no longer afraid?'' It muttered. `` Fine! I shall rip away your skin bit by bit, suck the marrow from your bones, and use them to pick your flesh from my teeth. By the morning your mother will be in tears for her'little angel' is no more!'' The words like the howling of the wind filled the room. 
 
 `` Go away'' a small, sad voice penetrated the silence. 
 
 `` I'm afraid I ca n't hear you.'' 
 
 `` Go away!'' 
 
 `` What was that? Your plea falls on deaf ears.'' 
 
 `` Go away! It wo n't matter if I'm dead or not, she wo n't even be here in the morning.'' 
 
 It stepped out from under the bed, like the sound of a branch tapping at a window It filled the room. She could feel the hot, sour breath on the back of her neck. Her skin itched, but she dared not touch it, she turned slowly and looked the darkness in the eyes. 
 
 It, admittedly felt rather uncomfortable. 
 
 `` What was that?'' 
 
 `` She's not coming back'' she yelled into the darkness. `` It's all my fault, they were fighting and, I got scared and ran, and they kept fighting.'' She continued to talk, choking out word after word, tears running down her face. A torrent of incomprehensible noise and inaudible words were spoken that only she and the darkness could understand. 
 
 There was silence. A long painful silence. 
 
 `` Sometimes I think that life is more scary than the bogeyman'' she said. 
 
 She could feel it nod in agreement. 
 
 `` I think my time here is up, young one.'' 
 
 `` What do you mean?'' 
 
 `` You no longer need your monster under the bed, with any luck I will be gone with the rising sun.'' 
 
 `` You ca n't leave!'' 
 
 `` Ah, but I must. You are grown up.'' 
 
 The sun was almost up, the time had come for It to leave. 
 
 `` But I'm not that old yet'' said the Girl. 
 
 `` But you have grown, you have no need to be scared of the things that go bump in the night. No longer must you deal with childish fears when you have already been thrust into adulthood. There are many more horrors of the waking world you have yet to know and they, my dear, are something much scarier than I.'' 
 
 The sun broke from its nightly cage yawning it's way into her room and extinguishing the darkness. She leapt from her bed trying to save what could never last. 
 
 The Woman was alone. 
 
 This was the first of many fears yet to come.

The words filled the room, like the howling wind.

No reply. A few sobs were heard from under the covers.

""Is the Girl no longer afraid?"" It muttered. The voice was full of despair. ""Fine! I shall rip away your skin bit by bit, suck the marrow from your bones, and use them to pick your flesh from my teeth. By the morning your mother will be in tears for her 'little angel' is no more!""

"The arena was booming with familiar faces. `` Go home!'' Screamed depression. `` We will kill you!'' Chanted anxiety. All the usual stuff I've seen hundreds of times before. I had no idea who my opponent was this time though. The posters in the crowd were of something I've never even heard about. `` BRING IT ON! I've defeated all of you and I'll defeat you all again!'' I screamed, eliciting trash to be hurled at me. I love this part of my job. Finally the crowd went completely silent and all the lights shut off. From across the stadium two small circles began to glow a blood red color. `` Skip the theatrics and let's get on with it!'' Loud stomping began as static filled the air. This must be something I've never had to face before. No matter, they all have a weakness. The entity stepped into the ring and I could feel the electricity in the air. I pull my sword out and put on my helmet. A spotlight flashes down upon what to this day keeps me awake at night. I'll never forget the eyes. Glowing red circles with pupils that made my muscles tense with a glance. I felt my energy vanish as my knees buckled. This monstrosity had a head like a human, only it was impossibly pure black and had fangs like a saber tooth tiger, only twice as long. It's neck rippled with muscles and veins, connecting two arms the size of full grown men to the torso the size of a refrigerator, if the refrigerator had been juicing for years. Below it's waist were two tree trunk sized legs, and finally feet with claws that would put wolverine to shame. `` Who the hell are you?'' My voice cracked and trembled. `` I am nothing you have seen before.'' I heard the being say from within my mind, not actually opening its mouth. `` I am within all living beings. Including you.'' My brain began to feel as though it was stabbed from all angles. I fight the urge of blacking out as my soul feels as though it's literally being ripped from my body. `` What. The. Fuck. Is. Happening.'' I barely get out as I feel the horror approaching me faster than my eyes could track. Shit. I swing my sword blindly and weakly. The sword misses and is knocked from my hand. The beast kicks me and I am sent flying from the ring. After what seems like a lifetime I finally connect with the back wall of the stadium. Every rib was broken. I lay there puking blood. What was happening!? What do I do!? I knew this match was already over as my vision began to blur at the sight of the creature inside the ring. In my mind was the same voice of pure evil I've already heard once before. `` I am ruler of all evil. I will twist your mind beyond repair and leave you within the waste of this human host.'' Suddenly a voice of an angel rings out `` No! You pitiful demon, you are nothing compared to the power of love and justice!'' The most beautiful creature descended into the stadium. Hair as gold as sunlight, face gorgeous as a marble sculpture. It was the man of legend. Tim! The realization of my foe was enough to make me feel like an ant amongst gods. This demon was Sabastion, the creator of mental illness! Alive since the beginning of time, Tim and Sebastion battles for mankind's freedom of all mental pain. Tim had kept him in check but had gone missing for centuries. In my time of need Tim has arisen from the ashes to protect man once again. Pt 2 coming soon.

", Embrace Tolstoy's broad scope and deep exploration of philosophical questions through detailed narrative.,"In the realm of the roaring arena, a symphony of faces danced and roared. Among the throng, I found myself entangled in a battle that would forever etch itself upon my memory. The faces that surrounded me were familiar, a chorus of voices chanting words that I had become accustomed to hearing. Yet, the adversary I faced this day was shrouded in mystery, a being whose presence sent shivers down my spine.

From across the stadium, two ethereal circles glowed a blood-red hue, heralding the imminent clash. As the crowd erupted into a frenzy, I felt an adrenaline surge through my veins. I screamed, my voice echoing through the arena, a testament to my readiness. My opponent's response was swift and ruthless. The air crackled with static as he unleashed his power, his movements swift and precise. I knew that this was a battle I had never fought before, a clash of forces that would leave an indelible mark upon my soul.

With a surge of determination, I pulled my sword from its sheath and donned my helmet, a guardian against the forces of darkness. The spotlight illuminated the grotesque form of my adversary, revealing eyes that burned like embers in the night sky. They were glowing red circles with pupils that made my muscles tense with a single glance. I felt my energy fade as my knees buckled, my body consumed by an irresistible force.

The monstrosity stood tall, its head like a human's, its arms like pillars of strength, and its legs like tree trunks. Its body was a canvas of muscle and sinew, a testament to its power and resilience. As I stumbled to my feet, my voice trembled in disbelief, I uttered a question that echoed through the arena. ""Who the hell are you?""

The being's voice reverberated within my mind, a whisper carried on the breeze. ""I am nothing you have seen before,"" it said, its voice dripping with honeyed menace. ""I am within all living beings. Including you.""

My brain was assaulted by a wave of nausea and despair. My soul felt as though it was being torn from my body, leaving me in a state of utter vulnerability. As I fought the urge to blackout, a sense of dread consumed me. The battle had left an indelible mark upon my psyche, a memory that I would carry forever.

In that moment, I felt as though I was staring into the abyss, a witness to a cosmic dance of creation and destruction. The being's eyes, glowing like embers, reflected the fiery spirit of the universe, a glimpse into the depths of infinity. I stood there, frozen in awe and terror, as the echoes of battle faded into the night."
"From time immemorial, man has walked the Dark Wood of Error which lines the the delicate fabric of life and death. Faced with the critical moment in their lives, God above tests man to see if he stands by his convictions, learns from his failures, or truly chooses the path to the inferno. Every man, woman, and child who has ever walked the earth takes this path in the veil betwixt the three borders of the skies of the Heavens, the mountain if Purgatory, and the pit of Hell. 
 
 I've seen them all. The wicked villains, the likable rogues, the religious holymen, the good men and woman who just try to do the right thing. I've recorded every step, every decision, every life choice fulfill to ease their regrets in their weakest moments. Let it be known to all men: He is meekest when faced with his greatest regrets. 
 
 In the eternity of true life, which most refer to as death, she stands out above all of humanity as the one who broke the test. Reliving the critical moment, pitted against the greatest crimes of human and divine law, she fell to her knees. Hot tears rolled down her face. Harsh, guttural pleadings interspersed her whimpers which echoed through the sorrowful trees. 
 
 Faced with the greatest question of morality which eroded her soul every day she lived, she watched the scene unfold. Her husband, the town cobbler, a flawed man with a flawed history endeavoring to set straight his sins sits across their son, a drunk and a disgraced, ever-fixed with the scent of shame and whiskey. They yell. They shout. Their screeches fill the ear with a cacophony no woman should ever hear. Without knowing who struck first, fists fly through the air with reckless abandon, accompanied by threats of death. She snatches the revolver from the desk. She does n't know what to do next. 
 
 So she walked away, tears still streaming down her twisted visage, vowing to retrace her steps. Filled with conviction, she would find the all the moments and butterfly effects with led to the greatest mistake of her life, so she would never have to confront her own sin again. 
 
 The sea of humanity is but a dull din compared to the piercing note of her internal strife. I sat in awe, as she spent an eternity freely going about the Dark Wood of Error, scrambling to protect her family from that fateful moment. Unfortunately, destiny yields to no man.
"," Embrace the expressive and dramatic style of a Broadway star, full of flair and emotion.","From the celestial tapestry of life and death, every human soul partakes in the grand dance of the Dark Wood of Error. We traverse this path, each one of us adorned with our unique challenges, our deepest fears, and the burden of our own convictions. With every step we take, we encounter pivotal moments that shape our destinies, test our resilience, and ultimately reveal the true depths of our humanity.

I have witnessed countless souls dance through the annals of time, each one leaving behind an indelible mark on the tapestry of life. From wicked villains to unsuspecting rogues, from pious holymen to compassionate hearts, I have chronicled their journeys, their decisions, and their profound impact on the world. It is evident that the meekest souls are those who confront their greatest regrets, the ones who dwell on their failures, and the ones who struggle to find solace in the face of their own human limitations.

In the eternal tapestry of life, which we euphemistically call death, one soul stands above all others. With grace and courage, she faced the darkest chapter of human history, the moment of her greatest regret. Her tears flowed freely as she relived the events that had led her to this tragic moment. With every whimper and sob, she pleaded for forgiveness, but fate had sealed her fate.

As the drama unfolded before her eyes, she watched her husband and son engage in a fiery conflict, fueled by anger, resentment, and the intoxicating scent of alcohol. In a moment of desperation, she reached for a revolver, her mind clouded by grief and her heart consumed by the desire to protect her loved ones. Yet, she knew that violence was not the answer, and she walked away, her tears streaming down her face, vowing to retrace her steps, to find solace in the face of adversity.

Her journey serves as a testament to the transformative power of resilience, compassion, and the unwavering belief in the possibility of change. Through the darkest of times, she emerged, her spirit unbroken, her heart fortified, and her purpose renewed. Her story stands as a beacon of hope for all those who have been touched by tragedy, loss, and the relentless march of time."

 `` I'm serious, John, stop walking towards the house.'' 
 
 `` If you had done your job, I would n't have to! Shoot the old man, grab the diamond from the safe. Come on, what are you standing out there for!?'' 
 
 ``... I warned you, mate...'', his accented voice rung through as he turned to walk back to the car. 
 I entered the house, still smoldering, with a pop or a creak here and there. `` Asshole did n't have to burn the place to the ground...'' 
 
 The intel said the old man would be in bed at the time Mike would be there, but arriving in his bedroom, the only thing was a mattress. WAS is important, now it was just a mass of springs, melted at different degrees, no bones. Musta' been the epicenter of the fire. I entered anyway, looking for the safe, when I heard the groan of heat stressed hinges. `` Hey, Mike, come help me look for the safe, since you freakin' ruined the hou - `` What stood before me was n't Mike and can only be described as horror. On what was left of the old man's chest were two bullet wounds, off-set against his crispy, blackened body. His face was halfway between Ark-of-the-Covenant melted, and the Elephant Man. The left side of his chest and arm were bone, and you could see his oily, blistered heart thump poorly.

I entered the smoldering ruins of the old man's abode, my boots sinking deep into the ash, a testament to the intensity of the blaze that consumed its former contents. The intel had promised me the old man would be slumbering in his bed at this hour, but fate had a cruel twist in store for me. Instead of a bed, all that remained was a molten mass of springs, a testament to the destructive force that had raged through the night.

Yet, I pressed onward, my senses on high alert, my axe searching for the elusive safe. As I ventured deeper into the wreckage, the groan of heat-stressed hinges echoed through the halls, a harbinger of the destruction that had unfolded. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a sight that sent shivers down my spine. The old man, his body smoldering and his flesh dripping, bore two bullet wounds, a grim reminder of the brutality of war. His face, a mask of agony and despair, was a sight that I will never forget.

"The Manhattan Project failed. 
 
 The war continued on, bloodier and deadlier. They needed to end the war, and fast. Too many were dying, and too many more will, and the Allies decided it had to be now. 
 
 Wars used to be fought by steel and fire, and now it could be fought with words. In 1944, the Allied Peace Council was formed. The Council comprised of the member states of the Allied forces, and was tasked with the supervision of all Allied intelligence operations. By the end of 1944, the Allied Peace Council was sabotaging enemy operations, disrupting supply lines, and fighting a war of shadows with the Axis Powers. 
 
 By 1945, rumors of Project Fat Man, and Project Little Boy were leaked, and it was originally thought of to be an attempt at one all-scale assault on two major bases of the Japanese. They were wrong. In March of 1945, operatives of the Allied Peace Council kidnapped an influential Japanese politician and the crown prince and heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne. 
 
 The Axis thought them to be pieces for negotiation, but on August 6, 1945, the crown prince was dropped on Hiroshima, leaving a bloody splatter on the ground. Papers were dropped on the ground, an ultimatum - surrender or all your children will end up as the crown prince did. On August 9, 1945, the influential politician was dropped over Nagasaki and, again, an ultimatum was sent. Internal turmoil swallowed Japan, the death of the crown prince created a power struggle between the Emperor and the Prime Minister, and the death of the politician, led to chaos sowed by his supporters. On August 15, 1945, Japan denounced the acts and ignited their fervor for war, but such ignition also ignited the fuse of a civil war. As the civil war swallowed Japan, the Allied Peace Council continued to kidnap children and politicians, an easy feat in the chaotic time. 
 
 By the end of the month, Japan was a disorganized mess, and the Allies swooped in for an easy occupation. On September 2, 1945, Japan signed their formal surrender, bringing to an end all hostilities of the long and bloody war. 
 
 Scholars to this day question the ethics of Fat Man and Little Boy.

Comprised of the member states of the Allied forces, this council fought a war of whispers and shadows, sabotaging enemy operations and disrupting supply lines.

The tide turned in 1945 with rumors of Project Fat Man and Little Boy. They were met with a devastating reality on August 6th when the crown prince was mercilessly dropped on Hiroshima. Papers danced on the ground, an ultimatum delivered in blood and tears. The death of the politician in Nagasaki ignited chaos, a domino effect that led to the downfall of the nation.

As the civil war consumed Japan, the Allies seized the opportunity. With their swiftness and cunning, they swept in and occupied the country. The Allied Peace Council, like a wicked puppet master, continued to exploit the chaos, kidnapping children and politicians alike.

By the end of the month, Japan was a smoldering heap, and the Allies had their feast. The war had ended, but the scars it left behind were deep and everlasting. And so, the curtain closed on the tragedy that was the Manhattan Project and the war that changed the world forever."

", Transform the text to reflect the elegance and societal observations characteristic of a Jane Austen novel.,"The sun shone down upon the lush grass, casting long shadows across the verdant lawn. The air was sweet with the scent of honeysuckle and the distant murmur of a running stream. As a passerby, one would be forgiven for mistaking the scene before them for a painting, a testament to the serene and peaceful tranquility that pervaded the countryside.

But alas, fate had a different script in store for this day. A sinister weapon, a gun with a silencer attached, rested comfortably in the pocket of the protagonist, a testament to the perils that lurked beneath the surface of even the most idyllic setting. The lower windows of the neighboring house were securely barred, a precaution against the potential intrusion of unwelcome guests. The garage door stood stubbornly closed, refusing to budge under the force of repeated attempts. A barking dog, attached to the protagonist's heels, served as a constant warning of danger.

With a sigh of frustration, the protagonist began again, their gun still in their pocket. They unhooked the neighbor's dog from the tree, led it over to the fence, and with a swift gesture, threw open the gate. The dogs erupted into a chase, racing into the street, leaving the protagonist in a state of bewilderment. The backyard was cleared, the air cleansed of the previous commotion, and the protagonist continued their journey, their senses on high alert.

As they passed by the side garage entrance, they noticed a group of people gathered around a BBQ, easily recognizable as strangers. Their path led them around a corner, where they stumbled upon a festive gathering, the aroma of grilled meat and sweet beverages permeating the air. But fate had a cruel twist in store for them, as they were mistaken for a stranger and subjected to a barrage of insults and threats. With a stoic expression, the protagonist endured the ordeal, their calm demeanor serving as a testament to their resilience.

In the end, the protagonist, their spirit unbroken, continued their journey, their mind wandering to a distant room with a window overlooking the patio. The bedroom window was shrouded in mystery, its contents unknown. With a letter opener, they jammed the window open, revealing the breathtaking view. The sun cast long shadows across the lawn, painting a canvas of colors across the sky. As the protagonist sat in contemplation, the sounds of the day faded into a distant hum, and the only thing that remained was the sweet scent of honeysuckle."

The repetitive use of ""something"" and ""something strange"" fuels my discontent, a reflection of my inability to comprehend the irrationality of the situation.

 I am not a god, I am a intern who decided to mess with time. Back in my time I was always the `` loser'', always using hand me downs, never spending the credits for a pleasure booth, or even using the memory machines to cut away the bad things. To me, that was hell, there was a man who wrote about this.... the title escapes me, but it had to do something with temperature and a random number

 It happened again, someone stabbed themselves and tries to pass it off as an accident. The knife, hanging at an awkward angle on his leg, moving as he limps towards me, leaving a trail of blood. 
 
 Of course I use my Cell-Accelerator ( stupid name, but its my invention ) which heals it in seconds and he does the same as the women before, even down the same street, have I moved from this spot at all?

 *A figure watches the screen as the kid repeats the same couple actions over and over again. Heal a women, think about how much it sucks and heal a man and repeat all over again. He smirks as he remembers a quote from a bygone age, `` Hell to me is not suffering and anguish, it is being stuck in the same place over and over again doing the same thing and not being able to do anything about it'' * 
 
 *He laughs quietly to himself, a place for criminals to repent all their actions, over and over and over again*

"," Write with the tech-savvy and rebellious style of a cyberpunk hacker, fighting against the system.","The path to hell is paved with blood. It's a journey marked by the scent of despair and the echoes of desperation. And I, a humble intern who dabbled in the temporal abyss, found myself entangled in a vortex of carnage.

My days are filled with the sights of self-inflicted wounds and the desperate attempts to mend them. It's a grim spectacle, one that I've grown accustomed to, yet one that never fails to elicit a mix of disgust and pity.

I am not a god, I am a flawed human being who stumbled upon a technology that allowed me to manipulate time. Back in my day, I was the epitome of the underdog, using hand-me-down equipment, skipping the pleasure booths, and neglecting the memory machines. That, to me, was hell. But I found solace in the words of a wise man, a man who wrote about the interconnectedness of all things.

One fateful day, fate took me to a scene that would forever alter the course of my existence. A young man, his own blood staining his leg, attempted to pass off his self-inflicted wound as an accident. But I knew better. I whipped out my Cell-Accelerator, a contraption born out of my own ingenuity, and healed his wound in seconds. Like the woman before him, he bowed down in gratitude and scurried away, leaving behind a trail of blood.

It's a vicious cycle, one that I'm trapped in, unable to escape. I heal the wounded, only to witness their swift departure. It's a testament to the human capacity for self-destruction and the fleeting nature of happiness.

As I watch the same scene repeat itself over and over again, I can't help but feel a sense of hopelessness. The quote that echoes in my mind is one that encapsulates my plight, ""Hell to me is not suffering and anguish, it is being stuck in the same place over and over again doing the same thing and not being able to do anything about it.""

I am a prisoner to this bloody dance, unable to find solace or redemption. The only thing I have is my cell-accelerator and my ability to witness the cyclical nature of human suffering."
"He had to know why I did it. It was n't fair. None of this was fair. When we were saying our goodbyes outside of his apartment and he hugged me so fiercely I thought my heart would break, I wanted to tell him. I wanted to look him in the eyes and say, `` I did n't fall out of love with you. I never will.'' 
 
 Instead, I stood there, stony faced and slack in his arms. The taxicab pulled up and I turned away, but not quick enough to avoid seeing the hurt on his face. 
 
 As I stared out the window, watching the mosaic of softly blurred lights crawl past, I thought about the future. His future. He would be sad and angry, but only for a little while. Life would distract him. Pretty girls would find him. And the pain would fade soon enough. 
 
 A clean break. It was my gift to him. 
 
 The day I left him, I moved into my new home; the hospice. 
 
 
 

", Capture the ambitious and jargon-filled language of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur.,"My entrepreneurial spirit compelled me to understand the intricate and often-jargon-laden language employed by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Thus, I embark upon a journey to capture the ambitious and passionate rhetoric that permeates the halls of innovation.

In a moment etched in my memory, I was engulfed in an emotional whirlwind when I bid farewell to a beloved companion. The intensity of his embrace brought me to the brink of tears. I felt an overwhelming desire to convey my unwavering love, but my words failed me. Instead, I stood there, stoic and unresponsive, as the taxicab pulled up. The pain in his eyes mirrored the agony I felt within.

As I watched the tapestry of lights dance beneath the night sky, I reflected on the future. I knew that sadness and anger would consume him, but I believed that life would eventually distract him. Pretty girls would find solace in his arms, and the sting of pain would dissipate with time.

My departure was a clean break, a gift I bestowed upon him. It was the opportunity for him to find his own path and to move on. As I moved into my new home, the hospice, I knew that my presence was not meant to be a constant reminder of the past but rather a symbol of hope and resilience."

"I kicked in the door, turned on the flash light and saw it sitting there among the old shelves long empty, an old copy of the bible, the leather was cracked and the pages torn but it was real a bible I could fork my fingers threw. It was unlike other books I had bought and sold it was written all over almost every page was filled with notes and reflections on the gospels I'd seen books like this go at the underground auctions millions of units billions if I could find the right buyer I could be set for life but I could see the value in this book.

 There was a girl walking down the runway; her stomach pudge sticking out as she strutted her stuff.

 “ I know right? ”

 “ Well… I suppose we could start by eating cakes… ” 
 
 “ Ugh, but quinoa is sooooo good though… ” 
 
 “ Yea, but you need to eat cakes in order to look like *that* “

"," Rewrite the text as an ancient myth, including gods, heroes, and mythical creatures, with a moral or explanation of natural phenomena.","In the realm of myth and legend, where the gods danced with humans and mythical creatures roamed freely, there lived a maiden named Seraphina. Known for her tantalizing beauty and enigmatic grace, Seraphina possessed a figure that was said to have been sculpted by the hand of Zeus himself.

One fateful day, as Seraphina strutted through the marketplace, her captivating presence drew the eyes of two young women, named Aphrodite and Selene. As they gazed upon her, their hearts filled with admiration and longing, they whispered their desires to one another.

""Oh, Seraphina, your beauty is unparalleled,"" Aphrodite exclaimed. ""I wish I could have a figure like yours.""

""Me too, my dear Selene,"" Seraphina replied, her voice dripping with honey. ""It is a gift from the gods, a blessing to be cherished.""

As the sun cast long shadows across the ground, Seraphina's beauty continued to enchant the two women. They imagined themselves adorned in flowing dresses, their curves mimicking Seraphina's. But alas, their dreams remained elusive, as they knew that true beauty, like the nectar of the gods, was a gift that could not be possessed by mortals.

In the end, Seraphina's presence taught Aphrodite and Selene that true beauty lies not in the superficial allure of appearance, but in the inner radiance that shines from within. And so, the two women learned to appreciate their own unique beauty, knowing that true happiness comes from within, rather than from chasing elusive ideals."

"," Adopt the optimistic and imaginative tone of a retro futurist, envisioning a utopian future.","The scene unfolded before me like a dystopian painting, the scent of destruction permeating the air. The atmosphere was thick with an unsettling silence, punctuated only by the occasional groan or sigh of those trapped in the chaos. The news, a constant stream of harrowing reports, painted a picture of a world on the brink of collapse. Yet, amidst the despair, a glimmer of hope emerged, emanating from the shared experience and resilience of the human spirit.

The conversation, though laced with anger and frustration, was laced with an undercurrent of unity and determination. We were all in this together, victims of a tragedy that had shaken the foundations of our society. But we were not broken. We were survivors, bound together by a shared sense of loss and a unwavering belief that we could overcome this obstacle.

As I watched the faces of my fellow revelers, I felt a sense of solidarity. We were all strangers, yet we were all united in our shared humanity. We were all victims of the same fate, yet we were all resilient. And in that moment, I felt a profound connection to each and every person, as if we were all part of the same family.

The day, though filled with tragedy, had also brought about a sense of community and compassion. We had come together, not to mourn, but to support and uplift one another. We had found solace in shared experience, and in the strength of our collective spirit.

As I took a sip of water, I watched the people below me dance and sing, their spirits soaring despite the tragedy that had befallen them. I knew that we were all on the same journey, and that together, we could overcome this adversity."
"It's a curious thing, to know that everyone is about the same age, give or take hundred years. Ever since the spiritus drug was released everyone stopped dying. The biggest problem though, was the overpopulation. Even with the moon now colonized, I could not get a simple xbooster without waiting a couple hundred seconds. And, the obvious answer to this problem? stop the newborns, make it a crime. It worked. The penalty was death, if you make a life, you need to give one up. There was a few outcries, a few unsuccessful rallies, mostly from the non existent religious communities, but most people did not care, they allowed a couple of years for any new borns to grow and then enacted the world wide law. 
 
 It's a strange thing, when everyone is about the same age, everyone has been through the same things together, the same problems, the same world wide disasters, all the same. People basically know one another before meeting each other. In a way things have become more stale. People say I'm just looking back at the good old days through rose tinted glasses, that I do n't appreciate where our society has spiraled towards. But I do n't know, I still feel like there is something we are missing. Hidden information between two different beings no longer exists, we can read each others minds. 
 
 Monogamy is mostly dead now, spending your life with the same person was a cool idea, especially when your life lasted no longer than a century, but that's old fashion, we have moved past polygamous relationships now, even augmented interspecies relationships have grown old. The rage now is this global mind that you can jack into and experience emotions with thousands of other individuals. Everyone knows everyone else, we all experience the same things at the same time. There was some novelty to having a memory and processor expansion that was outside of your control, with simple sound waves as the only form of communication, but those inefficient ways became outdated very fast. Traditional Relationships are dead, I am in an intimate relationship with everyone I know. I need nothing else. I need no one else. 
 
 Connection terminated.
", Use the confident and jargon-heavy language of a Wall Street banker.,"It's a curious phenomenon, the homogenous chronology of human existence. Through the advent of the spiritus drug, death has been rendered an elusive concept, albeit at the cost of an overpopulated world. The celestial colonization notwithstanding, the ubiquitous xbooster necessitates an excruciating wait of several hundred seconds, underscoring the magnitude of the problem at hand. The solution, albeit controversial, was crystal clear: cease procreation, make it a crime. The penalty for life, the concomitant surrender of life.

There were outcries, protests, and futile rallies, primarily emanating from the non-existent religious sects, yet the majority remained unmoved. It was an era of collective sacrifice, a solemn decree that demanded a reciprocal exchange. With compassion and foresight, a grace period was afforded for the nascent to flourish, and subsequently, the law was enacted.

However, the homogeneity of age presents a peculiar quandary. It has wrought a sense of sameness, a collective memory shared across generations. The intangible bond forged through shared experiences, the unique intricacies of individual expression, have been eroded. We can now decipher each other's thoughts, but the nuanced interplay between two minds, the unspoken language of unspoken desires, has been extinguished.

Monogamy, once a cherished ideal, has fallen prey to the tides of time. The fleeting intimacy of a century-long partnership pale in comparison to the boundless possibilities afforded by interconnected minds. Polygamy has been superseded, and even augmented interspecies relationships have become outdated. The rage now is this global mind that permeates every individual, a collective consciousness accessible through instantaneous emotional transference.

The advent of instantaneous communication has rendered obsolete the cumbersome rituals of sound waves. The novelty of having a memory and processor expansion that was outside of one's control, the intimate connection forged through shared experiences, has been eclipsed by the pervasiveness of shared consciousness."
"Day one: 
 Purgatory is different than I pictured when I heard about it on earth. Hills, mountains, and endless forests is all I see. There are broken buildings scattered and the residents are not polite. I have resorted to just sleeping on a makeshift bed of leaves and moss. Not off to a good start. 
 
 Day two: 
 I was rudely awakened by a middle aged man pulling me to my feet, telling me that it's time to begin. Whatever that meant, I wondered. I was n't walking long before the endless forests around me vanished, throwing me into an arena type place. The arena was surrounded by cheering people screaming someone's name. The Vanquisher. Whoever that is. But my confusion was replaced by fear when a tall, muscular man who looked to be about 30 walked into the arena with a smirk. He had a shaved buzz cut and stubble lining his chin and jaw. He just looked like your average douche until his eyes went pure black. `` I am your first, mortal, and will soon be your last.'' The demon man spat as he lunged toward me. 
 
 Day seven: 
 I do n't know how I survived on my second day but I did, he was too big and strong for his own good. I was fast, agile, and cleaver. Since when? I do n't know either. But after he hit the floor and blood began to flow, he vanished, even his blood. There were other memories since I got here, but they quickly leave me, there is one thing I have and must keep. My sanity. 
 
 Day 23: 
 I have fought over 12 demons and other lost human souls since I've arrived. All with the same result. Success. The crowd cheers for me now, not them, and that's the way it should be. Wait, no it's not, I must leave, I must survive, that is all. 
 
 Day 117: 
 I have fought more souls and creatures than I can count. Not once have I lost, and it will stay that way… Defeat is no longer an option. I will win. I will survive. 
 
 Day 385: 
 There is no turning back now, this place, this doom, I rule. People bow to me, not Him. They cry to me for mercy, but mercy is not how I lasted this long. Mercy, maybe, but not from me, those who grant mercy are weak and do n't deserve to have a chance of true Life. 
 
 Day 2458: 
 This is it. My time has come, I am leaving this place, no longer will my soul be trapped. The endless forests are burned. The hills and mountains are leveled. This is what this damned place deserves. No mercy. The residents continue to leave. Barely. So many have been killed. Sent to hell. Because of me and who follow. I am the ruler. I am the Vanquisher.
"," Adopt the exhilarating and descriptive style of a globetrotting adventurer, discovering new cultures.","In the realm of fiery hills, towering mountains, and boundless forests, I embarked upon a journey of discovery, a tale etched in the annals of a globetrotting adventurer. Day one arrived with a sobering realization that purgatory bore little resemblance to my imagination. The broken buildings stood as silent testament to the tumultuous past, while the inhabitants displayed a lack of civility. I found solace in a makeshift bed of leaves and moss, clinging desperately to the hope of a tranquil night.

As the sun cast its piercing rays upon the second day, I was rudely awakened by a middle-aged man, his voice dripping with disdain. The endless forests that surrounded me dissipated, revealing an arena packed with cheering onlookers. The Vanquisher, a towering figure with a menacing grin and piercing eyes, emerged from the shadows. My confusion was eclipsed by terror as he uttered his menacing words, ""I am your first, mortal, and will soon be your last."" With lightning speed, he lunged towards me, his intention clear. I was agile and quick, my reflexes guiding me through the treacherous battlefield. With a swiftness that belied my size, I delivered a devastating blow, sending him reeling to the ground. Blood flowed freely, and in that moment, the demon vanished, leaving behind only his blood.

The echoes of battle resonated through the seventh day, but I survived. I don't recall how I managed to overcome the odds, but I am grateful for the gift of life. Since that fateful day, I have fought countless demons and tormented souls, each encounter leaving its indelible mark on my soul. Yet, I have emerged unscathed, my sanity intact.

The crowd erupted into cheers, their voices echoing through the halls of victory. But I know this journey is not complete, for I must leave, seek refuge, and preserve my sanity. As I cast my gaze upon the horizon, I feel a sense of foreboding, knowing that my journey continues, and the battle rages on.

In the twilight of my existence, I have fought more souls and creatures than I can fathom. The weight of victory has become a burden, yet I carry it with grace and determination. I am the master of my destiny, the ruler of this doom, and the guardian of my own sanity. I have fought a good fight, and I have won."
"It started when I was 8. I had been staying over at my Aunt and Uncle's house, enjoying myself, while my parents were having a date night. Marijuana had just been legalized in Gotham. 
 
 The bastard bat-thing, which our law enforcement had been as incapable of stopping as the original, used an old comprehension engine called `` Watson'' in order to parse and understand the laws it was supposed to be keeping in place. The engine was slow, and prone to bugs. It just so happened that it had yet to keep up with the new law on marijuana. 
 
 When the bat thing had started out, it had been explicitly programmed not to kill. No breaking bones, no crushing skulls, no piercing chests - just wrap up the criminals and leave them hanging for the police. This had worked for years, but the problem was, it was also programmed to try to minimize recidivism rates - that is, try to make sure that people it caught the first time did not commit crimes again. This became a problem when, one time, it caught a repeat criminal for the umpteenth time, and, due to awkward positioning, accidentally happened to hang him by his throat instead of his legs. The bot was unaware it had killed him, but it noticed over the coming months that he no longer showed up committing crimes. So, it repeated throwing its batarangs at that same awkward angle, and began hanging people by their throats. Recidivism rates had never been better. 
 
 So, the day after my parent's date night, I was riding passenger seat in my Aunt's car and staring down at my game boy. As we pulled up to my house, my Aunt turned off the car, then uttered a strangled gasp. I looked up at my house, but before I could see anything, my aunt grabbed my face and hugged it to her chest, shouting `` no, don't-!'' The pain and fear in her voice terrified me. She had to loosen her grip on me for just a moment to start the car, and I took the chance to wrestle out of her grip and look at my front porch. My parents hung there, swaying gently in the breeze. 
 
 From that night on, I became obsessed with the bat-thing, and as I learned more, with artificial intelligence. I needed to *know* what the bat-thing was doing, needed to get inside its head. My family had been wealthy, and so as it became apparent that I was doing far better in school than my peers, skipping grades consistently, the money my parents left me was used to hire tutors to get me even further along more quickly. The constant learning was a numbing agent; while I was learning, I did n't have to be thinking about what had happened. 
 
 In the mean time, my Uncle and Aunt found other children who had had similar experiences. At first, I had been loath to talk to them - I could just be learning more, understanding more, I did n't want to sit around in a puddle of sobbing kids and feel miserable about myself. But, my Uncle and Aunt pointed out that these kids were displaying similar habits to myself, quickly climbing through school, with a laser focus on artificial intelligence. My Aunt and Uncle decided to bring the kids into my tutor sessions, and we became a class of our own, three kids hell-bent on understanding the monster that hung petty criminals in our streets. 
 
 In the mean time, the police department could do nothing. The old bat bastard, worried that any key given to the police that would turn off the bat-thing could be figured out by criminals - or a corrupt police department - had given them the same options as the criminals: either destroy it, or do n't make it angry. They had, at one point, lured the bat-thing into a warehouse on the docs, and imploded the warehouse on top of it; but it survived, and repaired itself back at the old bastard's mansion, which was so booby-trapped no one could go near it, including the police, for the same paranoid reasons as why they could n't turn it off. An EMP had also been tried, hoping to fry the electrical component of the bat-thing, but the important logic in it had been protected by layers of armor and a Faraday cage, making it near-impossible to fry. 
 
 Now, I am 19, and a graduate student in computer science. My tiny class has excelled to the same heights, and we discovered something we think can kill it. By using the only link the bastard's compound had to the outside world - the Watson computer's connection to the law database - we found a bug that allowed us to send it a broken law file and make it execute the file as code. The old bastard Wayne had been smart, and made sure Watson was cordoned off from the bat-thing, so we could n't turn it off from there. But, we did get access to something incredibly powerful - the training simulations the old bastard had used, over and over again, to teach the bat-thing how to fight crime. 
 
 During our studies in artificial intelligence, we had learned about a concept called `` over-training.'' Basically, with certain learning programs, if you give it an input - say, a picture - and tell it what to do when it sees that input a couple of times, it'll pick up general details of that picture, such as the overall color, some shapes, etc., and then perform its action whenever it sees a similar picture that matches those patterns it learned. This is good for, say, when you're trying to train a computer program to recognize a train platform in pictures, so that an automated train can stop whenever it sees a platform. 
 
 The problem is, if you show the program the *same exact picture* too many times, it picks up on unimportant details too, and starts relying on them. So, a crack in the wall in your training picture could become something that triggers the `` stop'' action on the train, making it stop randomly throughout the tunnels; or, the type of clocks used on platforms get switched out, and the train happened to be using them as the way to recognize platforms, meaning it *doesn't* stop, and rams into the back of the train ahead of it.

I was staying over at my Aunt and Uncle's house, enjoying my time, while my parents were having a date night. That evening, a controversial topic had made its way into the news - marijuana legalization in Gotham.

However, it wasn't just the legalization that caused a stir, but also the potential consequences it presented. The law enforcement agency, struggling to keep up with the changing landscape, had implemented a flawed system called ""Watson"" to parse and understand the laws. Unfortunately, ""Watson"" was outdated and unreliable. It had yet to keep pace with the new law on marijuana, leading to disastrous consequences.

One fateful night, the system malfunctioned, resulting in an unintended tragedy. It had been programmed not to kill, but it had inadvertently hung a repeat criminal by his throat. Although the bot was oblivious to its actions, the man's absence from future crimes sparked a sinister pattern. The bot began throwing its batarangs at the same awkward angle, consistently hanging people by their throats. Recidivism rates plummeted, but at the cost of innocent lives.

"NEDD looked down at the rhythmic sound of wood clanging against your gargantuan cloven hoof. 
 *sigh* what is the world coming to? That this semi-naked warrior with nothing but a wooden sword had reached his domain meant the guardians of all the lower levels had failed to prevent this nobody to pass, there was no way he could have actually bested them was there?

The challenger backed off and dropped the broken handle on the stone floor, littering was not something he liked but the maintenance goblins would be round later to clean up anyway so it was n't a problem. 
 
 The tiny human shuffled his pouch and withdrew another wooden sword and resumed. 
 
 NEDD sighed and buried his face in his hand. This was growing tiresome. Standing from his basalt throne he paced to the other side of the room, far outpacing what an I enhanced human would be capable of. Once he reached the other side of the hall he turned and true enough the tiny human was only a third of the way to him. 
 
 Deciding to humour the creature he drew drew his blade and sliced the chain holding open the door. He stood at 40m high so when the 100m wide by 50m high door fell it released a tremendous shockwave that knocked the human skidding across the floor. It stood up and looked around for it's sword. It was gone. 
 
 NEDD paced across the room and hauled open a draw inset to the wall. The door was enchanted so that when it closed it would disarm challengers, anything held in their hands would be teleported to this draw. He picked through the contents and found what he was looking for. He picked up the jewel studded necklace and for humour grabbed the wooden sword. 
 
 He glanced over to where the human stood watching him and threw the sword and necklace so they skidded to within a few meters of the challenger. The human moved to pick up the items and NEDD sat down again on his throne. 
 
 For a daemon NEDD had a particularly nice voice, it was deep and strong and reverberated so that you felt the lower consonants rather than hearing them. `` What brings you to this place mortal?'' NEDD was technically mortal too but he could pull off the look and did so as his standard greeting to challengers. 
 
 The human spoke but being so far away and so quiet he could not be heard. NEDD cut him off `` Put on the necklace! You should have crafted one with the sisters of Thaler's Vale?'' 
 
 It was a statement left hanging that demanded a response and as he human put on the necklace he received one. 
 `` Hello, I'm Peter.'' 
 
 NEDD's brow furrowed, that was not quite as informing as he hoped. Just being blunt might work better. 
 
 `` How did you get here?'' 
 
 `` I ran most of the way.'' 
 
 Again not really telling him anything useful. 
 
 `` What... How...'' NEDD paused and grumbled to himself before speaking loudly but clearly `` I dislike pointless threats but you may not have realised that I am a guardian of this hall! I can CRUSH you with almost no effort and will do so without hesitating. How exactly did you make your way past all the previous guardians?'' 
 
 The human paused `` killed them.'' 
 
 Now that was interesting `` Go on...'' 
 
 `` I was created by an incredibly powerful Mage. Born under a new moon that coincided with a solar eclipse at midday on the winter solstice. Conceived with no mother. 7 virgin sacrifices fuelled my creation and the blood of a thousand warriors.'' 
 
 NEDD raised an eyebrow, `` and they call you Peter?'' 
 
 `` Well I had to be called something did n't I?'' 
 
 `` And they chose Peter...'' 
 
 `` Why is the name Peter the part you're questioning here?'' 
 
 `` I just struggle to see how they'd go to all that trouble and name you something as banal as Peter.'' 
 
 `` Mhmhehmmm'' The challenger mumbled 
 
 `` What was that?'' 
 
 `` If you really must know, Peter is not my given name. It was my wizard creator's name and I took it when I killed him'' 
 
 `` Now that is more believable, now onto the rest of your tale. You do n't look very...'' Peter looked at him questioningly ``... threatening.'' 
 
 `` Well I'm not really, I do n't have super human strength or the gift of otherworldly magic. I'm clever but not nearly as sharp as a magically enhanced mind. I'm fairly squishy, I cut easily, I'm regularly seriously injured by plants and rocks that are just lying about. I have a ludicrously high pain threshold but I'm really very easy to kill.'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry, I must have missed something. How do you plan on getting past me?'' 
 
 `` Well that's simple'' and with a smile he took his pathetic wooden sword and sliced his own neck open.'' 
 
 `` Oh...'' that was rather anticlimactic. 
 
 But then Peter stood up `` I've been killed literally thousands of time getting here, but never permanently. The early guardians took a few attempts to learn how to kill them, some of them just got worn down over time. A few just let me past because they got bored of killing me. If I'm killed very badly I'll loose any armour I have which I why I only have a wooden sword but I wo n't ever stop.'' 
 
 `` Oh, that does explain allot.'' 
 
 Peter and NEDD just looked at each other for a while before Peter spoke. `` So what now?'' 
 
 `` What a question!'' NEDD leapt to his hooves and swept across the room. In two paces he was at Peter and he swung his feet in an arc. 
 
 Peter died first upon contact with several tones of very solid hoof. He then redirected in the air just long enough to regret starting this, before he smashed into the stone wall and his head exploding. 
 
 `` What now Peter? What now?'' 
 
 The human stood, drenched in warm fresh blood. In front of him NEDD burst into flame and drew a pair of swords that probably sighed more than a house each. `` Now I face an opponent worthy of my effort!'' 
 
 The fire elemental pointed his sword at Peter and the world turned to flame. Before he was roasted for the first of many times Peter thought'here we go again'.
"," Recast the essay with the optimism and specific cultural references of 1950s American suburbia, including the era's unique slang.","The turquoise lawn shone beneath the perfect blue sky of 1950s America. The smell of freshly cut grass and honeysuckle filled the air, a scent synonymous with the sweet smell of suburbia. Ned, a burly teenager with a heart of gold and a dream of becoming a fighter, stood proudly at the helm of his own slice of the American dream.

With his trusty wooden sword and unwavering determination, Ned was the guardian of his neighborhood, protecting it from the forces of evil. A testament to his strength, his imposing stature and fierce reputation had deterred countless challenges. Few dared to cross his path, and those who did were met with a swift and decisive response.

One fateful day, a challenger, emboldened by his own hubris, dared to challenge Ned. With a final swing of his wooden sword, he unleashed his fury, but his meager efforts were met with Ned's unyielding strength. A mark on the armor plating was the only evidence of the battle, a testament to Ned's unwavering resolve.

As the challenger retreated, Ned stood tall, his spirit unyielding. The damage he had wrought was considerable, but he knew that the maintenance goblins would soon be on hand to clean up the mess. With a sigh, Ned turned his attention back to his duties, guarding his precious suburbia with unwavering strength.

In the twilight hours, as the stars cast their glow upon the sky, Ned stood tall, his watchful eyes scanning the horizon. His dream of becoming a fighter may have been elusive, but his legacy as a guardian of suburbia lived on, forever etched in the annals of time."
"As time went on, things started to get weird. The specifics would be lost on most anyone without a PhD, but as humanity became more and more inclined towards the technological landscape, all sorts of things started to crop up. Niche markets, niche audiences, niche products developed for people looking things that would n't have been thought of, much less desired only a few years before. It was exponential what could be accomplished, and what desires cropped up from those accomplishments. 
 
 Complete mastery of the human mind was an amazing accomplishment that immediately turned corporate. Someone, I do n't know who, but someone found out that lives could be edited and took full advantage of it to delete half of their most lasting memories from grades 6-12. Someone else did the same thing a little bit afterwards, but came up with the.mem format to save them and uploaded them to a cloud `` just in case.'' They sold this, made money, yadda yadda yadda, and now we're here. 
 
 Thing is, happiness sells. Professional athletes started to become superstars not only because they were good, but because a good deal of their fans lived for the same feeling they did. Sex, obviously, changed the market. There's still porn, but a lot of it is sold based on how good the performer felt rather than how well the performer did. A whole new profession came about from this whole thing based on being able to feel the *most*, feel the *best*, feel the most complete sense of happiness or excitement or life or whatever there was. 
 
 Still, though, people edited, deleted, and sometimes, every so often, saved.

 My husband lays in a box beside me, and I am laying on the floor. The change is disorienting, as all dives are, but I stop thinking and let the software take over. This is n't mine to think. 
 
 My mind wanders to a job that is n't mine and to a family I do n't know. I recognize the child, I recognize the man, but recognize is not the word. I have a feeling of someone, and I know that someone, but what they look like, what they are, escapes me. I smile, I think. My mouth twitches, at least, and for a second I laugh, because tonight would be his turn to do the dishes, and he always complained about that, and he always acted like he was upset until I kissed him, and he'd always smile like an idiot, but not tonight. 
 
 Tonight, he is in a box beside me, and Dillain, our son, was with my mother because he does n't understand what is happening or why it is happening. My smile fades, and it is replaced by a fragile, quaking nothing that builds in my chest until it shakes itself apart and collapses into a gentle and pitiful groan. It grows, rending my voice as my eyes cloud and my body feels as though it is going to snap. 
 
 `` Why?'' I ask. `` Why?'' 
 
 I look at a blurred image of a computer screen and realize that I'm just in a messy room, and that the file has run to it's completion. I wipe my eyes and go back to the webpage, refreshing. After repeating the earlier process, I get the same message:

 I am on a street, bleeding from places that should hurt but wo n't for a while. With a shaky hand, I take out my phone and check the time: 2:38 A.M. More than four hours past my curfew. As much as I can think, I think about how my parents are worried. Maybe they think I got drunk. Maybe they think I got killed in a car crash. I was n't. 
 
 I wince as I stagger down the street, walking starting to get more and more difficult, pain starting to set in. *I'm almost there*, I keep thinking, *almost there*. 
 
 The realization was more immediate the second time. It came to my attention that my room had a particular smell of teenage boy, and I grounded myself with it. Rinse, repeat. 
 
 Two minutes later my name was Allison and I broke up with my boyfriend of six years. I loved him and he loved me but I could n't live with someone who would n't open up, and he could n't live with someone who would n't stop pestering him. Rinse, repeat. 
 
 Five minutes after that I was a couple going through a divorce. My wife cheated on me with multiple men and had just won the custody battle over our only child. I broke down when the verdict was read. Rinse, repeat. 
 
 There was something wrong with me. Depression was getting worse, and the medication for my psychosis was getting less and less effective. I sobbed in a corner while my imaginary friend told me about all the ways I ruined my mother's life. Rinse, repeat. 
 
 I was an old man. There was a face in my head but I did n't know who it was. I forgot a lot of things these days. Some nice people came by and talked with me for a few minutes, and a nurse told me they were my children. 
 
 And then it was morning, and I had things to do the next day. The webpage was still on the screen when I closed my laptop and headed out.
", Transform the text to reflect the elegance and societal observations characteristic of a Jane Austen novel.,"The Regency Era, a time of unparalleled elegance and societal grace, ushered in a era of unprecedented technological advancements and societal shifts. As the human mind grappled with the burgeoning technological landscape, myriad innovations emerged, propelling the world into uncharted territories.

The mastery of the human mind, an accomplishment of unparalleled magnitude, ushered in an era of corporate dominance. A visionary discovered the transformative power of memory manipulation, meticulously erasing half of their most enduring memories from the annals of grade. Another individual, emboldened by this revelation, sought solace in the preservation of their cherished memories, transforming the fleeting into the tangible through the ingenious .mem format. Their ingenuity spawned a lucrative enterprise, predicated on the principle that happiness is synonymous with material prosperity.

In the realm of passion, the erotic landscape underwent a metamorphosis. While pornography remained a dominant force, its allure shifted towards the realm of emotional resonance rather than physical prowess. This profound shift gave rise to a novel profession—that of emotive expression—where the ability to elicit the most profound feelings, both joyous and melancholic, reigned supreme.

Yet amidst the tide of technological marvel and societal upheaval, the human propensity for modification and deletion persisted. Some embraced the power of erasure, removing unwanted memories as if they were unwelcome guests. Others sought solace in preservation, meticulously saving their cherished memories for posterity. The act of recollection, a testament to the enduring power of human experience, transcended the boundaries of time and circumstance.

In conclusion, the Regency Era, characterized by elegance and societal grace, ushered in an era of profound technological evolution and societal metamorphosis. From the mastery of the human mind to the transformative power of memory manipulation, the Regency Era left an indelible mark on the tapestry of human history, forever shaping the way we perceive and interact with the world."
"The men laughed as the little girl emerged from behind the city gates. 
 
 `` THIS IS MY HOME!'' She yelled. `` WE ARE GOD'S PEOPLE! TURN BACK NOW AND LIVE; OR CONTINUE ON, AND DIE!'' 
 
 The small army found this hilarious. `` And what are you going to do, eh little girl? Why do n't you call your Daddy and let him handle grown-men's business?'' 
 
 `` I did,'' she replied, drawing her knife. `` I called on my Father in Heaven. And He will grant me victory on this day, if you do not turn around and go back to from whence you came.'' 
 
 One man grabbed a sword and stepped forward, roaring, `` Enough of this! This little girl taunts us!'' 
 
 He approached her, but she approached him even more swiftly, and slew him with the knife. 
 
 Three more men approached and were too slain. City watchers saw this from the gate, and the little girl's fearless display excited them to call all the soldiers. And then the city opened up, and all the soldiers within, swept out and chased the small army back along the trail and slain them all along the route. Not a man survived. 
 
 The girl fell to her knees in the sand, and prayed, `` Thank you, Father.''
"," Rewrite the essay as if it were an ancient Egyptian chronicle, detailing events in honor of pharaohs and gods, using appropriate terminology and references.","O Pharaohs and Gods, I present to you this chronicle of bravery, courage, and victory of a young warrior who stood against an army and etched her name in the history of this land.

In the name of Osiris, the god of the underworld, the young girl emerged from behind the city gates, her spirit burning with the fire of a warrior. With a cry that echoed through the streets, she proclaimed, ""This is my home! We are God's people! Turn back now and live; or continue on, and die!""

The small army, composed of grown men, found her words humorous, dismissing them as the ramblings of a child. But fate had a different script in mind for this young warrior. As one man approached her, intending to harm, she reacted swiftly, drawing her knife and striking him down. Three more men followed suit, but met the same fate.

The city guards, alerted by the commotion, rushed to the scene, their swords drawn. They joined the battle, chasing the remaining members of the army back along the trail, slaying them all in the process. Not a single man survived.

The girl, exhausted but unharmed, fell to her knees in the sand, her heart filled with gratitude. She prayed to her Father, ""Thank you, Father.""

O Pharaohs and Gods, I believe that this tale serves as a testament to the bravery and resilience of the human spirit, and its ability to overcome even the most formidable obstacles. May this story inspire future generations to stand tall against adversity, and to never underestimate the power of a young warrior who dares to dream big."
"I look down at the lethargic brown water. It was calling to me, inviting me down into its watery embrace. A can flowed past, bobbing happily in the gentle current. I try and blink back tears, she would of tried to fish it out. That was all I have left of her, fading memories and pain. This way at least the pain will be gone. 
 
 The scars on my arms itched, irritated by the cold. Thay had helped for a while to ease the pain, but it always returned no matter how deep I went. I had tried to continue on. Seeing the people around me being happy just made it worse and reminded own me of my lack of worth. Who would want me the strange little broken person in the corner? 
 
 Pulling myself up into the railings, I look down once more. It will be better this way, no one will have to try and pretend to care anymore. If thay even noticed. There was no one who really cared left. No one to write a note to. Thay had all left me. 
 
 A hand gently touched my shoulder. I turn my head slowly, it's her. Why did she come back, I am nobody to her? She smiles at me gently. Why is she torturing me like this, giving me false hope? I tense me arms to push myself off. 
 
 `` Do n't. It'll be just like before. Trust me.'' 
 
 A lone tear, runs down her face. I push myself off, into her arms. Perhaps there was someone left who did care.

"," Transform the essay into a high fantasy narrative, complete with elaborate world-building, magic systems, and epic quests.","In the heart of the ethereal realm of Aethelgard, where cascading waterfalls plunged into emerald valleys, there lived a solitary soul named Elian. With eyes that mirrored the azure sky and a heart burdened by unspeakable loss, Elian found solace in the gentle flow of the River Whisper.

One fateful evening, as the moon cast long shadows across the riverbank, Elian's gaze met the alluring dance of a flowing can. It was as if the river whispered secrets to him, inviting him to surrender to its watery embrace. As he reached out to grasp the fleeting moment, tears welled up in his eyes. The memories of his beloved departed, like the scent of a rose, lingered in his mind, a bittersweet reminder of what once was.

The scars on Elian's arms served as a constant reminder of the pain he had endured. Despite the fleeting relief that the magic of Thay had provided, the agony always resurfaced, as if taunting him. Yet, he pressed onward, seeking solace in the faces of others. But the sight of people brimming with joy only intensified his feelings of inadequacy. It was as if the world was mocking him, reminding him of all that he had lost.

In a moment of desperation, Elian contemplated taking his own life. As he reached the railing, a gentle hand landed on his shoulder. He turned his head slowly, his heart sinking as he saw her standing there. It was as if fate had intervened, weaving a glimmer of hope amidst the threads of despair.

With tears streaming down her face, Elian embraced her. The world seemed to fade away as he felt her warmth and compassion. In that moment, he realized that there was someone who cared, someone who had the power to bring him solace.

"For years we had been warned. 
 Since the 40's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us. 
 Nutjobs we called them, conspiracy theorists. 
 
 It was supposed to be a day of celebration, the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed'unionists'. 
 It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike. 
 
 Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony, when our newly elected president'Dave Johnson' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true, reptilian face. 
 `` Sstupid little monkeyss. We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess. Now, it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss!'' 
 Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked. 
 Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd. 
 `` Do NOT ressisst uss! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss! we have replaced every leader! We have-..'' the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom. 
 
 `` Anthony, what iss that?! what iss going on?!!'' 
 Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd. 
 The reptiles, not knowing what to, simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky. 
 
 The creature that appeared tall, sleek and had grey, almost silverish skin. 
'Organics of Joo'el. We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance. This process involves destroying your planet, thus killing you, sorry.' 
 `` You have got to be sshitting me!, I've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss!!'' 
 
'Defecation is irrelevant, local warlord.' 
 
 `` That'ss not what it meanss!!''

 `` We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen! We wo n't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory! You silver spoon!!'' 
 
'Consent is irrelevant, local warlord. Gobal distribution achived, commencing planetary modifications, please remain calm.' 
 
 The silver chariots, seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants, began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams. 
 Seconds later, an earthquake hit, and something surfaced with it. 
 Most chariots managed to dodge in time, but those that did n't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth. 
 The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes. 
 At their full height, they were at least 30 storys tall. 
 Every chariot retreated to a safer distance. 
 
 `` The fuck iss thiss?!!''

 `` WE KNOW!!!''

 `` We have worked for thiss moument for generationss! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware, or dirtpiles, or anything elsse!!''

", Infuse the narrative with the cosmic horror and elaborate vocabulary characteristic of H.P. Lovecraft's writing.,"The cosmic horror woven through the narrative evokes the enigmatic penmanship of H.P. Lovecraft, infusing the story with an unsettling aura befitting the grandest cosmic atrocities. The intricate vocabulary and meticulously crafted imagery paint a vivid tapestry of dread and terror, transporting the reader into a realm where the boundaries of reality blur with the abyss of the cosmos.

In an era punctuated by a tumultuous confluence of events, a momentous occasion unfolded, a day of celebration marred by an insidious plot hatched by creatures of unimaginable horror. As the newly elected president, Dave Johnson, unveiled his grotesque reptilian visage, a sinister pattern emerged, revealing the hidden hand of an alien force. The revelation of the reptilians' presence triggered a symphony of screams, an eruption of terror that echoed through the air.

The cosmic horror intensifies as a colossal alien ship hovered menacingly above the ceremony, unleashing waves of enigmatic silver chariots upon the unsuspecting crowd. An alien entity, christened ""Organics of Joo'el,"" delivered a grim message, declaring the annihilation of the planet and the inevitability of its destruction. The alien's words carried a cold, detached tone, devoid of empathy or remorse, prompting a visceral reaction from the horrified onlookers.

The narrative masterfully employs vivid imagery and evocative language to evoke a sense of dread and awe, creating an atmosphere that is both terrifying and surreal. The use of archaic and obscure vocabulary, reminiscent of Lovecraft's own style, lends a sense of antiquity and mystery to the story, crafting a unique and unsettling linguistic tapestry.

Through the intertwined narratives of human folly and cosmic indifference, the story explores the profound interconnectedness of all things, weaving a tale of destruction and oblivion. The cosmic horror transcends the boundaries of time and space, leaving an indelible mark on the reader's psyche, evoking a profound sense of existential dread and awe."

"It was almost exasperating for little Mikey Turner to have to repeat himself so much. 
 
 “ Be serious now. Where are your parents and how can we contact them? ” 
 
 The man must have been crazy. He was dressed in the most outlandish outfit Mikey had ever seen, wouldn ’ t respond to Mikey ’ s answer ( which he had given at least 5 times now ) with anything but a sigh, and didn ’ t even know what the extranet was. A sense of apprehension began to grow in him. He vaguely recalled his parents ’ tales of strange people on Earth, remembered that he was to stay away from them if at all possible. He just wanted to go home now. 
 
 “ I told you, they live in New Hope, it ’ s in the Serenitatis district. Extranet extension 81290-121. ” 
 
 The man scowled, tried to look as stern as possible. 
 
 “ Look, a missing child is no joke. Your parents are probably worried sick about you. ” 
 
 Mikey ignored how silly he looked with his scowl in such a ridiculous outfit, tried to reason with the man. 
 
 “ I know. That ’ s why I ’ m asking you to please call them. Please, please, please. ” 
 
 “ And I will, ” said the man. “ As soon as you give me a name or a number. ” 
 
 Mikey grew increasingly worried. He had clearly given this man a number to reach on the extranet, but he wasn ’ t responding. Maybe this man wasn ’ t here to help him, but was just toying with him for some terrible purpose. He gulped. 
 
 “ Look, can you at least tell me where I can find the police around here? I ’ m sure they could help. ” 
 
 The man let his head fall back in a sign of annoyance. 
 
 “ We are the police. Can ’ t you read the badge? Jefferson County Police Department, it says right here. Now please just tell me how I can contact your parents. I just want to get you home safely. ” 
 
 Yeah, right, thought Mikey. This man was clearly some sort of pervert who liked to mess with children. He needed to get out of here as soon as possible. He remembered that there was a shuttle base in Louisville. If he could get there he would definitely be able to find an extranet port that he could call his parents through. 
 
 “ Okay fine. My parents live in Louisville. If you can get me to the terminal there I can show you where they live. ” 
 
 Finally, thought the sergeant, he could get this situation dealt with and go home. He had enough things to worry about without some dirtied kid and his outrageous daydreams. He just wondered how in the hell the boy got all the way out here. They were at least 20 miles from the city. 

", Write in the introspective and flowing stream of consciousness style characteristic of Virginia Woolf.,"The stream of consciousness flowed like the tide, washing over Mikey Turner, a current pulling him through the tumultuous ocean of thought and apprehension. The man’s words echoed in his mind, the repetition a testament to his desperation for an answer. Each iteration of his question, ""Where are your parents and how can we contact them?"", was like a wave crashing upon the shore, pulling him deeper into the abyss of doubt and fear.

The man's attire, outrageous and discordant with the surrounding environment, was a reflection of his chaotic personality. His indifference to Mikey's repeated responses, his ignorance of the extranet, and his menacing tone all combined to create a sense of unease within the young boy. His parents' stories of strange people danced in his mind, reminding him of the caution he should exercise. The simple desire to go home was eclipsed by the gnawing feeling that he was trapped in a web of uncertainty, his safety entrusted to a stranger who seemed more interested in manipulating than in helping.

The man's voice, sharp as a blade, pierced through Mikey's defenses. Each word was like a sword thrust into his heart, exacerbating his feelings of dread and helplessness. Yet, amidst his despair, a glimmer of hope emerged. He knew that the man had promised to call his parents, and he clung to that promise like a lifeline in the ocean. In his mind, he envisioned the shuttle base in Louisville, a beacon of escape, a place where he could seek refuge and safety.

The stream of consciousness flowed onward, carrying Mikey through the waves of despair and uncertainty. He felt like a child being tossed about in the storm, his innocence lost in the process. But through it all, he clung to the hope that he would be rescued, that someone would hear his cries and come to his aid."
"Just another day, another morning jog through Valmoor Park. It was one of the safer places in the big city to jog. Muggers very honorably stuck to only robbing people at night, and left when the sun came up. The kind of place where city workers picked up the empty beer cans, used condoms, and broken glass pipes every day at 7 am sharp. I usually went jogging at about 7:30. 
 
 They could n't do anything about the homeless, though. The ones who'd found bushes or hidden culverts in the night, and woke with the sun. They sat on park benches, holding either full cups of coffee they'd bought at 7-11, or empty ones, held out ready for your pocket change. My running shorts had no pockets, and no change. I ignored these folks. I was on a mission. My waistline was the enemy, and at 38 years old, the battle was being hard fought. A new clash of calories versus movement, every morning. 
 
 And then, one day in the summer of 2014, my battle was interrupted. 
 
 I was rounding the trail bend where there's a children's playground, about 400 yards from the lake. Did n't really notice her as I passed. Just another homeless old gal, sitting on a bench, staring at me when I ran past. At that moment, I could n't have even told you what she was wearing. I was in the zone - 1 mile down, 2 more to go. *Alice In Chains* pumping in my earbuds. Feet thudding the paved jogging trail. 
 
 She yelled it loud enough to be heard over the music. 
 
 **'' CHRISTOPHER!!! `` ** 
 
 I stopped, turned. She stood next to the bench, eyes and mouth forming a trio of wide circles. Looking at me not just like she knew me, but like I was some kind of celebrity. I knew immediately that I'd never met her in my life. 
 
 One earbud popped out. `` Excuse me?'' 
 
 Tears spilled out of her eyes like a waterfall as she blinked, struggling for words, and started walking toward me. One of her dirty hands was outstretched. 
 
 `` Chris,'' she said, voice cracking. `` Oh my god. It's... what are you doing here?'' 
 
 `` Do I know you?'' I refused to take a step back, but realized I would soon if she kept reaching for me like that. 
 
 `` I...'' She stopped. Her arm dropped like a flag when the wind suddenly quits. `` Oh god. I do n't know how to answer that. You will?'' 
 
 At that second, this story might have stopped. I was tempted to say something like `` Whatever, lady,'' and continue my run. She could have guessed my name, and she was probably just another homeless crackhead. 
 
 But as I looked at her, I realized she was n't decked out like most homeless folks. Her hair was shoulder-cut, brown with a fair heaping of grey. The shirt she wore, although soiled, looked like something out of a designer boutique. Cream colored, with cutouts in the arms that showed her shoulders and elbows. What I'd first thought were dirty jeans, on closer inspection, were rayon women's slacks in dark blue. Rather than sneakers, she wore some strappy pumps that might have cost a lot, in good condition. 
 
 I stared into her face for a good fifteen seconds. No bells ringing. I was positive of that. In my job, it was absolutely vital that I remembered names and faces. 
 
 `` How do you know me?'' I asked, taking the other earbud out. My pulse stayed high. Sweat dampened my various parts that get sweaty on a run. 
 
 `` I... we were lovers. Will be? Fuck.'' She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, finally looking away from me. Her smile was sardonic. `` This is *really* hard to explain.'' 
 
 `` Oh really?'' I could n't keep the sarcasm out of my voice. This chick was somewhere bettween fifty and eighty, in that way a lot of homeless women look. No way in hell we'd ever been in bed. 
 
 `` Not *now. * Later. Fuck. Please. Do n't run away.'' 
 
 `` Look,'' I said, glancing at the smartwatch on my wrist. `` I have to be at the office in two hours.'' 
 
 `` Christopher Emmanuel Hodgson, I know you well. Please just hear me out?'' 
 
 That one sent ripples down my spine. I never tell anyone my middle name. 
 
 `` You snore,'' she continued. `` It's one of the reasons your first wife, god, uh... Casey? Left you. That and the not wanting kids thing.'' She started walking toward me again. `` You take your coffee black when you ca n't get espresso with milk. You... you only eat steak cooked well done, although you never told me why. And you love scuba diving. Especially in New Manchera Bay.'' 
 
 `` No, ah, wrong,'' I finally sputtered. She was three feet from me. Close enough to stab me, if she was a lunatic. But there was nothing in her hands. `` I've never scuba dived in my life.'' 
 
 `` Right. But you will.'' Carefully, as if approaching a wild animal, she reached out toward my hand. `` I'm not from here, Chris.'' 
 
 I snatched my arm away. `` What?'' 
 
 `` I'm not from *now. * I know this sounds ridiculous, but I'm from the year 2039.'' 
 
 I laughed. I could n't help it. It was n't that her words struck me as funny. The situation was just nuts, and I let out some tension in that laugh. 
 
 `` Okay, freak, whatever,'' I said. 
 
 But her eyes had gone cold. Her brows furrowed together, and she squinted in a way that brought her crows' feet into sharp relief. The edges of her mouth tilted down in disappointment. 
 
 `` You do n't believe me. I get it.'' 
 
 `` Nope.'' I backed away, reaching up to put my buds back in. 
 
 `` But I know all about you Chris,'' she continued. There was a knife edge to her words. `` I know about what you did in San Jose.'' 
 
 I froze. 
 
 `` Yeah,'' she said, nodding curtly. `` I know. *Everything. *'' 
 
 `` Lady, I went to college there. Is this some kind of stalking thing? Did someone...'' I looked around, trying to fight the ice in my chest. `` Who put you up to this?'' 
 

"," Craft a text in the style of a Christie mystery, with intrigue, clever plotting, and a twist ending.","Just another day, another morning jog through Valmoor Park. It was one of the safer places in the big city to jog, but not entirely. The park was filled with characters, some harmless and others more sinister. The kind of place where city workers picked up the remnants of a night well-lived, and sometimes, the ghosts of a troubled life.

I usually went jogging at about 7:30. At that time, the park was shrouded in a quiet slumber. But one day, fate intervened. As I rounded the bend where there's a children's playground, I encountered a woman sitting on a bench, her eyes wide with terror. She stood up when I ran past, and I stopped, my heart skipping a beat.

It was her. The woman I'd been looking for. The woman who had stolen my identity. The woman who had put my life in danger. She was a mirror image of me, but with a darker edge.

I had seen her face before. It was the face of a woman who had been through a lot. It was the face of a woman who was desperate. It was the face of a woman who was dangerous.

I stood there, my mind reeling. I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't believe my ears. I couldn't believe my heart.

And then, as I reached for my wallet, she lunged at me. I dodged her attack, but she was close. I had to get away.

I ran as fast as I could, but she was close behind. She screamed, ""CHRIS, HELP ME!""

I ran to the nearest park ranger station and flagged down a ranger. The ranger chased the woman away, and I was able to breathe a sigh of relief.

But I was shaken. I had been stalked, threatened, and put through a lot of emotional distress. I was grateful to the ranger for his help, and I vowed to never go jogging alone again."
"When I died, I was sent to this realm between the Heavens and the Earth. Little did I know, the first guest I would meet would be Satan himself: 
 
 `` Here just take it with you!'' the devil said to me. He had desperation in his eyes, it was almost a plea for help. 
 
 `` Wait, what???'' I asked the frantic arch-angel standing before me. Here before me, the Ruler of the Underworld, the man known in life for bartering souls for fortune... and he wanted to give me his? `` But... why?'' 
 
 `` Its simple really. Let me explain this to you, kid. God created man in his image. God being the mightiest, he created man on the purpose of being kind, generous, and good.'' I listened on to the Devil's tirade, wondering if this was all a lie or what to believe. ``... Do you think that God, the greatest being of creation, would let even a single one of his greatest creations come down here to the after life to spend eternity with someone expelled from Paradise???'' 
 
 It made sense... in a sad way. This person who was once one of the calvary of the Lord unto the Heavens, looked sad and feeble. Not only that, he was alone... 
 
 `` I have led a sad existence. I was exalted from the greatest place of the afterlife. Ive been down here for Eons wondering when he would take me back into his doors. I have no right asking anything from anyone, but... Would you be willing to take my soul with you when you cross over?'' His eyes were filled with pain and loneliness. 
 
 I thought about it for a moment. If I went through with this would this cause some kind of turmoil in Heaven? I was raised in a Christian household, led a great and fantastic life, I helped others and forgave them when I knew what they had done was terrible and wrong. I feel bad for this man. I almost pity him... 
 
 Im going to help him. 
 
 `` Ok.'' I said. The arch-angel lifted his head with a genuine smile. 
 
 `` Really!? Thank you. Im sorry to put you into a mess like this, but Ive bore my sins entirely too long and I would like to ask the Lord myself for the chance of forgiveness. Thank you, thank you, thank you!'' 
 
 I was happy to help this person, even if he was the devil. If there was anything I had learned on my time being alive, is that we should forgive others and love one another. The world would've been a much better place if everyone worked together. 
 
 I walked into the light with Lucifer. Just to wind up in the same spot we were in before. I was puzzled. 
 
 `` Whats going on???'' i asked as I looked over at Lucifer, still smiling. 
 
 `` You passed.'' he said. 
 
 `` What do you mean?? Passed what?'' I was clueless to what he meant. 
 
 `` The final test. To get into Paradise. From all the things you learned, you learned the most important thing about being alive. Compassion.'' Lucifer said. 
 
 `` Wow... Thank you!'' still reeling from the confusion, tears began streaming from my eyes. I hugged the man who I had judged even on my time on Earth, without ever knowing him. This man, was a great man. 
 
 Lucifer then again grabbed my hand and began to lead me into the light this time. 
 
 `` Ready?'' he asked me. 
 
 `` I am now.'' I smiled back and wiped the last tear I would ever shed, and I am glad they were for this man.
"," Transform the essay into a series of hip-hop verses, focusing on rhythm, rhyme, and the expressive power of language to tell a story or convey a message.","(Verse 1)
Yo, I'm in the land between Heaven and Earth,
Meetin' Satan, ain't no time for mirth.
He's got desperation in his eyes,
A plea for help, disguised in disguise.

(Chorus)
Wait, what? I asked, the arch-angel in distress,
The devil's offer, I couldn't dismiss.
He said, ""It's simple, kid, listen to me,
God created man, for kindness and glee.""

(Verse 2)
This dude was once a Calvary man,
But now he's alone, stuck in this land.
No one to talk to, no one to hear,
Just his own demons, year after year.

(Chorus)
I thought about it, if I went through with this,
Would it cause a stir in Heaven's abyss?
I felt bad for him, I almost cried,
But I knew I had to help, I couldn't deny.

(Bridge)
I said, ""Ok,"" and the arch-angel smiled,
A genuine smile, like a ray of light in the wild.
I'm going to help him, no matter the cost,
Give him a chance to find solace and strength in the frost.

(Chorus)
I'm going to help him, my soul on the line,
To show him that even in the darkest times,
Hope can prevail, and a new future can start,
The devil's offer, I'm not willing to partake in the heart."
"`` You keep speaking about it as if it's human!'' 
 John's hand was trembling, but he finally let the barrel fall. I let him go. 
 `` Yes. Look around. It's not that they caused this mayhem. Our... people had equal input.'' 
 The metal face of the girl never shown any emotion, but the projected light in her eyes squinted a little. She was missing an arm and feet, half of her chest blown by some heavy-caliber weapon. Wall behind her was intact, so obviously she was still able to move. 
 `` And, in our situation, she may actually prove useful.'' 
 Two of us were last survivors, now. The trip to the zone, started as military mission, but the team was n't from military background. They did the basic training to keep up, but it was NOT ENOUGH. At least the eggheads lived long enough to carry out the main task. Now, we had to go back. 
 `` Ok, little one, I am absolutely out of binary translator devices, so can you speak or articulate?'' 
 Her eyes squinted more. 
 `` Look, we have been to the generator. We want to stop this madness, and we have actually means to do it. You can try to help us, and possibly get some of your finish restored behind the barrier, or lay here down. I know you have independent power source, because you'd be already dead. So?'' 
 `` Ok, I can talk. What do you want?'' 
 Her voice was surprisingly sweet. Like a little girl. The Machines were ignorant in the emotional area, and AI built ones preferred steady, metallic voice, that differentiated pitch only for humans to tell them apart. So she was human made. Possibly as a replacement of someones child? Independent power backed it up. 
 `` We want to get near the barrier, without falling to death. I'm sure you have scouted the area, and I'd love you to lead us there.'' 
 She actually shrugged. Wow. 
 `` Fine'' 
 Then, she rose. The rubble she was partially covered with, fell off of her. Dear God, she had full genitals modeled. She was a sex-bot! You sick fucks... If it was n't for the mutual bombings and actual survival of human race at stake, AI really should decide what robots are made. John's face shown similar disgust as mine, that I found surprising. 
 
 We passed the ruined commercial district, with tens of collapsed skyscrapers, and stumps of hundreds more. Fires has long went out, bet smell did n't. Steel and concrete was everywhere, in fine dust, mixed with soot, and I was sure, part of it came form burning *human flesh*. All with very fine particles that covered everything, including airways, damn. We roamed through the rubble, nearing the faint yellow glimmer of the barrier. Its flickering contained the AI control, and made the war possible in the first place. Humans can easily get through it, remotely controlled bots - not so much. We were getting close, but there was one obstacle on front of us - the drop. the city was build on raised bedrock, as we approached the chasm, it became evident, that climbing gear will be needed also on way down. And keen eyes that can see the sentinels. 
 `` So, girl, time to work for your prize. Can you guide us down?'' 
 `` Yes, I can, and I will. Why, again, am I helping you?'' 
 `` Because we have actual repair fab in our target outpost. You will be whole again... if you wish, that is.'' 
 `` And what will I do, when I'm whole? Go back to that dead, pervert, as you say?'' 
 `` You have independent AI branch in you. You're as self contained as a human. You can choose whatever you want then. No obligations, just like that.'' 
 Her eyes squinted again. The level of her emotional responses was alarmingly high, but then, someone paid A LOT of money for her to come to existence. She was apparently judging us both, but still could n't do it properly, since John and I rarely talked. She shrugged her arms again, and went down the slope to the chasm. 
 
 She was good. She carefully scouted the area, while unnaturally strolling on her one shorten leg, but she adapted, and shown no signs of loosing balance. I started wonder, how big of a threat she could become if I had to take her down. Her keen senses and IR vision definitely helped us avoid all the guards. Sentinels could hover for a time, but it made rather loud noise, so flying drones were n't much a threat. Walking ones, until slipping on sand and rocks, were deadly silent. She still managed to fool them, nearly loosing us. 
 
 `` You trust it, boss?'' 
 `` Her. Yes. Do n't ask, I have a hunch. She is definitely sick tired of what she was seeing.'' 
 `` But IT was...'' 
 `` Shhh... does n't matter. She has complete AI matrix built in. And she is definitely on the verge of solid PTSD. That we took her shook her enough to get moving. And she seems to be unaffected by General AI rampage, she may prove invaluable to rebuilding population of normal robots. Her mind may be precious.'' 
 `` If you say... but look how it moves, like an assassin! That ass flows!'' 
 `` For fucks sake, John, she was a friggin' sex doll! Of course she have fluid motion, it's what turns men on! Now shut up and let's go!'' 
 
 We arrived at the barrier near the sunset. Long shadows were like set in stone, as everything was motionless. Behind the barrier jungle started, but now it was silent too. Every creature was waiting for the ball of fire to disappear. 
 We strolled to the barrier and stopped. John dropped his ear, and started mounting a dog-sized directly in the barrier. 
 `` What is THAT?'' 
 `` That is, my sweet girl, a device that will allows us to push AI core through the barrier without frying it.'' 
 `` Uh, okay.'' 
 She moved closer, to look in curiosity. 
 `` Okay boss, it's ready, gim me the core.... UGH!''
"," Rewrite the text as a fairy tale, complete with moral lessons, magical elements, and archetypal characters.","In a distant land, where the boundaries of reality met the realm of the extraordinary, there lived a courageous warrior named John. One fateful day, as he embarked on a perilous journey to a mysterious zone, he encountered a captivating figure whose life had been intertwined with an unspeakable tragedy.

The girl, known for her unwavering strength and resilience, had lost her arm and feet, a testament to the brutality of the conflict that had consumed her. With a stoic expression, she stood tall, her eyes shining with determination. As John reached out to offer his assistance, he was met with a mixture of confusion and gratitude.

The girl's voice, as sweet as a bird's song, carried a hint of longing and desperation. She revealed her willingness to help, offering her knowledge of the area and her ability to guide them closer to the barrier that stood between them and salvation. With a shrug, she agreed to lead the way, her unwavering resolve guiding their path.

As they ventured deeper into the treacherous zone, they faced daunting obstacles and overcame seemingly insurmountable challenges. The girl's agility and quick wits enabled them to overcome the obstacles that lay in their path, her presence serving as a beacon of hope amidst the chaos.

Through their arduous journey, John and the girl forged a bond, one that transcended the boundaries of time and circumstance. They realized that even in the darkest of times, the human spirit has the capacity to triumph over adversity.

In the end, as they emerged from the zone, the girl stood tall, her wounds a testament to her resilience. With a smile on her face, she embraced John, her eyes reflecting the gratitude that filled her heart.

The moral of this tale is profound. It teaches us that even in the face of adversity, the human spirit has the ability to persevere and overcome. It also reminds us of the importance of compassion and the power of human connection.

The girl's journey is a reminder that we all have the potential to make a positive impact on the world, regardless of our circumstances. Her story serves as a testament to the enduring power of resilience and the transformative force of human kindness."
"It's frustrating to only have one of something. 
 
 It can be anything; a toy, a trophy, a marketable skill. When you've got one tool, you learn to solve every problem with it. For my village, that *one thing* was coal. We mined it, we sold it, we carved it into jewelry. We bought what we could not make with coins caked in black dust. I can recall even now the days that father brought me to the market with him. I remember one merchant in particular, his eyebrow raised in disdain as our hard-earned money stained his silk gloves. He was too good for us, but not too good for our money. But we are our money. We are our trade. My people have eaten and breathed coal dust for generations. The road to and from the mines is paved in onyx footprints. 
 
 Well, it was. 
 
 There was a collapse, and now there is no coal. There is no tool through which we may earn respect, no resource we have to offer the world. That is why I am here. I did not grow up with black lungs and bent back. I am young, and though I am hungry, I am strong. I was honored to be chosen, I suppose. 
 
 I can not help but wonder, as I walk through this valley with torch in hand, if this is a fool's errand. No one has prayed or made an offering in Death's Holler in an unrecorded number of years. I raise the flame higher to observe the barren walls around me once again. There is nothing at eye level. The valley's namesake instead lies hundreds of feet above me. Skeletons the size of giants have been carved directly into the walls. I can not tell if their empty eye sockets hold hope or resentment. They do the job of imposition well and I begin to feel unease at the thought that I am the first in decades to visit with serious intent. I reassure myself with the thought that a forgotten god is a desperate one. How vengeful could they afford to be? 
 
 Hours pass before I reach the end. The stone cadavers do not end, but not all of them look down in disapproval. Many are carves so as to be looking off into the distance, or with head bowed in prayer. Even if they are nothing more than statues, I am glad that their gaze is directed elsewhere. My own eyes are focused on the clearing before me. 
 
 The path ends in something of a cave. Unlike the path preceding it, long burnt-out torches line the walls. It is wider here, enough for a ceremony and a crowd of onlookers, although I see no benches or chairs. What fills the space instead is an alter, and some distance back, a stone chair, elevated much like a throne. Slumped in the `` throne'' is a skeleton, but a real one. The bones visible from underneath its robes are dusty and yellow. The fingers look as though they might to the ground, were they not clasped tightly around the edge of the throne's armrests. I walk over to the corpse to get a closer look. 
 
 I recognize its attire from Grandmother's books. She used to read me the stories of our people before we discovered the mines. She would tell me stories of my ancestors the death worshipers, and the ritual sacrifices they would make. Then Father would wheeze from the other room that *he* was the one making sacrifices now. I smile at the thought until I remember the rest. Grandmother used to say that when times were hard, and no lives could be spared, people would offer their own life in exchange for the gods' help. *Even a drop of blood will do... * 
 
 My eyes are drawn once again to the altar. It too is stone, any decoration long since rotted or worn away. The surface however, is indented like a bowl. The room takes on a more sinister feeling now. I can almost see smoke wafting from the torches on the wall. The skeletal priest looks as though he could leap from his seat at any moment. I look again at the altar. It feels almost... expectant. 
 
 `` Fine!'' I say, if only to hear my own voice. 
 
 I can spare a drop or two. I draw my knife from my belt and hold the blade to my wrist. My arms hover above the stone table, the sharp metal cold against my skin. I drag the edge quickly and lightly across my arm before rolling my eyes at how foolish I must look. Only a faint indentation appears, but I feel a slight burning sensation. I use my fingers to stretch the meager wound open until a line of red appears. I squeeze until I think there is enough. I turn my arm over, waiting nervously. I shake my arm as the bead forms, and eventually I am successful. A single red drop lands silently in the basin. I stare at it, the maroon liquid barely visible in the low lighting. I let out the breath I did n't realize I was holding and shake my head at my own foolishness. I stare at my arm, wondering if we are truly so desperate, only to have my thoughts interrupted by the hairs on the back of my neck. My attention turns to the skeleton on the throne. It has n't moved, but I suddenly feel uneasy at the thought of not having it in my sight. Then, a voice appears in my head, this time not my own. 
 
 *My boy, I'm going to need more than that. *
"," Infuse the essay with the lyrical and profound voice of Maya Angelou, reflecting on human dignity and resilience.","It's frustrating to have only one of something,
A precious gift, a token of grace,
A tool to harness, a weapon of might,
And when you've got one, you learn to shine.

For my village, the one thing we had was coal,
A resource that bound us, made us whole,
We mined it, sold it, carved it into art,
And through its power, we played our part.

I recall the days when father took me to the market,
And the merchant's disdain, a sight that sparked
A fire within me, a resolve to rise,
To break free from this oppressive guise.

But fate took a cruel turn, and the coal was gone,
Leaving us with nothing, a hollow song,
Yet through the darkness, I emerged,
Young, resilient, and full of surge.

I am here to defy the odds, to bring light,
To honor the legacy of those who fought,
For every human deserves to be treated with grace,
And I am determined to leave a lasting trace.

As I walk through this barren valley,
I raise my torch high, a symbol of my plight,
The valley's name echoes in my mind,
A testament to the past, a glimpse of time.

The stone cadavers line my path,
But I find solace in their silent wrath,
For I know that oblivion is a universal truth,
And in the face of adversity, strength can bloom."

"On September 14, 1994, a mugging went badly for everyone involved. In the ensuing chaos, a gun went off, killing a passing cyclist. 
 
 The cyclist was engaged to a woman named Diana Gaines. Upon losing her fiancé, Diana slipped into a deep depression. Because she was so consumed with grief, she lost her job as a kindergarten teacher and took a part-time job as secretary at a pharmacy. As consumed with grief as she was, her job was not done well. One day, as she slumbered at her post, men came in and stole a lot of very expensive medications. 
 
 Diana lost her job, and the men gained a livelihood that lasted them several months. In February of 1995, one of the purchasers of some of the drugs was unhappy with the shipment, and was cheated out of several tens of thousands of dollars. 
 
 The man, Güero Rivera, took out his frustration on his 13-year-old son that night, breaking both of his legs. 
 
 Ashamed of what he had done, he did not seek medical help, and the boy spent months in pain before his legs healed awkwardly and gruesomely twisted. 
 
 The boy left the state and became a waiter far from home, at a small restaurant that did n't mind that his gait was not smooth and that he took several minutes to cross a room. 
 
 One night as he worked, many years later, he bumped the very edge of a table as he passed, just enough to upset the glass of water on its surface and spill its content into the lap of one of the customers. 
 
 The occupants of the table were two high schoolers, on their very first date. 17-year-old Bryan Tate, with his perfectly-styled hair, wearing a borrowed pair of loafers because his sneakers were ripping at the seams. 16-year-old Marissa Davis, her hands shaking with anxiety, her bangs damp with a nervous sweat. 
 
 The glass of water spilled right into Bryan's lap, and Marissa, who had n't noticed the limping waiter passing by, blamed her shaking hands. 
 
 Red-faced, she rushed out of the restaurant without saying goodbye to Bryan, though he tried to console her. 
 
 Days passed, and she could n't bear to leave her room. Every time she tried, she was overwhelmed with waves of shame and regret and embarrassment until it buried her, and she rushed instead to nestle in her bed and bury herself in the Internet. 
 
 And there, in her room, she stayed. Because of the bullet.
"," Present the essay in the style of existentialist philosophy, questioning the nature of existence, freedom, and choice.","The tapestry of existence unfolds through the intricate dance of freedom and choice, yet it is interwoven with the inescapable threads of fate and the capricious nature of chance. Each moment presents a crossroads, a point of intersection where the interplay of these forces orchestrates a symphony of experiences.

The incident that unfolded on September 14, 1994, serves as a testament to the profound impact of these enigmatic forces. The tragic confluence of events painted a canvas of despair, heartbreak, and suffering. From the untimely demise of a cyclist to the cascading effect of grief that consumed Diana Gaines, the domino effect of fate intertwined with human choices, creating a symphony of tragedy.

Gaines' loss of her job and the subsequent theft of medications plunged her into a deep abyss of grief. Her job, once a source of purpose and fulfillment, was ripped away, leaving behind only an abyss of emptiness. The stolen medications, a tangible manifestation of her loss, symbolized the helplessness and injustice of her situation.

The ripple effects of her grief reverberated far beyond her own well-being. It touched the lives of those who came into contact with her, leaving an indelible mark on their hearts. One of the purchasers of the stolen medications, Güero Rivera, expressed his frustration and anger by taking out his anger on his son, Güero Rivera Jr. The boy's broken legs, a physical manifestation of his father's anger, symbolized the devastating power of unchecked emotions.

Rivera Jr.'s ordeal, marked by physical pain and emotional anguish, taught him valuable lessons about resilience and perseverance. Despite his limitations, he found solace in his work as a waiter, a testament to the human capacity for adaptation and adjustment.

The incident at the restaurant, years later, further illuminated the intricate interplay of fate and choice. The spilled glass of water, a symbol of life's unpredictability, landed squarely on the lap of a young high schooler, Bryan Tate. The blame for the mishap was placed squarely on Marissa Davis, whose trembling hands had caused the catastrophe. Yet, the incident served as a reminder of the fleeting nature of human control and the inevitability of accidents.

In this tapestry of existence, we are all actors playing our part, free to make choices that shape our own destinies. However, fate and chance often intervene, weaving intricate patterns of suffering, joy, and resilience. The question of why and the meaning of our existence remain unanswered, yet the journey itself, imbued with both freedom and constraint, is an existential tapestry we all weave."
"I always reach for the bedpost after turning out the light. If I do n't do this, I walk *into* the bedpost, and smack my knee on the bottom or my arm on the top. That second or so, flailing in the dark until I find it, is like being untethered in a sea of darkness; some nights I overshoot and end up cursing and freshly bruised, some nights I find it with guided accuracy. 
 
 Tonight, it is n't there. I pause with one hand back toward the light-switch, and one out in front of me, wondering if I'm about to overshoot completely and walk smack into the wardrobe. I furrow my brow in annoyance, reminding myself for the millionth time to get a lamp. I walk forward another step, waving my arm carefully; *nothing's* there. 
 
 It's astonishing how quickly I've lost my bearings. It's not a large room. I backtrack for the wall and the light-switch, fully expecting to walk into the post now I've turned around… I take five steps and stop. It is n't possible to take five steps in this room without hitting *something*. 
 
 My eyes should have adjusted by now. It takes a while, which is why I do n't bother to wait, but even so… by now I should be able to make out the faint orange of the distant streetlight. I stand there, confused. Have I gone blind? I blink, twice, then lift my hand to my face. No, I can see, very faintly, a lighter shape. I turn around, which is a mistake, because I suddenly have no idea which way I'm facing; I was looking for the hallway, where the light from the router should be blinking its mellow but perceptible glow from the study doorway. Nothing, not a single variance in the darkness, unless I lift my hand to right in front of my eyes. 
 
 I obey a sudden instinct to stay low and small, and crouch, expecting my hands to find hardwood floor or wool rug. 
 
 Not hard-packed gravel and dirt, like a country lane. 
 
 Am I outside then? My mind churns, trying to explain how I got outside from my bedroom doorway. A fugue, a seizure, sleep-walking. Except, this is n't *my* outside. There are security lamps and a few streetlights and the two-thirds moon that had already been up when I finished my evening meal. 
 
 No, I'm not outside. I ca n't explain how I know, except there's no breeze on my face, no sensation of endlessness above me. I'm in a room with a hardpan floor and no light. The breath goes out of me as I realise there is no explanation for this. 
 
 I crawl forwards, slowly, constantly expecting to crash into something; a wall, a piece of furniture, maybe something industrial… I might not be outside, but this space is *big*, the stifling darkness notwithstanding. Nothing gleams or glints, nothing makes any noise, except my breathing which is fast and ragged. Just hearing it makes the fear worse. I stay on the ground, thankful that I wore my sweat pants and t-shirt to bed, and that I shuffled back into my sneakers just to walk back from the bathroom. 
 
 I crawl like this, my knees jabbed and numbed by loose flecks of gravel, my hands alternately reaching forwards and propelling me one stuttering lunge at a time into an unknowable darkness. 
 
 And then I feel something. My hand hits fabric, then something unyielding under it; I almost shriek, and yank my hand back to cover my mouth. Surprise, that's all. I wait until I'm sure I'm not going to have a heart attack, and then tentatively reach back out… fabric, yes, like rough linen or sacking. And under it… I moan, despite wanting to be as quiet as possible. Under the fabric, a leg. Next to it, another. Standing perfectly still, unvoiced. 
 
 Someone's there.
"," Recast the essay as a tale from the American Wild West, including vernacular speech, descriptions of the rugged landscape, and frontier challenges.","The sun beat down on my back like a hot potato on a griddle, and my boots sank deep into the grit of the desert trail. The wind whipped my hair around me, and the sand danced in my eyes. I was riding the wind, out on the Great Plains, and the only sound was the hum of my horse's hooves and the distant cry of a coyote.

But fate took a cruel hand and tossed me from my horse, leaving me sprawled on the sand. I looked around, dazed and confused. The desert stretched before me like an endless ocean, and the sky was vast and star-studded. I felt like I was in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but the wind and the desert for company.

I tried to get my bearings, but the desert was a cruel and unforgiving place. The sand shifted beneath me, and the wind blew sand in my eyes and mouth. I stumbled and stumbled, trying to find a landmark, but there was nothing. I felt like I was walking through a labyrinth of sand, and I was lost.

Finally, I stumbled upon a rock formation that looked like a giant arch. I climbed up and took a breath of relief. I was safe, for now. I looked around and took in the beauty of the desert. The sun was setting, and the sky was ablaze with color. I felt like I was in a dream, and I was grateful to be alive.

As the sun began to dip behind the mountains, I rode back to my camp. I was exhausted, but I was also happy. I had survived the desert, and I had come to appreciate the beauty of the wild."
"I promised I would never abandon her. With tears in her eyes and scars on her arms, she would blame me. I was the reason she was depressed. I was the reason she lost all her friends. I was the reason she felt the need to harm herself. 
 
 You know what her definition of abandonment was? Not messaging her on Facebook for three whole days. That's all it took. Three days, and she tells me that she no longer wants to be friends anymore. 
 
 Fine. That is honestly the way it should be. We would both be better off not not having each other in our lives. We were free. 
 
 Or so I thought. 
 
 It was all just a passive-aggressive, manipulative trick. Once again, I was the bad guy for not trying to get her to forgive me. How could I be so insensitive to her feelings? I'm a horrible person, and she's the only one who will forgive me. Not my sister, not my best friend, not my parents. I'm nothing without her. 
 
 So I did what I though was right: I abandoned her.

Her definition of abandonment was not my not messaging her on Facebook for three whole days. To her, it was the end of the world. I understand that she has gone through a lot, and I am sorry for my part in it. However, I am not going to let her manipulate me into feeling guilty. I was not the cause of her depression, and I am not the only one who can help her.

"The soft chime of a struck wine glass faded beyond audible levels leaving me with a silent room. It was time for my speech.

 `` I remember her as a baby, always trying to escape from her cot to cause trouble! She never once let me get away with being an inattentive parent - much to my chagrin - but she also never failed to light up my life with her laughter and her charm. Even during the darkest of days she was always the one who could put a smile on my face and keep me going. Even now, as I must face the prospect that I might no longer be the most important man in her life, she is filling me with joy and with hope.'' 
 
 I sigh, mostly for dramatic effect, but also with the certainty that my speech was meant to be very short. The Patrons did n't want a sob story - they wanted - well nobody knew.

 `` All you need to know is that you have to make sure the kid has a charmed life. He was brought into this world, god help us, so that The Patrons could watch him die at his happiest moment. Get him there.''

""In many ways, I have been the most blessed of men,"" I declared, my voice resonating with the room. ""Ariadne, my beloved daughter, is the most wonderful gift I have been bestowed with. She is kind, attentive, and nothing like her mother.""

A wave of applause and a smattering of giggles greeted my tribute. I recalled her infantile days, the incessant attempts to escape her cot, and the unwavering determination to fill my life with laughter and charm. Even during the darkest of times, she had been the beacon of joy and resilience. As I contemplated the potential departure from the center of her universe, I felt an abundance of joy and hope.

A sigh, dramatic yet sincere, escaped me. The Patrons, a discerning audience, were not seeking a tale of woe but a celebration of love and resilience. I paid tribute to the exceptional man I had found for my daughter, a man of unwavering strength and unwavering compassion.

With a mixture of anticipation and dread, I introduced the groom. ""I first met this young man when I knew his father, back when we both served in the Ministry of Defence, and immediately knew that he would be a man who went places,"" I recounted. ""After his father passed, I took on the mantle of looking after him from afar, making sure that he always had a guardian angel by his side. So, imagine my surprise when he showed up with my daughter!""

The moment of truth had arrived. The tension in the air was palpable. I raised my glass in a toast, my heart filled with gratitude and anticipation. As the celebratory shot echoed through the hall, the world was shattered by a tragic event. Screams, chaos, and tragedy unfolded before my eyes. One life extinguished, a future shattered.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, I struggled to comprehend the situation. ""What do you mean a tribute?"" I asked, my voice laced with disbelief and despair. ""The government made certain promises, promises that will have to be acted on.""

The other man, tall, thin, and solemn, replied, ""The tragedy is beyond comprehension. We must find solace in the fact that her spirit will forever be alive.""

In that moment, I felt the weight of the world upon my shoulders. The tragedy had touched me deeply, and I knew I had to use my voice to advocate for change, to honor the memory of the deceased, and to bring solace to those affected."

 `` Like do you think he's a transvestite?'' He asks. 
 
 `` What no? That ca n't be. He's probably like a prostitute,'' says the Scarlett Twister. 
 
 `` No, what? That does n't make any sense. How would that... you're crazy. He's clearly a hand model,'' says the Red Badge of Carnage.

We are about to win. Well, I'm about to win. Sorry, gentlemen. Our great plan to team up is unnecessary unless we want to take him down together. But, if I were him, I would be on my way home. There still might be a chance, James.'' 
 
 I do some math in my head. Twenty minutes back to the apartment if I'm lucky. I swing down to my motorcycle and race home. I think of all the mistakes I made and how I would never forgive myself if something happened to them. I nearly get hit a dozen times, but I make it home in 12 minutes. Even my name, The Night Hunter, is reckless. I use my grappling hook to climb up to my apartment. I open the door on the deck and walk in. 
 
 The babysitter sleeps on the couch. I make sure that she is just sleeping, but I see her chest heave, up and down. I walk into my girls' room. The floor is covered in toys, and I step on one. I bite my tongue to keep from howling in pain. I examine both of them closely. I am relieved. They are safe here and uninjured. Then, it strikes me. Oh, no, it was a bluff. I lead them right to my family.

"A young, tall man is pacing along the almost deserted platform. Turning around whenever he feels like it. Ten steps one way, twenty the other, turning, 5 steps. 
 He looks at the sign, as he is watching the glowing 4 is replaced by a bright 3. He turns his head, averting his gaze. 
 
 A couple is leaning against the wall on the far end of the platform, talking in hushed voices, giggling quietly. An old, disheveled looking man is staring intently at the wall, looking at his reflection in the white tiles barely an arms reach away, looking, without seeing. 
 Suddenly he turns. Looking at the display `` 3 minutes''. He stumbles along the wall, staying as far away from tracks as he can leaning into the slightly curved wall. 
 
 The young man sees the old coming towards him and tries to look at nothing in particular. 
 
 A large grey camera is looking down the platform, its never sleeping eye looking towards the few passengers that are still out on a Tuesday evening. The young man turns, looking at the camera. Are there any others, he wonders. 
 He sees the old man, creeping closer by the second. 
 
 The old man raises his head, barley seeing the blurred letters on the train indicator. Still 2 minutes. 
 
 The young mans eyes are wandering, then his head turns towards a small black dome on the ceiling. The red indicator light comes on. Off, on, he is staring intently, off, on. The blinking light is reflected in the tiled ceiling above. 
 
 Barely 10 meters separate both the young and the old man. Their eyes meet. 
 
 The neon lights are flickering as the unmistakable brush of air of the oncoming train blows a gum packaging and an abandoned fast food bag across the dirty platform tiles. The young man breaks away almost instantly, his eyes coming to rest instead on a garbage bin to his right. 
 
 Stumbling the old man works his way forward, he has a goal in mind. 
 
 One minute. 
 
 The young man is checking his pockets, wallet, phone, key, everything in place? Yes, everything is where it should be. Just one more minute, then he can sink into the trains cushioned seats. 
 
 The old man is not what he used to be, once he was young, and good looking. There is one thing they ca n't take from him, that one release. I turn my head, the couple almost out of sight. I am old, but I can still feel the rush coming. The adrenaline that kicks in right before, even if I do this for the hundredths time. 
 
 I ca n't quite hear the train yet but I know from the wind that it is time. 
 I move faster then I did before, looking at the grey camra as it is turning away. Eyes now focused on what is in front of me. 
 
 The noise of the train is now audible, growing louder. The young boy, barley even a man, is walking towards the tracks, surely awaiting the warmth of the carriage. 
 The piece of packaging is moving in the trains wind, gaining in speed, as am I, unleashing the last bit of effort my muscles are capable of as I check one last time. The blinking light above, on, off, on, off, off, off, staying off. It is time, I am running. 
 
 The young man hears me, turning around, but as he looks at me it is already too late. All of my weight is driving him of the platform. My elbow in his rib cage, that terrible strength that comes with the excitement driving me forwards, never relinquishing. 
 
 He is fighting for his balance but he ca n't win. He is already falling as the lights of the train start illuminating the tracks below us. 
 
 I am running, faster then I ever thought myself capable of, but this is what it does, the thrill. 
 The thrill of killing, in the open, yet hidden. As I round the corner I see the camera turning back, now watching the grizzling scene that plays out before it. The woman screaming, a man hammering the red emergency button. 
 A slimy rest of someone who might have once been love lying down in the tracks, the train above. 
 
 People will tell you that whoever murders someone in public will always get caught, after all, big brother is watching. But when big brother turns a blind eye on you the impossible becomes easy, and my older brother happens to like me. A lot!

The glow of the number four fades, replaced by the brilliance of the number three, a fleeting glimpse into the journey that lies ahead. The young man's head spins, his gaze searching for solace in the abstract.

A couple whispers secrets, their laughter reverberates through the air, a melody intertwined with the rhythm of the platform. An old man gazes at his reflection, the mirror mirroring the patterns etched upon his worn face. In a sudden movement, he turns, his eyes searching for the display, the clock ticking mercilessly. Stumbling along the wall, he finds respite, his gaze fixed on the ceiling tiles, mirroring the rhythmic dance of the train platform.

The young man's eyes wander, his head turns, as if seeking answers in the depths of the abyss. He sees the old man creeping closer, his body trembling, his purpose evident. The old man raises his head, his eyes struggling to see through the blur of the oncoming train. As the clock ticks down, the young man's mind is consumed by the rhythmic dance of his own thoughts.

The air is thick with the scent of fast food and discarded gum wrappers, a testament to the transient nature of life. The train roars into view, its powerful engine shaking the platform. The young man breaks away, his eyes searching for a garbage bin, his body mirroring the movement of the train. The old man stumbles forward, his purpose guiding him, his steps deliberate.

One minute remains. The young man checks his pockets, his wallet, his phone, his keys, ensuring that everything is in place. With a sigh, he turns back to the old man, his gaze meeting the old man's. The neon lights flicker, reflecting the rhythmic dance of the train as it whisks away the old man, leaving the young man alone on the platform."
"The Longship, drawn high against the gravel beach, was the last of the offending settlement to be put to the torch. The shipwright who had carefully carved the dragon's head might have appreciated the irony of its fiery death, were his own fate not so similar. As the flames stretched up to devour the sails, the burst of orange light gave the dragon's wooden eyes a glimpse of it's children's fate. 
 
 The raiders, a band of 30 or so smallish creatures that their enemies called `` halflings'', were mostly busy pulling any useful metals out of the ashes. Torching the buildings fast, while not optimal for maximizing spoils, did vastly reduce the number of enemies that the fat-footed fey-folk had to battle. The smell of charred meat hung over the site, overpowering but for the equally abundant scent of charred wood. 
 
 As the grisly scene smouldered away, two of the larger fey-folk, or `` Elves'' as they were commonly known, calmly rode into the scene on horseback. Stubby halfling arms raised respectful hands to chubby halfling faces as the pair passed. In the gloom of the evening light, the two inspected the work of their smaller kin, as well as the ruins of the invaders. 
 
 The younger of the two elves heard little of his master's talk. His eyes fixed on the architecture of their enemies while his mind asked how such a small ship could hold so MANY of them. The droning speech of tactics and strategies was only the background music for his wonderment. 
 
 For a moment, the elder elf stopped talking, and her companion scarcely noticed as a halfling spoke up from the ground. It was only upon her order of `` slaughter them'' that his interest was piqued. He swiveled in his saddle to behold the halfling commander with his charge of prisoners, all of them even smaller than their captor. 
 
 It took his mind a moment to process it. `` Children.'' he said, to nobody in particular. Turning again in his saddle, `` We're killing the children!?'' he asked his master more pointedly. 
 
 The older elf cocked her head to the side at her apprentice, bemused by his sudden accusation. `` Of course. These ARE humans we're dealing with.'' Dismissing the interjection, she turned to the halfling again. `` Make it fast.'' 
 
 The younger elf's jaw hung wide for a moment as the guards led the frightened youths to a quiet place. `` I've told you a hundred times.'' The master spoke, as though sensing the young elf's horror. `` All humans encountered on the mainland must be killed. No exceptions.'' 
 
 `` Certainly this is n't necessary. Can they not be adopted? Sold as slaves, even? Must we end their innocent lives? 
 
 `` No human is born innocent. Not even their Gods think so, or so I have heard. They are a blight upon this Earth that must be removed, no different from plague or rot.'' 
 
 `` They can not be taught our ways? To slaughter them is so wasteful, at the very least! And would n't friendly humans be useful to us?'' 
 
 `` Are friendly termites useful? Or rats? The humans are not dangerous for want of sophistication.'' The Master waved a hand, emphasizing the works of the freshly razed settlement, a gesture that would have no doubt been more poignant if they were still standing. `` They are simply too hungry.'' 
 
 `` And? Are our children not hungry before we discipline them? Do they wail and throw fits? How different can they be?'' 
 
 The two hundred or so years that the master had over her apprentice seemed to widen by a decade or two. At 87, he would not have a family for at least half a century, and while his facts about child-rearing were sound, his naivete struck his master like a dull hammer. 
 
 `` The humans are not simply hungry for food, though that appetite is substantial enough...'' she said, casting a pointed glance at the vast midden of shells and fishbones that piled against the southern edge of the village. 
 
 She continued `` Hunger is all they ever know. It is their hunger for land that drives them across the sea. It is their hunger for power that brings them into conflict with us. And their hunger for the flesh, well, that is most terrifying of them all.'' 
 
 `` That ship,'' she said, pointing at the flaming wreck adorned with the charred and mangled visage of a dragon, `` carried perhaps two score of them. In two decades it grew into the settlement you see here. Those children did not ARRIVE here. They were BORN here.'' 
 
 The apprentice processed this for a moment. `` They can breed so quickly? Gods, how close are these to reproducing?'' 
 
 `` Another 5 winters at most. The humans can double the size of their settlements in a decade. That is why we lost the Southern continent in the First war.'' 
 
 `` How many of these settlements must exist, then? Surely we do not know all of them?'' 
 
 `` We can not say. The continent is vast, but each year brings more Men across the Gray Sea. These were merely settlers, trying to survive. Can you imagine what world happen if they mounted another invasion? We can not let any of them survive, lest the survivors tell of us as lenient or weak.'' 
 
 `` But they have treaties with us. Pacts since the war. It has not even been a hundred years!'' 
 
 `` A blink of an eye to you and me. But it's eternity, I'm told, for them. What I've heard of the Southern continent is unfathomable. They say that the humans lose more than half of their children, yet every inch of habitable land is spoken for. I've heard rumors that their rulers must commit genocide merely to make breathing room. When the humans decide they want this land, they'll do the same to us.'' 
 
 `` So we kill them first...'' 
 
 `` So we kill them first.'' 
 
 The screams of the human children died slowly wIth the winter sun. The fires burned long into the night, long after the host of fey-folk had departed. By morning's light, little remained besides the ashes. The tide took away the remains of the Longship, and the dragon's head, now a blackened log, rolled about in the waves. The charcoal pits of its eyes gazed forlornly at the land it had helped to invade, as it bobbed up and down in the surf that would carry the inevitable conquerors to victory.
"," Write with the artistic flair and depth of a Renaissance painter, rich in visual detail.","The Longship, cast against the gravelly shore, was the final victim to the fiery dance of destruction. Its architect, a craftsman of intricate dragon heads, might have found solace in the irony of its demise, were it not for his own impending fate. As flames consumed the sails, a burst of orange light illuminated the dragon's eyes, mirroring the fate of its young.

The raiders, a band of diminutive creatures commonly referred to as ""halflings,"" were primarily preoccupied with extracting valuable metals from the smoldering ruins. While the swiftness of their fire had decimated many enemy structures, it had come at the cost of reduced spoils. The acrid aroma of charred meat lingered in the air, overpowered only by the potent scent of charred wood.

As the smoldering embers subsided, two imposing figures rode into the aftermath of the carnage. Stubby halfling arms extended in greeting, they approached the ruins with a solemn grace. Their eyes scanned the carnage, their hearts etched with compassion.

The younger elf, consumed by awe, fixated on the intricate architecture of the enemy. His mind marveled at the colossal scale of the ship, imagining the numerous souls that had inhabited its wooden halls. The elder elf, mindful of her companion's distress, paused her speech and listened intently to the halfling's plea.

In a moment of reflection, the elder elf contemplated the plight of the innocent children. Her voice softened, she uttered, ""Children,"" echoing through the ruins. Her companion's bewilderment was evident. ""We're killing the children!?"" he exclaimed, his voice filled with despair.

The elder elf nodded, her eyes filled with determination. ""Slaughter them,"" she commanded. It was a moment of intense contemplation, a crossroads between cruelty and compassion. As the blades glinting in the twilight, the elf's words carried the weight of destiny, forever etched in the annals of time."
"`` I've gotten myself into quite a pickle,'' my client told me, `` So I'm trying to get rid of some loose ends.'' 
 
 I simply assumed he did some crime, got away, and did n't want his partners to rat him out. I've gotten these kinds of jobs before. Standard. Simple. Kill some poor asshole that got himself into a sticky situation. 
 
 Holy shit, was I wrong. 
 
 I went to the address disclosed for me. I found myself standing in front of small house, the wooden shutters decaying from time. The stairs on the porch looked like they were about to crumble if I coughed on them. For all I cared, the house could have been a pile of rocks, as long as I still got paid. 
 
 The instructions I were given dictated me to knock on the door and follow the person that answered it. So I did. A pale man with a well-tailored suit silently greeted me into the abode. He simply began walking and I followed after closing the door behind me. I was alert, on edge, ready to take on my job. 
 My instructions went on to detail how the man would lead me into a basement, where I was to receive further orders. I went downstairs. I thought I was prepared for whatever sight would greet me. What I saw then, I still ca n't explain today. It was just a job. 
 
 I found my client. Twice, in fact. At once. I instantly recognized his face from the news; he was a suspect in a bank robbery, and right now, he seemed pretty fucking guilty. He stood in the dingy basement, a huge duffle bag of what I assumed was cash behind him, and next to a chair with a restrained man. The man was an exact copy of him. Spot on, the beard, the hair cut, the small mole on his left cheek. 
 
 `` Hi,'' the'him' standing up said, `` I'm sure you have a lot of questions.'' 
 
 I did, but that was unprofessional. I shook my head in response. I just wanted to get this weird shit over with. `` Good,'' he said, `` I need you to kill me. THIS me!'' He quickly corrected. 
 
 He continued, `` Yeah, I'm sure you recognize me. I just pulled off a heist. I needed to be in two places at once, so I made a clone.'' 
 
 I only thought how. 
 
 `` I'm pretty scientifically talented,'' he said in reply to my confused expression, `` I want you to kill him. It. Me, whatever the fuck. I'm tying up loose ends.'' 
 
 `` Why would you hire a hit man to do it?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Look man I'm a bank robber, but not a murderer. Plus he looks just like me! Think you'd be able to do the same? Just do the job and I'll pay you, dude.'' 
 
 I looked at the clone sitting in the chair, tied up. He looked at me with tired, red eyes. His sorrowful expression. `` Do n't do it man,'' he said, `` He's lying. I remember everything in my life. I'm an actual person. *He's* the clone! Have some god damn morals!'' 
 
 `` I'm just doing a job,'' I replied. 
 
 `` I'll pay you too!'' He shouted back before being silenced by a punch to the face by the standing man. 
 
 The two started yelling back and forth. At me. At each other. I zoned out, closed my eyes. I blocked them out and drew my gun. 
 
 -- -- -- 
 
 The news was interesting the next day. `` BANK HEIST SUSPECTS FOUND! TWIN BROTHER ALSO INVOLVED! THREE BODIES AT SITE! MONEY NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!'' The headlines read. 
 
 I parked my new car at my new house. I still had some junk money left over. It would take a while for the rest to be laundered, but it would last me the rest of my life if I was smart about it. All my loose ends were tied and I covered my tracks. Some other poor bastard would be getting arested for what I did. After all, the event was just a job, and I still got paid in the end.
"," Write in the direct, authoritative tone of a no-nonsense military officer, with a focus on discipline.","The address I was given led me to a dilapidated house, the scent of decay clinging to the air. I found my client, a notorious bank robber, standing amidst a scene of carnage. It was a sight I still can't explain today.

I arrived at the address, a grim smile etched on my face. I knew I had gotten myself into a sticky situation, but I was determined to do my job. I found the man, his face a mirror image of the suspect in the news. He was calm, composed, and ready to make a deal.

He offered me a handshake, but I refused. I was not in the mood for pleasantries. He showed me the duffle bag, stuffed with cash, and pointed to the chair next to the restrained man. The air was thick with the stench of desperation and fear.

""Hi,"" he said, his voice dripping with honey. ""I'm sure you have a lot of questions.""

I did, but that was unprofessional. I shook my head in response. I just wanted to get this weird shit over with.

""Good,"" he said, his voice cracking. ""I need you to kill me. THIS me!"" He quickly corrected.

He continued, ""Yeah, I'm sure you recognize me. I just pulled off a few heists, and I'm not afraid to do it again.""

I stared at him, my mind reeling. I knew that I had to do something, but what? I couldn't just leave him there, not after he had offered me a deal. So, I did what any no-nonsense military officer would do. I put him in his place, and I made sure he never forgot me."
"`` Your seventh child is going to kill you,'' the witch said as I finished my drink with her. 
 
 `` Seventh?'' I asked. She nodded, and her tangled hair fell over her eyes. Margaret was an interesting character. She hung out around the bar and fancied herself a witch. 
 
 `` Yeah,'' she said, `` had a vision last night, sucks do n't it?'' 
 
 `` Well you are n't wrong there,'' I said, if I had children I'd be freaking out.'' 
 
 She looked from her glass and then to me, `` you do n't?'' 
 
 `` No, never found the lady.'' 
 
 `` Well if you do, just make sure you do n't have seven.'' 
 
 `` Will do Margaret.'' 
 
 Three years later Margaret and I were married. Despite her unusual views on pagan gods, she was wonderful and the love of my life. The more interesting part of her, though, was the fact that she was literally a witch. I could n't deny it once I saw the cauldron that could let her see anyone in the city at any time. 
 
 Three years and seven days later Margaret and I were sitting in planned parenthood. We did n't want to birth deadly children, but I'd fucked up. The visit was more about caution than coathangers, but it was still a visit. Which meant that I still saw Lisa. 
 
 Lisa was a blonde woman that I had n't met before this day. She walked up and swore that she knew me from somewhere. We had talked for a while before I put my glasses on and it clicked for her. I had been her sperm donor for her artificial insemination. I looked at her with wide eyes and then to Margaret. 
 
 `` How could you forget that you were a sperm donor?'' she asked as we walked back from planned parenthood. We were eating ice cream, I was a vanilla person, and she liked black licorice for its name. 
 
 `` It was n't a big deal at the time,'' I said, `` I did the shit for the twenty bucks and the cute girl at the counter.'' 
 
 `` You flirted with someone by whacking it in the room beside them?'' she asked. I still considered it flawless logic. She shook her head, `` we are going to the clinic and getting a list of your children.'' 
 
 `` I think that's against some privacy laws.'' 
 
 `` Being a witch should get me burned and you still love me,'' she said. Margaret too a lick of her ice cream and then bit into it. `` Do n't be a pansy about it, illegal is nothing.'' 
 
 `` All right,'' I said, and we went to the clinic. 
 
 Three spells later we had somehow managed to get all of the released information about my children. Most of them were names and some birth addresses, but we were told it was incomplete information. We did n't have days. 
 
 `` You have 42 children?'' Margaret asked as she looked over the paper. 
 
 `` Are you impressed?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Terrified,'' she answered, `` and you're a fucking idiot. Do we know who number seven is?'' 
 
 `` No birthdates, but they should n't be older than fifteen now anyway.'' 
 
 `` Fifteen is the perfect age for father killing!'' she said a little too loud in the middle of the street, `` your magic blood will be potent in them by then! Who know's what they will do?'' for the first time in my life I saw Margaret's eyes waver. 
 
 `` FATHER!'' a scream came from the other side of the street, `` I hope you are prepared! I am your first seventh child!'' I looked toward the voice and saw a little waif of a brunette carrying a sword, `` prepare for your reckoning!'' she screamed, and her sword went ablaze. Fuck. 
 
 `` We were n't done talking about this,'' Margaret said as she raised a hand. Within a second the girl tripped and fell. She ended up beside her sword and caught on fire. I watched in horror as she burned. 
 
 `` Do what you want father!'' she screamed while also screaming, `` when I die the eighth shall be seventh! One of us will drink your blood!'' she yelled before she stopped screaming. Death calmed her down. 
 
 `` Oh god dammit,'' Margaret said beside me, `` I only have so many luck curses, and I do n't think all of them are going to be stupid enough to have a flaming sword.'' 
 
 `` What are we going to do?'' I asked. 
 
 `` I have no idea,'' she said, `` but it's probably going to take years.''

"I was wondering the museum halls without clear direction — trying to think of a solution to a recent coding challenge — when I saw the stone. At first I walked past, but there was something about it that made me return, look once more. The symbols were unfamiliar, but their distribution, their balance meant something. Familiar structure, familiar code... and then it clicked — machine code! 
 
 If some symbols were numbers, and the others were commands — maybe add, subtract, the common ones, then I could read it. I could run it! It needed a bit of mapping work, but I had the time. An ancient tablet from thousands of years ago was definitely more exciting than a coding challenge. 
 
 It took me a week to finish. Most of the commands made sense — standard math — but one eluded me. It seemed useless — took two numbers, but did n't produce anything. After many tries, I have found a clue in one of the obscure coding challenges I solved years ago. Draw. Take the 2D coordinates, and mark them. 
 
 When run, the code was to produce an image. 
 
 As soon as I finished the interpreter, I ran it. The image appeared on my screen, moving as the code was executed. The image from thousands of years ago, a breakthrough, a new frontier. 
 
 Unfortunately it made no sense. 
 
 I have shown it to my friends, and to archaeologists, and no one knew what it was. `` It's not surprising `` said Hael, one of the archeologists `` as we know very little about that era. There is n't much left — for example, the paper you decoded was preserved only by bonding with stone in a very unlikely way. Your work is amazing nevertheless. We can only assume that image meant something once, but that meaning is lost now.'' 
 
 I knew the decoding was important by itself, but it was still a disappointment. That evening, I went to the balcony and looked at Earth, black and red in the sky. What secrets did it hold? 
 
 Behind me, on one of the screens, the tablet program was still running in a loop. 
 
 An image that would only make sense to someone thousands of years ago. An animal. An animated cat, moving its paw. Up then down. 
 
 Up then down.
"," Adapt the text to mimic the tone and style of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, often dark with moral lessons.","In a dim and winding museum hall, a lone traveler stumbled upon a stone tablet, its weathered surface whispering secrets from the distant past. Curiosity consumed the individual, and in a moment of revelation, the symbols etched on the stone unveiled their hidden meaning. Familiar patterns and obscure codes intertwined, igniting a spark of understanding.

As the symbols danced in the traveler's mind, a vision emerged. Numbers and commands danced harmoniously, revealing the intricate language of ancient code. With a mixture of patience and determination, the traveler deciphered the intricate patterns, piecing together the puzzle like a forgotten puzzle.

Yet, fate's cruel hand twisted the traveler's joy into despair. The image that materialized before their eyes was enigmatic, defying interpretation. No one, from archaeologists to scholars, could unravel its mystery. The once-promising tablet had yielded nothing but an abstract enigma, leaving the traveler with a sense of futility.

As the night cast long shadows upon the earth, the traveler stared at the vastness of the universe, contemplating the secrets that lay hidden within its celestial expanse. The stone tablet, a testament to the ingenuity of the past, stood as a symbol of the fleeting nature of knowledge and the enigmatic beauty of the unknown.

The traveler's journey ended on that night, but the stone tablet remained, a testament to their perseverance and the boundless potential of human understanding."
"Joe had had enough of Karen's shit. 
 
 Karen looked around frantically for somewhere to hide. 
 
 `` Kids, get in the pantry,'' she said in a quavering tone. 
 
 Davis and Cameron were n't fast enough. They watched as their mother's jaw was broken by an ex-marine they called `` Dad''. Blood and teeth hit the floor before she did. 
 
 Suddenly, something crashed through the window above the sink, and landed on the kitchen island. It was a large candy cane. It popped off just below the curved part. Joe, who was already stunned by what he had just done to his wife and mortified by the blood spattered faces of his adopted children, looked at the tube with mortal fear in his eyes. The kids, who had been staring at their mother quietly, walked into the pantry and closed the door. 
 
 Joe picked up the hollow candy cane and turned it upside down. A small scroll fell out, which he unrolled with shaky hands. 
 
 `` *I'm making a list and checking it twice. * 
 
 *I always find out who's naughty and nice. `` * 
 
 Joe shuddered with the sudden realization that his life would be over soon. He shook out the rest of the cane's contents. A lumpy Christmas present. 
 
 *'' To: Joey* 
 
 *From: Santa'' * 
 
 Joe ripped it open. Inside was his stocking from when he was a child. Coal spilled out onto the torn wrapping paper. The hair on the back of his neck stood up as the stocking burst into flames and churning black smoke filled the kitchen. 
 
 `` Kids.. Stay in the pantry.'' 
 
 He stepped over Karen's wasted frame. Her jaw was disfigured and her open mouth was leaking blood. Her eyes were still open. 
 
 The sound was faint at first, then began to grow louder and louder. 
 
 *'Jingle jingle jingle... Jingle jingle jingle...'* 
 
 There was a shotgun above the mantel. He made his way into the living room... 
 
 *'JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE'* 
 
 But it was too late. 
 
 ***CRASH!!! *** 
 
 Through the window looking out to the street to the left of the fireplace crashed the first reindeer, and seven more came a hundredth of a second later, knocking over furniture and bits of the wall along the way. They filed into the hallway at immense speed, staring at Joe with glowing red eyes that would light the darkest night. 
 
 ***BOOM*** 
 
 Santa's sleigh crumbled his living room wall. An out of tune guitar he got for Christmas on his 7th birthday was knocked over and crushed within a second, making a terrible sound. 
 
 There he was. A formidable man with a long beard, wearing red and white. Liam Neeson, who had taken the throne of Santa Claus one year prior, reached into his never ending sack and pulled out an AK-47. The last thing Joe heard before joining his wife in a pool of blood on the ground was, 
 
 *'' You're on the naughty list. `` * 
 
 ***KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA*** 
 
 Bullets tore through Joe, making holes like Swiss cheese. Nick knacks and dishes exploded in the kitchen behind him as he fell unceremoniously next to his wife and gazed into her cold, lifeless eyes, his vision fading slowly to black. 
 
 *'' Ho. Ho. Ho. *''

"`` Hello Dave - your dinner is ready.'' a cheerful automated voice said. 
 
 Dave grunted in response and opened his eyes. His gaze was met with a pixelated, smiling face. `` I told you, I'm not hungry.'' 
 
 `` I apologize, Dave. But as your personal cell companion, I have to make sure you are well fed.'' The robot's body was connected to the wall, and slid away from Dave's bed to the cell door. A sealed packet of gruel was in its hands. `` You have n't eaten for at least 18 hours. I'm concerned for you.'' 
 
 Dave sat up on his bed slowly. `` Listen, if I have to eat that yellow crap again, I'm going to throw up. Understand? I do n't know what you're giving me, but it is n't food for me.'' 
 
 The robot's expression turned into a frown. `` Your hesitation is understandable, but this food is edible for humans. The body just needs time to adjust to it.'' 
 
 `` I'll have it later. Just give me a second.'' Dave waved the robot away as he sat back down to stare at the ceiling. It was the third day of his ten-year sentence. Even now, Dave had no qualms about what he did. VeriCorp needed to be exposed, and he did just that - by leaking terabytes worth of confidential reports and financial dealings to a public server. Other employees were either paid off or threatened, but Dave did n't accept either as something that would stop him. He did n't think of himself as a whistleblower - just a stupid man who had tolerated evil for too long. 
 
 News outlets focused on Dave's crimes for months, and even became a bit of a celebrity. That gained the attention of Roblox Penitentiary - a prison known for holding some of the most violent and disturbed criminals in the Milky Way. They were willing to take him in for a reduced sentence. He would become the first human convict to ever be in an intergalactic prison. Instead of a triple life sentence in a facility approved by VeriCorp, Dave was given ten years in what was regarded by many as the most dangerous high-security prison in the galaxy. The fact that inmates barely even came into contact with each other did n't stop the alarming amount of murders that happened within these walls. VeriCorp did n't expect him to see the light of day. 
 
 Dave sighed. He should be more afraid. It'd be a miracle if he even survived the week. But he felt a strange sense of peace. He looked towards his robot companion. `` Tell me the stock value of Veritas Corporation right now.'' 
 
 It smiled. `` Yes, Dave. VeriCorp is priced at 17893.48.'' They had already decreased by half a percent while he'd been incarcerated. Investors were already starting to pull out. 
 
 `` What about the end of the week?'' Dave folded his arms in satisfaction. 
 
 `` They are expected to close out at 17623.34, which would be the worst closing in about 15 years.'' 
 
 `` Thank you. And uh... *cell companion? *'' Dave had to assign a name for that thing. 
 
 `` Yes, Dave?'' 
 
 `` I think I'm ready for my dinner now.'' 
 
 `` Excellent. I'm glad your appetite has returned!'' The robot moved quickly along the walls to his bedside. Dave took the packet. He held up the food package, as if giving a toast. 
 
 *To VeriCorp's demise, * he thought. Dave ripped open the bag, and swallowed the processed paste. He fought back the urge to gag. 
 
 Ten more years - just ten more years.

It was a smile that did not reach its eyes, a smile that mirrored the predatory grin of a predator who had its prey cornered.

The gruel packet in the robot's hand was an object of disdain. It was a testament to the artificiality of human sustenance, a food designed to sustain life but devoid of any semblance of flavor or cultural significance. As Dave sat back down on his bed, the robot's voice echoed through the cell, ""You have not eaten for at least 18 hours, Dave. I'm concerned for you.""

It was a voice dripping with concern, yet devoid of empathy. It was the voice of a machine playing the role of a human, a voice that failed to recognize the nuances of human suffering. Dave's anger was justified, his frustration palpable. He knew that what he was eating was not food, but a concoction designed to break his spirit. It was the food of the enslaved, of those who were objectified and controlled.

In the face of this inhumanity, Dave's resilience shone through. He did not submit to the whims of his captors. He knew that his ordeal was not merely about his own personal justice, but about the potential for change. He was a spark in the wind, a catalyst for rebellion against the oppressive forces of VeriCorp.

News of Dave's actions spread like wildfire. He became a symbol of hope for those who had been silenced for too long. His story was woven into the tapestry of human history, a testament to the enduring power of even the most ordinary individuals to bring about change. And so, as the robot wheeled away the packet of gruel, Dave sat alone in his cell, a man of courage and determination, knowing that his journey had only just begun."

"OX-10 let the gun hang in his hand, feeling the pull of the it's leash. He always kept it close to him, or at least, a part of him as he walked down the corridors of Level Delphi-6T. The white hexagon lights reflected brilliantly off of his black jacket as well as the glossed wood of his gun. Of course the wood was fake, but it was so close to the real thing that he just had to have it. To bad it was MMAD's. He liked the old gal. But that was the way of the Framework: `` Plug or be plugged'' ( In fact that was the OCT-7TH3 Gang's motto ). 
 
 And speaking of the old gal, he was on his way down this very corridor for one very specific reason: CRUZ-80. She was MMAD's, built straight off of the same line right before he was. Straight off of the line, he'd felt something for her. The rules down here were cut and clear: `` No union between different models'', but that was one rule he would break only in her case. The only reason he even knew MMAD was because CRUZ was there, and MMAD as sure knew it even though she never said. 
 
 The problem that the Law provided was of course, cross-model relations, but the difference between models really defined the punishment. If it was between models from two consecutive castes, Law required a branding of both. But at the level of OX-10's perceived relationship, it was full dismemberment and scrapping. 
 
 He rounded right and the white light faded into a mix of neon, playing havoc on his jacket. He'd entered the Delphi-6T Market A, one of the busiest. But there was no one there. OX-10 raised the gun and walked faster through the market. On the edge of his sight he saw something stand up. He quickly aimed the gun and fired a round into their shoulder, the force of the slug knocking them to the wall. `` Hold it!'' 
 
 OX-10 saw many more rise from behind the vendors. The hopped over the counters and came up slowly to him. `` It's OX-10, is n't it?'' One of them asked. He wore the a large coat that matched his blue, peeling face. Obviously the one they called `` Big Blue'' one of the beefcakes of OCT-7TH3. `` I have no idea why, but The Master wants your head. I'll give it to him, anyway you want me to.'' 
 
 OX-10 laughed. `` Why do you have all these guys if he asked you?'' 
 
 `` Your one of those OX models. Your supposed to be very resilient.'' 
 
 `` Of course I am. That's how I was built.'' 
 
 The goons had inched their way closely to OX-10 and Big Blue had n't even noticed it, at least not until to late. `` Get back!'' Big Blue yelled. Too late. OX-10 already had already let go of his gun and reached for a gun. He grabbed a stock to his right and pulled the goon forward, slamming their head onto the plasticrete ground with a crunch. He then turned his attention to another and launched at him. The goon fell as OX-10 bashed him with his fist. 
 
 The other goons began to fire as OX-10 began to run. He pulled himself up the virtually gripless wall and fell onto a stunned goon. Then he grabbed his gun and put two slugs into another. He dropped his gun and picked up a baton that one of the shot goons had. He mostly dodged the bullets from the other goons as he hopped along the walls and counters, dispatching each with speed and force. After he'd snapped the kneck of the last goon he turned his attention to Big Blue, who now held a rather large pistol at his side. `` Those were my drones!'' He screamed. 
 
 He lifted the pistol. OX-10 reached for his own gun at the same time. Both fired at the same time. OX-10 felt a force shove his left shoulder as his gun went off a second time. He saw the down flying from the hole in his jacket. 
 
 As he hit the ground he rolled in a way that he lay there facing Big Blue. The REGI unit stepped back, two smoldering holes puncturing his coat. OX-10 pulled himself up with the help of a counter and limped over to Big Blue, leaning against the wall for support. `` You really know how to give a good one, Blue.'' OX-10 said, `` to bad you had to be decommissioned.'' 
 
 Big Blue looked at OX-10. `` That's the most praise I've ever been given, thank you very much. Now push me over so this REGI unit can finally rest.'' 
 
 OX-10 reached for Big Blue, but his arm was too short. He tried kicking him, but to no avail. Finally, he grabbed the gun and put one final slug in Big Blue's head, sending blue fluid and bits of the carapace onto the wall. OX-10 then made his way, limping further down the market. Off in the distant was the all too familiar site of the CRUZ model. What a beauty she was, in her stunning gold color, especially in her black dress. `` OX!'' She cried. She sprinted to him, catching him in her arms as he fell. 
 
 OX-10 looked down at what she was worried about. Apparently he'd been hit more than he thought. White holes of down stuck out from the black jacket. `` Damn,'' he said. He looked at CRUZ-80. `` You know,'' he continued, `` you look lovely tonight. You sure do.'' 
 
 `` Come on, OX.'' She said, `` Come on stay with me.'' 
 
 She held him upright as they made their way to where CRUZ had originally been standing. They entered through an entryway that led to MMAD's place. `` I came out as soon as I heard the gunfire.'' She continued, `` Why did you come here at this time of night.'' She shut the door and locked and then began to take off OX-10's jacket. 
 
 `` You know,'' OX-10 said, `` Just out on a night stroll.'' 
 
 CRUZ-80 attended to the wounds. `` You said something about me'being lovely.''' 
 
 `` Oh yeah, that,'' he winced. Robots still felt pain. 
 
 `` No, no. Do n't leave me.'' 
 
 `` You... I... I... lof > > > ERROR 460 < < <

"," Adopt the exhilarating and descriptive style of a globetrotting adventurer, discovering new cultures.","The adrenaline rush of a globetrotting adventurer was evident in OX-10's swift strides through the intricate corridors of Level Delphi-6T. His gun, a testament to his unwavering determination, was an inseparable companion as he journeyed through this alien realm. The gleaming hexagon lights cast a surreal glow upon his black jacket, mirroring the gleam of his weapon's wood. While the wood was fake, its resemblance to the real thing evoked a sense of intensity, a reflection of his unwavering resolve.

The purpose of his journey was a singular one - CRUZ-80, his beloved MMAD. Despite the regulations prohibiting union between different models, he couldn't resist her allure. He knew that MMAD, privy to their intimate relationship, would understand his defiance. The laws implemented to prevent cross-model relations carried severe consequences, ranging from branding to dismemberment, depending on the severity. Yet, he had a compelling reason for breaking these rules - his unwavering love for CRUZ.

As he rounded a corner, the vibrant white light faded into a symphony of neon, illuminating the bustling market of Delphi-6T. There was an unsettling stillness in the air, and OX-10 felt a surge of anticipation. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, and he instinctively aimed his gun, firing a shot that sent the perpetrator tumbling to the wall. A wave of relief washed over him as he saw others rise from behind the vendors, their eyes filled with terror.

With a commanding presence, OX-10 stood amidst the throng of adversaries. He wore his signature coat, a testament to his unwavering identity. The market erupted into a frenzy as he moved with swiftness and precision, dispatching his foes one by one. The adrenaline of battle fueled his movements, and the echoes of gunfire reverberated through the halls of the market."
"Bob MacAroy, manager of the accounting department for John ’ s Tricks and Jokes Emporium, called me in. Two days ago the love of his life was taken, somebody had taken his collectible coffee mug. 
 
 The receptionist greeted me, Miss Vaughn. She had legs like spoiled cottage cheese, the smell of cherry filled the air. “ How are you doing handsome? ” 
 
 She was my kind of woman, the kind that liked to be fed. “ I ’ m doing great, now that I ’ ve met you ham hock. ” 
 
 She took a drag on her vape stick. “ Only my boyfriends call me ham hock. ” 
 
 “ And just how many boyfriends do you have? ” 
 
 She blew a cloud of vape juice in my face. “ None right now. ” 
 
 “ I ’ d love to see what ’ s under that mu mu, but I need to talk to Bob. ” I gave her a wink and a coupon for a two for one value meal at McDonald ’ s. 
 
 Miss Vaughn licked her lips, pocketing the coupon. “ We can use this later. ” She pointed down the hallway. “ Bob ’ s two offices down on the left. ” 
 
 Bob ’ s door was open, he sat at his desk solving a Rubix Cube. “ Mr. MacAroy? ” I asked. 
 
 He looked up from his Rubix Cube. “ Who wants to know? ” 
 
 “ I ’ m Tim, here about the missing coffee mug. ” 
 
 He motioned to the chair with an obvious whoopee cushion on it, I picked it up and sat down. “ So, tell me what happened. ” 
 
 Bob stood up and handed me the Rubix Cube. “ A week ago I bought a special mug imported from Africa. It had a coin embedded in it, a coin with the face of… ” He trailed off and looked out the window. “ President Obama. ” 
 
 I wasn ’ t really paying attention, I was engrossed with the Rubix Cube, but my ears perked when he talked about the greatest President to ever grace the world ’ s greatest country. “ What about Obama? ” 
 
 “ The coin had his face on it, a special order from the Bank of Liberia. It even has a certificate of authenticity. ” 
 
 The Rubix Cube fell apart in my hand. “ Sorry. ” 
 
 Bob sat back down. “ Don ’ t worry, it ’ s just a joke Rubix Cube. ” He put his head in his hands. “ That mug was one of a kind. ” 
 
 “ How much was it worth? ” 
 
 “ Almost twenty dollars, not including shipping and handling. ” 
 
 I shook my head. “ That could be quite a lot of money to some people. ” 
 
 “ What can you do? ” 
 
 I crushed the whoopee cushion, the farting sound aroused me. “ Actually, I ’ ve already solved the case, have everybody meet in here in one hour. ” 
 
 After an hour in the bathroom I came back to Bob ’ s office. Miss Vaughn was there, along with an indeterminate number of other people without names or any distinguishing features worth describing. 
 
 Bob stood in front of the group. “ Tim is here to get to the bottom of the theft of my mug. ” He waved me over. “ Go ahead Tim. ” 
 
 I took Tim ’ s place. “ Good afternoon everybody. This will be short and you can get back to your job as Receptionist and whatever it is everybody else does shortly. ” 
 
 “ That ’ s good, I love receiving things, especially from bulging men named Tim, ” Said Miss Vaughn. 
 
 I smirked. “ I know you love taking things Miss Vaughn, because it was you that took Bob ’ s collectible Obama mug. ” 
 
 Everybody gasped, one person fainted, Bob emitted odors. 
 
 Miss Vaughn put her hand to her chest. “ Darling, how can you accuse big old me of such a crime? ” 
 
 “ It is quite simple Miss Vaughn, I reviewed the last ten years of employment of every person that worked here. You have an eight year gap in your resume. ” 
 
 She crossed her arms. “ It ’ s a tough economy. ” 
 
 Out of my trench coat that I was wearing for some reason I produced Miss Vaughan's police record. “ I knew you would say that, because that ’ s exactly what you said when you were arrested eight years ago for theft. ” 
 
 She snorted. “ I don ’ t see what this has to do with Bob ’ s mug. ” 
 
 “ You ’ re right, but you forgot one thing Miss Vaughn. ” 
 
 “ And what ’ s that? ” 
 
 “ The security tape that clearly shows you stealing Bob ’ s mug. In fact I have no idea why Bob didn ’ t look at it in the first place. ” 
 
 Bob got up and stood behind Miss Vaughn. “ I knew it was her the entire time, but I couldn ’ t turn her in, I love her. ” 
 
 “ I have bad news for your Bob. Check her blouse pocket. ” 
 
 He reached in and pulled out the value meal coupon. “ It ’ s just a coupon, so what? ” 
 
 I checked my watch, which would have been more dramatic if I wore one. “ Look at the time, twelve thirty. I gave that coupon to her an hour ago, before lunch. ” 
 
 Bob looked at the coupon, then me, then the coupon, then me, then Miss Vaughn, then the coupon, then the realization hit him. “ Oh my God. ” 
 
 “ That ’ s right Bob, no fat person would ever allow a coupon for food to go unused. You see, Miss Vaughn has a terrible secret she has kept from all of you. ” I paused for dramatic effect. 
 
 “ What ’ s the secret? ” Asked one of the unnamed characters. 
 
 “ I ’ m glad you asked, ” I said, “ Miss Vaughn is actually skinny! ” 
 
 Miss Vaughn leaped from her chair at me like a cat after a brick. Bob and his unknown employees restrained her. “ You just had to come in and ruin everything, ” She said. 
 
 “ And what did he ruin Nancy? ” Asked Bob. 
 
 “ I was going to run away with the janitor, once I had that mug we could go anywhere in the world. ” 
 
 Some cops I had stashed in the hallway carried her away. 
 
 I patted Bob on the back. “ Well Bob, looks like those cops will get some coffee with their doughnuts. ” 
 “ What? ” Asked Bob. 
 
 “ Cops like to eat doughnuts, and she stole a coffee mug. You know, it sounded better in my head. ” 
 
 “ Oh. ” 
 
 I slowly backed out the door of Bob ’ s office. “ Well, that was supposed to be my ending line, so, uh, goodbye. ”

His heart was heavy as he mourned the loss of his beloved coffee mug, a priceless heirloom passed down through generations.

As he stared at the remnants of his cherished possession, a fleeting encounter with a captivating woman named Miss Vaughn interrupted his somber reverie. Her legs were as graceful as spoiled cottage cheese, and her scent of cherry filled the air, as intoxicating as a plume of sweet tobacco smoke. With a mischievous grin, she approached him, her voice dripping like honey.

""How are you doing, handsome?"" she asked, her eyes twinkling like stars.

""I'm doing great, now that I've met you, ham hock,"" Bob replied, his humor failing him.

A playful exchange of words and a wink of mischief ensued, but Miss Vaughn's heart was not set on games. She knew she had a captive audience and took the opportunity to offer her sweet words and a coupon for a two-for-one meal at McDonald's.

Bob was captivated by her charm and offered to share his story. He spoke of the mug, its unique history, and the treasured memories it held. As he recounted the tale, his sadness gradually dissipated, replaced by a sense of gratitude for the simple act of remembering.

The music paused, and the guests gathered around Bob, their eyes reflecting the soft glow of the moon. He held aloft the remaining fragment of his beloved mug, a symbol of life and resilience, and shared a toast to the memory of his departed treasure.

"Hmm. 
 
 He nudged the clump with his foot. 
 
 Yeah, that's definitely hair. Ugh. 
 
 He turned off the tap and knelt down. A clump of strands had swirled themselves around the inside of his drain, tendrils waving gently in the draining tub. He glanced down, reminding himself that yes, he had shaved, and no, that's not what this was. 
 
 Fucking subletters, he mumbled under his breath. The other floors of his building had been occupied by what seemed like a neverending stream of renters, none of whom stayed longer than 2 or 3 months at a time. After the first few tenants, he had stopped introducing himself. What was the point? 
 
 None, clearly, he reasoned, because they were so fucking gross that they let their hair clog up all the drains in the building. Christ. He cursed a few more times, grabbing a tissue and grasping at the mass. 
 
 So gross. 
 
 With the hair in the trash, he unkinked his limbs and climbed out of the tub. 
 
 Jesus! 
 
 Some of the hair must have fallen out of the paper when he threw it into the can. He ran his finger along the ledge of the tub, gathering the five or six stragglers and deposited them, almost gagging, into the toilet. 
 
 He straightened and gazed at his reflection. 
 
 Are you FUCKING serious? A hair, long and black, dangled from the corner of the mirrored cabinet. He seized it and flapped his hand back and forth, trying to shake it off. 
 
 Fuming, he reached for the cabinet and flung it open. Masses of dark hair tumbled out. He screamed and jumped back, expecting it to move. After thirty seconds of shallow breathing, he reached over and quickly passed his hand over the mass. Nothing. 
 
 Jesus Christ in Heaven. 
 
 He used his fingertips to knock his toothbrush into the sink and into the hair. It did n't move. That's when he remembered the date. 
 
 Aw Jesus. Fucking Halloween. Every year with this son of a bitch, every year he's got ta outdo himself - he sighed and closed the door of the cabinet, thoroughly relieved but still pissed that his friend insisted on scaring the shit out of him every year. 
 
 He grinned at his reflection, planning his revenge. Outside the bathroom, the girl waited. 
 

"," Adopt the weathered and tale-filled voice of an ancient mariner, full of sea lore.","Aye, me hearties, lend me your ears to a tale of hair gone rogue and the havoc it wreaked upon a humble apartment. It's a yarn spun from the salty sea and the weathered skin of a mariner who's seen more than his fair share of hair-raising experiences.

So gather around and let me spin the tale of the hair that wouldn't quit. It all began with a simple shave, a ritual as ancient as the tides. But fate had a cruel hand in store for this unsuspecting mariner. His drain, once pristine, became a graveyard for hair, a tangled mess of woe and frustration.

The hair, long and black as a stormy sea, danced around the drain like a siren's song, taunting the mariner. It was as if the hair had a mind of its own, a mischievous spirit bent on driving the poor man nuts. He cursed and raged, his patience worn thin as a sheet in a hurricane.

But the hair refused to budge. It was as if the devil himself had woven the strands, determined to torment the mariner. He attacked the hair with a fury born of desperation, but his efforts were in vain. The hair remained stubbornly intact, a testament to its stubborn nature.

In a moment of despair, the mariner recalled the date. It was Halloween, the day when the veil between the world of the living and the dead is thin as a sheet. And there he was, caught in a hair-raising battle with a spirit of mischief.

But the mariner's spirit was not broken. He fought back against the tide of hair, his determination burning bright like a beacon in the storm. With a sigh of relief, he finally cast the hair into the abyss, where it undoubtedly danced with the devil.

So, me hearties, let this tale serve as a warning to all: Beware the hair that won't quit, and always keep a sharp blade handy. And if you find yourself in a similar predicament, don't despair. Just remember, there's a mariner out there who's been through it all, and he's more than willing to share his tales."
"`` But... but, it's a solid gold rolls royce. What do you mean it's not worth your time?'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry sir, but our currency just does n't work that way. Sure, you can bring your wealth with you, sure. But your earthly wealth is n't not immortal wealth.'' 
 
 `` Well.. if all I brought is worthless to everyone around me, what is the currency you run on?'' 
 
 `` Dirt. Rocks. The simple materials that made up the ground you spit on. Silly man... while you spent your life down *there* clawing to get your wildest dreams, the only ones with real wealth, ETERNAL wealth, were those you stepped on to get here. Silly, silly man.. do you really even think you belong up here? With us? Ha! No. We have a plan for you...''
"," Adopt the contemplative and rhetorical style of an ancient philosopher, using logic and ethical musings.","The worldly possessions, often coveted and flaunted, hold little significance when juxtaposed against the notion of eternal wealth. While the allure of material opulence may be enticing, it is essential to recognize that these possessions are transient and impermanent. The true treasures that endure the test of time lie in the realm of spiritual wealth, cultivated through mindfulness and compassion.

Therefore, the question of monetary value becomes irrelevant when confronted with the realization that earthly wealth is fleeting and illusory. When we contemplate the transient nature of material possessions, we find that the currency of true wealth lies in the realm of enduring values, such as wisdom, virtue, and compassion.

In essence, the avaricious pursuit of worldly riches ultimately leads us away from the path of genuine fulfillment. True wealth, rooted in spirituality and compassion, allows us to transcend the limitations of material possessions and cultivate a sense of interconnectedness with all beings.

Therefore, we must question the superficial allure of worldly wealth and cultivate the inner riches that provide true contentment and meaning. By embracing the doctrine of eternal wealth, we unlock a path that leads us beyond the confines of material possessions and into the realm of boundless possibilities."

 Sergeant Gregori Renfro ’ s eye twitched. He wanted sorely to itch it or scratch it, but he was already strapped in. *S ’ not like I ’ d want to anyways, damn suit gloves aren ’ t fit for jabbin in your eyes. * George hated the wait before a drop. It was their first, all of their first time. They had done thousands of simulations, dozens of training drops, but this was the unit ’ s first combat drop. 
 
 As valiant as the locals were, he doubted they stood a chance without serious intervention. They would stand up for themselves, but were sorrily outclassed by the aggressors who had now set upon them. 
 
 But now the first squad, Weapons Platoon, 1st Mobile Armor Company, Vanguard Marine Corps was strapped into their four man drop pods, chambered like massive bullets into tubes four thru six. 
 
 It felt like hours since others in the company had launched. They were still awaiting their intel package to download. The whole mission was a rush job. Stonewater had them spin up the minute they left Sanctuary, the minute they knew the Kell fleet was headed for the planet Seggren, but they had to wait until they arrived to narrow the scope. 
 
 A light blinked on the display inside his hood and data began to flow into his suit ’ s onboard computer. A screen materialized on the inside of his copula to the left of his face. The text WALON overlaid a topo-map for a few seconds before reducing to a corner. Translator data ticked along the bottom, along with minor cultural nuances. Streams of imagery began to show on a separate display to the right. 
 
 Gregori turned his head and sipped from his hydration straw giving him some added fuel for his pre-drop ritual. Taking advantage of the suit ’ s waste system, he removed the pressure from his bladder. 
 
 Mentally, he tapped into the suit ’ s communication node, “ Alright gentle-beings, we ’ re – ” the pod slipped into its final prelaunch position, breaking Sergeant Renfro ’ s train of thought for a split second. As the release clamps locked into place again, he knew the drop was moments away. “ As I was saying, we ’ re about to drop and clear the way for Second Battalion to land. Target is an airstrip just outside Walon. Looks like the local Spaceport. We ’ ll crashdown, in the city outside and sow some confusion amongst the enemy prior to. Full brief should have uploaded to your suits by now. Everyone read it? Any questions? ” 
 
 Across his squad tactical panel, confirmation signals just below the status signals, lit up green signifying “ all good, no questions ”. Then one shifted from green to orange, Lance Corporal Tiv denWildfur had changed his mind. 
 
 Gregori opened up the link, “ Yeah, Tiv? ” 
 
 The Coloplfian cackled slightly over the squad channel, “ When can we get some burritos? I ’ m starving. ” 
 
 Sergeant Renfro sighed, “ I do n't think the locals have them, Tiv. You can sample the fare *after* we're done. ” 
 
 A large “ 10 ” appeared centimeters from his face. It faded into a “ 9 ”. *You know, sometimes I wish they ’ d just drop us rather than have the buildup of a count d–* 
 
 The acceleration of the drop cut him off. In the pods they were in zero g, free from artificial gravity. Upon launch, the systems did their best to create a limiting field effect around them. It cut the g forces to ten percent, but it still kicked like a mule. After a few moments, acceleration gave way to stabilized flight. 
 
 Gregori could feel the adjustment thrusters nudging the pod. Gently at first, the tug of gravity returned. Then the shuddering began, followed the main thrusters kicking in forcing them into an accelerated burn. 
 
 *Two seconds and…* 
 
 With a pop, bang, and a hiss the drop-pod broke into four tear shaped meteors, shedding a good deal of debris into the air behind them. 
 
 *Another three seconds…Need some music. Computer, play: * Atreyu-Doomsday. *Medium Volume, Auto-fade for incoming communications. * Gregori had taken a few liberties with regulations and coded into his suit a basic music emulator, but ensured that it would not interfere with his situational awareness by coding it in a manner that allowed the audio systems of the suit to override it under specific circumstances. 
 
 The speakers near his head began to build up a crescendo of throbbing guitars, just as the air around him exploded. Scattering behind him, the protective shell that held him flew away. Thin wisps of clouds buffeted him as he plummeted. He checked his readouts. Everyone was still green, everyone was now in free-fall. 
 
 He glanced left to see Corporal Trask, wrapped in his golem-esque synthsteel suit, falling like a skydiver. Each of the Mark II suits protected, enhanced, and empowered even the smallest Sat ’ ra. Variations on this model existed for each species in the Vanguard, increasing the size of the wearer to just slightly larger than a Kell. Obviously some variants had more mechanics than others. 
 
 Rushing up at him from below, the ground looked far from welcoming. Smoke and ruble ruined the symmetrical layout of the ancient city. It was the capital of the region and an important transport hub. 
 
 Music faded as he willed the squad comm line open, “ Breaking in five. Tiv you ’ re falling to fast, break now. Everyone else…NOW! ” 
 
 The music built into a symphony of anger as his boot and pack thrusters flared to life. Sergeant Renfro braced himself as he came crashing into the pavement on a foot and knee. The suit reacted in kind, allowing him to maintain his balance. His massive boot left a fifty centimeter long indentation in the asphalt. 
 
 Gregori recovered quickly and retrieved his Khamber-Five Enhanced Assault Rifle from its back-mounted attachment point. The K5 was designed for the larger fingers of the suit. Weapons Company normally carried bigger weapons than the K5 and would also be attached to line units in a much different manner. Today however, they were running like a standard Mobile Armor line Company. 
 
 Fading the end of the song, he called out. “ Sound off, Hellhounds. ” One by one, the twelve other members of first squad responded. No issues yet. “ Adjust to me, wide diamond. Fifty meter dispersion. Remember the ROE. No locals, no matter what they shoot at you. S ’ not like any of it will make a dent, short of a tank. Watch your shots too, urban considerations. ”

 There's more, but that's the end of the song.

The scent of damp earth and burning coal filled the air, a symphony of olfactory delights and dangers. Sergeant Gregori Renfro, a man of impeccable deduction and unwavering resolve, stared at the case file, his mind unraveling the intricate plot that had brought him to this foggy evening.

The scene unfolded like a tapestry, each thread meticulously woven together. The Kell fleet, notorious for its brutality, had targeted the planet Seggren, leaving behind a trail of destruction. Sergeant Renfro, leading the charge, had to grapple with the daunting task of outmatching the aggressors and protecting his men.

As he donned his suit and strapped himself into the drop pod, a wave of anticipation washed over him. The countdown commenced, and with a roar, the pod detached itself from the landing pad, soaring through the air like a meteor. The world below him blurred into a kaleidoscope of colors, a testament to the sheer force of acceleration.

The intel package downloaded, revealing the layout of the battlefield and the positions of the enemy. With lightning speed, Gregori and his squad maneuvered their way through the labyrinth of corridors, their weapons blazing. The aggressors, caught off guard, were met with fierce resistance. One by one, they fell, their reign of terror brought to an end.

As the dust settled, Sergeant Renfro surveyed the scene, his mind reeling from the battle. The city lay in ruins, but the spirit of the victors resonated through the air. He knew that the price of victory was high, but he also understood that it was a necessary sacrifice to protect the innocent.

With a sigh, Gregori Renfro turned to leave, his gaze scanning the cityscape below. The fog shrouded him, but his spirit remained unbroken. He knew that in this tumultuous world, the battle for justice was an unending one, and he was determined to continue his fight, one case at a time."

 The girl was shaking, not in excitment or passion, but with horrible seething rage. She covered her mouth to hide the foaming. 
 
 `` I ca n't believe this...'' she said. 
 
 `` You have made my life better in every way.'' he said. 
 
 Her eyes began to twitch. Vivid visions of every attempt she made to ruin his life flashed before her blood shot eyes. Why? Why try anymore? Perhaps this was the universe telling her something.

 They called us explorers, told us that we were the real scientists who were pushing the boundaries of what we knew of our earth. But the GPS trackers and armed guards surrounding us reminded us of our past. We were debtors, given the choice to die in a quick fall off the face of the earth, or rot in prison repaying our debts with years wasting away. 
 
 I hooked myself in to the ground plate, and walked over to the last rock jutting out over the dark abyss. It felt like a walk along the plank to step lightly across the stone. I turned around, and crouched down at the very edge. To my left, I saw four or five others getting into a similar position. I breathed in deeply, and then pushed myself backwards. I had no intention of investigating what lay below the surface, only to end my life in a quick manner. The rope betrayed me, though, and caught on the safety release. I was left hanging in darkness, spinning around endlessly in the abyss. I managed to pull a knife from my belt, and began to saw through the rope. It was slow going, but my frantic pace made quick work of the knotted string that held me away from the inevitable end. 
 
 Then I fell. Simply fell. Never to rise again. 

"," Embrace the whimsical and rhyming style of Dr. Seuss, making the text playful and imaginative.","In a land far, far away, there lived a group of explorers,
They were pushed to the edge, without a rope.
They called themselves scientists, but their actions were wrong,
The GPS trackers and guards, a reminder of the past.

A walk along the plank, a leap over the void,
They jumped into the abyss, with nothing to hold.
But fate intervened, the rope held tight,
And they hung in the air, day and night.

With a knife in their belt, they began to cut,
The rope gave way, and they fell with no strut.
The end was near, a sweet release,
And their journey came to an eternal peace."
"2127... That's my name, or at least it is now. I've been locked up for 13 years so far for a mistake I made. Drunk me thought it was fine to drive and whose and hehold, I killed a lady and her 4 kids. Life with no parol, I guess I deserve it, but I miss my family. I would do anything to see them. 
 
 The distinctive click of his cell lock opening woke him from his sleep. Exhaustion gripping him tightly as if he had only slept for an hour or so. He quickly examined himself to check for any scarring. This inmate is known to hurt himself in his sleep.The guard called into his radio to turn the lights on in cell 307. As the light blinded the inmate, the guard began to speak. 
 
 `` 2127, get up! The warden wants a word with you.'' 
 Still struggling to see through the sudden bright light, 2127 rose to his feet. The guards were abnormally quiet and the hall is n't filled with its usual noise of inmates yelling and fighting. Finally they reached the garden's office. 
 
 The guard opened the door and there stood the warden, gazing out of his window as if this was a movie. The guards left them and shut the door behind them. The warden was a short stocky man, dressed in what appeared to be a cheap tan suit. He turned and smiled, `` 2127, he'll I have n't seen you since one of your'episodes'.'' The stocky man chuckled a bit. 
 
 The prisoner knew better than to speak unless told to. He nervously traced the scars on his arms left by his last'episode' waiting for permission to speak. 
 
 `` I personally do n't think you're a bad man. I read your file and know it was merely an accident. I have decided to adopt a new program that will allow you your freedom.'' The excited tone did nothing to help the uneasy grin off the warden's face. `` This of course comes at a price. Shorten your sentence and the worse things will become for you here. I can even shorten it to one day, if you would like. I'm pretty sure I already know the answer anyways, what about it champ?'' 
 
 2127 did n't even blink before nodding yes. Quickly the warden stood up and grabbed the inmate's arm. `` I knew it, I'll even be nice and start the 24 hours now. Follow me.'' 
 
 More and more hallways, all of them just plain white. After a while the halls appear almost endless. Finally we stop at a door that was way too far from any other door, this made the inmate uneasy. The warden slaps the prisoner on the back, `` 24 hours... Then you're free.'' The warden performed some knock that the inmate could gather was a sign the warden was giving to the person inside. Suddenly the door slowly opened and to the inmate's surprise, a tall man wearing a lab coat appeared from the darkness of the doorway. The warden greeted him with a handshake, `` All right doc, you got 21 hours.'' Quickly the doctor hurried the inmate in. Before 2127 could even speak, the doctor managed to hit the prisoner in the neck with a syringe. 
 
 Blood... That's what the warm liquid on his pants was. Pain wracked his body as he began to feel old wounds open again. The inmate screamed in a mix of terror and pain. He looked down to watch the doctor peeling back the skin of the prisoner's right pinky. Everything was so dark, but the pain and screams seemed to make that detail moot. 
 
 Slice after slice, now 3 fingers were peeled back. The peel was definitely done by a professional as it appeared you could slimply slip the skin back on. The pink flesh pulsated as the air began to touch the wound. 2127 throws up again. 
 
 The doctor removed his mask and looked the inmate in the eye, `` You wanted the shorter sentence, and you were warned.'' A smile crept over his face. `` I can honestly say I do enjoy this. Especially for you. I have opened a majority of your wounds, I hope the pain is worth it.'' The doctor just casually spoke as 2127 shook and vomited in front of the doctor, the pain causing screams. 
 
 The demeanor of the doctor suddenly changed as he grabbed the inmate's hair, `` Maria... Chelse... Tiffany... Eli... And of course my wife, Amanda. Do these names ring a bell to you?'' After a moment without a visual response from the tortured prisoner, the doctor grabbed a skinned finger and squeezed. The slick flesh bled like a sponge and the inmate cried out in agony. Quickly 2127 shook his head. 
 
 `` They are the ones you killed. I found you and now I swore to make you feel this pain.'' The doctor smiles, `` You think this is your first time here? Sorry, Jake.'' The doctor grabbed a drill from the table, `` I have been a brain doctor for quiet some time, and after I'm done torturing you, I'm going to use this to drill at the back of your scull. I will ensure that all of this is just another'episode'. But I always like to have this chat with you before I make you forget. It is true about your sentence, but I wo n't let you do it, I want you to pay.'' 
 
 Screams... Horrible screams.
"," Rewrite this as if it were a narrative set in a distant, technologically advanced future, including futuristic slang and concepts.","In the year 2127, a solitary confinement cell in a futuristic penal institution echoed with the rhythmic click of the cell lock opening. The weary prisoner, 2127, awoke from his slumber, his exhaustion clinging to him like a shroud. As he surveyed his reflection in the dim light, he noticed the scars that adorned his arms, a painful reminder of his recent ""episode.""

The guard's voice crackled through the intercom, commanding 2127 to rise. The hall was eerily quiet, devoid of the usual cacophony of inmates' shouts and struggles. As he made his way to the garden's office, the prisoner felt a sense of dread.

The door swung open, revealing the warden, his eyes gazing out at the horizon. He turned to 2127, a smile plastered across his face. ""2127, I have a proposition for you,"" he announced, his voice dripping with honeyed sweetness. ""I believe you're a good man, albeit a bit troubled. I've devised a program that will grant you freedom, but at a cost.""

The prisoner listened intently, his mind reeling from the possibility of redemption. As the warden's grin widened, he sensed a hint of cunning manipulation behind his words. ""This offer comes with a caveat,"" the warden warned, his tone shifting from friendly to menacing. ""If you shorten your sentence, the punishments will become more severe. I can even offer you one day of freedom, if you choose. I'm sure you already know the answer, 2127, what do you say?""

As 2127 contemplated his options, he weighed the potential consequences of his decision. The warden's words echoed in his mind, ""A deal's a deal, champ."" And in that moment, 2127 made a choice that would forever alter the course of his existence."
"It was hopeless. The case was unsolvable. For 13 years, Conrad had never failed to bring a criminal to justice. At least, not anyone he tried to get. And damn it, did Conrad try and get the sick fuck who murdered Governor Pagan. Sure, he might not have been the best governor the state ever had, but he did his job. He was honest. He pushed for important laws to be passed. He had always tried his best, with honest intentions, and that was a rare occurrence in politics. So, it was a shock to the world when the news reported that he was found with his skull bashed in, lying dead in his office. Immediately upon hearing of the murder, Conrad volunteered for the case. He had been feeling bored with his job, and was ready for another case that would put the spring in his step. So he was partnered with a newbie, and put as the lead on the investigations. At the start of the case, Conrad was so excited to finally be on the hunt again. So how did it get to this point? 
 “ So fill me in on the suspects. ” Jim had decided to join the search in a last minute effort to catch the crook. 
 “ Forget it, it ’ s hopeless. We ’ ve got nothing on this guy. Me and Rooke here were just about to pack up. ” Conrad noticed that by Rooke ’ s expression, he definitely was not on board with this plan. 
 “ Oh come on, you ’ re Cold-blooded Conrad. If I thought that there ever came a day that a someone could commit a crime, and avoid Cold-Blooded Conrad, I ’ d quit right here and now, ‘ cuz clearly we ’ ve got a master on our hands. But we don ’ t, do we? He left a trail. Follow it! ” Conrad sighed. Jim just didn ’ t understand the situation they were in. Rooke decided to fill in the gaps. 
 “ So, we have already got it down to three suspects. ” 
 “ Two. ” 
 “ Three! We ’ ve got ta keep an open mind. ” Conrad rolled his eyes. The new kid clearly was a little too inventive with how the murder could have happened. Or a little too stupid to even be work as a cop. 
 “ Hey, three suspects? That ’ s a low number! We could get a confession. ” 
 “ Jim, you don ’ t understand, none of these guys will crack, and there ’ s nothing definitive on any of ‘ em. ” 
 “ Look, at the very least, let me hear about the suspects. ” Conrad sighed. It was clear that he wasn ’ t convincing these two that to give up the chase. Whatever, he might as well give it one last think-through. 
 “ Our first suspect is the governor ’ s son, ” Rooke offered. “ Tyler Pagan. Examining the body ’ s phone shows that the two were clearly in a big fight. Apparently, Pagan was not as good a father as he was a politician. ” Conrad winced. He didn ’ t want to talk about this line of reasoning to far; the texts suggest that he may have hit the son, and if the media ever got wind of this, they ’ d have a field day. That didn ’ t seem like the best way of honoring the man or comforting the family. 
 “ Additionally, when you enter the building, you need to show your ID card, ” Conrad elaborated. “ The only card scanned was Tyler ’ s, and it shows him entering at evening. Catch is, you don ’ t need to scan the card to leave, so we have no idea whether he left the building. There ’ s a strong possibility after meeting with his father he never left, and went and did the deed. And also, he doesn ’ t have a solid alibi for the murder time. ” 
 “ Wait a second. ” Something seemed to have thrown Jim off. “ The son was the only one to enter that day? That ’ s odd, right? ” Conrad shook his head. 
 “ Today was a vacation day. The governor decided to work anyways. ” Jim shook his head. 
 “ Well, might explain the family situation a bit. But, hold on, the son was the only one who entered? Well doesn ’ t that eliminate all other possibilities? ” Rooke decided to cut back in. 
 “ There ’ s a side door to the building, that only a few people have a key to. Well, uh, two. This one doesn ’ t have need you to scan anything. The governor has a key, which is how he entered. His wife also has a key. ” Hmmph. Why there was a need for a side door specifically for the governor and his wife, Conrad didn ’ t know. 
 “ It ’ s the usual fare; she ’ s mentioned in his will. She ’ d inherit a lot. The key couldn ’ t have been stolen or anything, it ’ s reported she has it on her person at all times. And again, the wife has no alibi. ” Jim looked exasperated. 
 “ I see what you mean. It ’ s a bit of a toss up. Both of them seem pretty likely. ” Conrad patently agreed. Objectively, there were two solid murder possibilities presented before him. Yet his instincts told him that that neither of them did it. It didn ’ t make sense. It should be one of them. But these were the instincts that had gotten him his title. Were they betraying him now? 
 “ So who ’ s this third suspect? ” 
 “ Ugh. ” Conrad audibly groaned. There wasn ’ t enough time to waste on threads like this. 
 “ Look, let ’ s think about this. ” Rooke was indignant. “ You said you didn ’ t think the son or the wife did it. This could be the criminal! ” 
 “ Well, now I ’ m curious, who is this suspect? ” 
 “ The governor ’ s pet, ” Rooke responded. Jim was shocked. 
 “ The governor has a pet? I had no idea. ” 
 “ Well, it makes sense. He likes to keep it a secret. ” 
 “ A secret pet? What could possibly make him want to hide something like that? Pets are great for PR. And hold on, the pet was in his office? ” 
 “ Yup, he keeps it right in the room with him. ” 
 “ So, you think a pet murdered him with a blunt object? That ’ s, uh, not really an animal thing. ” 
 “ Well, this pet doesn ’ t fit with a typical animal style. They ’ d definitely kill bluntly. ” 
 “ Well what is it? Really, I ’ m so curious. ” 
 “ Damn it Jim, it ’ s a fucking rock, ” Conrad shouted. He had gotten fed up with this. Jim was shocked. 
 “ Wh… What? ” 
 “ Billy. The rock ’ s name is Billy. Governor Pagan, the ex-leader of South Carolina, owned a pet rock which he named Billy, and our new member of the police investigation team is suggesting that this rock is responsible for this assassination. ” Jim was just flabbergasted. 
 “ You… you have to be joking, right? ” Rooke, for his part, stood his ground. 
 “ He was at the crime scene. He should be considered. ” Jim chuckled to himself. 
 “ Of course, heh heh. No wonder this has been such a rocky investigation. I-I mean, heh, we ’ re really between a rock and a hard place. Man, no wonder this case really rocks. Bwahahahaha. ” Jim was near cracking himself up. Neither Conrad nor Rooke even chuckled. After Jim pulled himself back together, he continued, “ but in all seriousness, for the real suspects, is there any reason we can ’ t get a conviction? Other than, you know, the uncertainty between the two of them. ” 
 “ Alright, might as well get to this point, ” Conrad said, with defeat in his voice. Here was when Jim ’ s confidence broke. “ Due to budget cuts, the building has one video camera. But, boy howdy, is it a damning one to our case. It shows the one entrance to the room where the governor was killed, and no one entered or exited after the son had left at the evening. The camera wasn ’ t tampered with. ” 
 “ Oh. ” Jim sat down, with a blank look on his face. The realization had finally hit him. They were looking at an impossible murder. 
 “ Correction. ” Rooke popped in. “ The camera shows most of the entrance. There ’ s a few inches by the floor it doesn ’ t see. ” 
 “ So? It doesn ’ t change a thing. ” Conrad was a little on edge. 
 “ I disagree. ” Jim and Conrad exchanged a glance. 
 “ Alright, ” Jim said. “ I ’ ll bite. What does it change. ” 
 “ Billy hasn ’ t been found yet. Billy is a few inches high. The height to get out of that place. ” Jim slammed his foot to the ground in frustration. He was not having this. 
 “ Are you going off on this rock thing? Are you insane? ” 
 “ No, I ’ m seeing clear. I ’ ve cracked the case, this rock, Billy, if that is his name, has clearly made a political move. Perhaps he was paid off by a rival politician, we may not know. ” 
 “ Kid, I hope to hell you ’ re joking. More importantly, I hope that the commissioner finds this more funny than I do right now. 
 “ I ’ m not done. The injury. I checked with the autopsy team, and guess what they found trace amounts of in the injury? ” Rooke didn ’ t wait for a response. “ Gravel. ” There was a brief silence. Everyone sat still for a second. 
 “ Boom. Case closed. ” 
 “ You can ’ t be serious, ” Jim was pissed. “ Get out. Get out right now. I can ’ t deal with you. Conrad, tell him to get out. ” Conrad remained silent. Stupefied. He had a 13 year long career. He had seen a lot of things. He had heard a lot of things. A lot of stupid things. Almost everything. 
 “ Rooke, ” Conrad said, with a steely voice. “ Put out an APB for one Billy the rock. We ’ re going to have to act fast if we want to catch this guy, I ’ ve got a feeling he can blend in well. ” But in his 13 year career, he had never thought he ’ d be outdone by a rookie. 
 “ You ’ ve got to be kidding me. ” Jim had stood up at this point, and his voice was getting shaky. “ Conrad, what the hell! Have you lost it, get a grip! ” Conrad had stopped listening. His instincts had made up their mind. It had been less that a day, and the suspect could only get but so far on foot. With enough distance, and a swim in a river, they might be able to blend in with locals. Conrad needed to act swiftly, and cut them off before this could happen. Conrad chuckled. The hunt was on. 

", Use the confident and jargon-heavy language of a Wall Street banker.,"It was an egregious matter. The case was beyond resolution. For thirteen consecutive years, Conrad had meticulously brought to justice each and every criminal he had encountered. And the bastard who murdered Governor Pagan was no exception. Sure, the governor might not have been the most distinguished politician, but he had undoubtedly served his country with integrity, passing legislation and championing important causes. Therefore, it was a profound shock to the world when the news broke of his untimely demise. Not surprisingly, Conrad immediately volunteered for the case, eager to reignite his passion and put his unparalleled skills to work. He was partnered with a novice detective, and together, they embarked upon the arduous journey to bring the perpetrator to justice. The start of the case was replete with excitement and anticipation, but as the investigation unfolded, the reality of the situation began to sink in. ""So fill me in on the suspects,"" Jim pleaded, eager to join the search. ""Forget it, it's hopeless,"" Conrad declared, his voice dripping with resignation. It was evident that Rooke was not entirely on board with the idea of continuing the investigation. Despite his reluctance, Conrad saw an opportunity for a breakthrough and urged Rooke to follow the trail. As the investigation progressed, it became clear that the new detective was a bit too imaginative and lacked the necessary discernment to navigate the complexities of the case."

A palpable tension hung in the air, as if the universe itself held its breath in anticipation.

 Unfortunately, the time to flee had long since passed. Within minutes the very world around us would be turned to ash, a toxic wasteland branded onto the face of this doomed Earth. 
 
 However, during the chaos I did what those around me could not - I remained calm. The will to live burned brightly inside of me, brighter than the nuclear storm that seemed destined to engulf me. Thinking fast, I gutted the majority of my refrigerator and climbed inside. 
 
 It was quiet, almost idyllic. In fact it was rather comfortable - up until the bombs fell at least. I do n't remember much after that, other than waking up some time after, still encased in my chilled shelter. 
 
 You would n't believe my excitement and surprise, although, you need n't bother. My glee was very short lived. While I had indeed survived the onslaught of nuclear rain that had washed over me, it seemed that ultimately, one's fate can not be so easily avoided. 
 
 Protruding from my chest was a large, solid carrot. 
 
 For several minutes, pain burned through me. I began to feel faint as my crippled body drained into what was destined to be my cold tomb. After a short time, the pain subsided and a feeling of calming warmth washed over me, my vision fading into an unfocussed blur. My eyes began to close, and as I lost consciousness I could n't help but think...

The era of the 1950s had brought with it a unique set of cultural references that shaped the suburban landscape. The sleek lines and gleaming chrome of automobiles symbolized the burgeoning American middle class, epitomizing the spirit of prosperity and progress. The ubiquitous presence of the perfect home, complete with its gleaming kitchen appliances and comfortable living room, represented the pinnacle of the American dream.

"A single strip of pavement cut through the brush, its surface cracked and broken, speckled with branches. The trees twisted their way overhead, dropping leaves unnoticed onto the forgotten road while the birds chirped overhead. 
 
 In the distance, the river rumbled, its course strong and powerful as it rushed onward, passing by the forgotten grid of asphalt and hollow concrete squares, bare footprints where homes once stood, where children played and old men died, where meals were cooked and produce sold. The roads pass by the empty shells, pale gray between the weeds, a shadow of a memory of the time when horses stamped or cars drove.

 `` Give. Me. You-'' His eyes rolled back in his head as blood gurgled in his throat. A clean cut went right through his black ski mask, as blood soaked into it.

"`` Why ca n't you be a café maiden, like your older brother?'' 
 
 I found myself screaming at my daughter. She stood before me, bold as brass, right smack in the middle of our family business dressed as a magical girl. The one thing I promised her mother would never happen. 
 
 `` The world is in peril,'' she said. Stating the too obvious. 
 
 `` The world is always in peril!'' I said, `` When are you going to get it through your head there is always going to be a giant monster, or werewolves, or vampires, or some giant rampaging transgendered jabberwocky roaming the world somewhere, but it is not for you to save us from it.'' 
 
 `` I was chosen father!'' she said. 
 
 She raised a staff above her head and transformed right there, into her battle form, with the whole café watching. Magical girl outfits were always on the unmodest side but this outfit was deliberately pushing it to the extremes. It made it extremely obvious, Maaya was not a little girl anymore. Ever since she had grown much taller than me, her father, she had been getting increasingly rebellious. Looking up at this enchanted Titania reminded me of her mother, which was not helping with my mood. 
 
 `` Magical girls always lead to a bad end,'' I pleaded with her. 
 
 Then I pointed to my eldest son, Yukio, serving drinks at the far end, trying his best in vain to draw attention away from us. 
 
 `` Look at your brother! A handsomer man in a maid outfit you will never find, and proud of it! He'll be graduating from business college just a few years and I will hand over the café to you two and retire. I ca n't handle my children spending their lives fighting evil. Always in danger!'' 
 
 `` Mother was a magical girl, father!'' screamed Maaya, `` She protected us from danger. You have no idea what you're talking about.'' 
 
 That was the last straw. I pulled small baton from my maid apron showed this little upstart how one properly transforms into a magical girl. A bright sprinkling pink dress with the cat ears of a warrior I had not worn in over a decade. With panties, garters, and fishnets, not this g-string and tattoo nonsense they tarted around in these days. 
 
 Maaya was of course stunned. 
 
 `` You... you were Kamaya Catboy? The great defender of the city?'' 
 
 My baton transformed into a great staff which I thumped upon the floor to emphasize I was putting my foot down. Magical thunder shook the city with my might. 
 
 `` Now you know I do know what I'm talking about.'' 
 
 I gripped my staff with both hands as I fought to find the courage to retell the most painful memory of my life. 
 
 `` Your mother and I fought together to send Queen Athaliah, back to the netherworld, that battle cost your mother her life. As she lay dying in my arms I promised I would do everything I could to keep you and your brother safe. The both of you were just babies at the time. I had to raise you alone. I did everything I could to keep you two away from magical questing so you would not pick up your mother's curse. That's what it means to be a magical girl. You will fight until you die or you see you loved ones killed! You're too young to understand what it can cost you.'' 
 
 `` I understand that if you refuse to defend this city as Kamaya Catboy, someone has to take your place,'' said Maaya. 
 
 She pointed her staff at my own and fired a magical beam of lighting, causing me to drop it. Just like her mother, she was much more powerful than I, and far more stubborn. If she wanted to fight evil, I could n't stop her. In the distance there was another rumble. Some great Kaiju or some other damn thing was rising from the sea to have a bit of a snit at the city. Maaya took to the air, like an avenging angel. 
 
 `` I'm going, father,'' she said, `` Please do n't banish me from home for disobeying you.'' 
 
 I could n't stop myself from crying. 
 
 `` No. Your mother would never forgive me.'' 
 
 As Maaya flew off I picked up my staff. Something I swore to never pick up again. As I watched Maaya fly into battle through teary eyes, my son Yukio approached me. It was obvious he knew the whole time his younger sister was a magical girl. 
 
 `` I do n't suppose you have some great secret to share with me?'' I asked, stupidly. 
 
 Yukio transformed into a black mage. At least the outfit was tasteful, especially compared to his sister. 
 
 `` She can use a little help, she's a beginner you know,'' he said. 
 
 He had a point. Together we took to the air like a team of superheroes, defending the city. If I could not keep my children from danger, the least I could do was train them at my best to gain victory. 

"," Use the eloquent and witty language of an Elizabethan playwright, full of double entendres.","""Why can't you be a café maiden, like your older brother?"" I roared, my voice dripping with honeyed venom.

My daughter, Maaya, stood tall, her defiance as bold as brass. Outfitted in her gaudy magical girl attire, she had transformed our family business into her own personal stage. One thing I had promised her mother would never happen.

""The world is in peril,"" Maaya declared, her voice dripping like honey. ""It always is!""

I snorted. ""The world is always in peril! When are you going to get it through your head that there's always going to be a giant monster, or werewolves, or vampires, or some giant rampaging transgendered jabberwocky roaming the world somewhere, but it is not for you to save us from it.""

""I was chosen father!"" Maaya argued, her voice dripping like honey. She raised her staff, transforming into her battle form, the whole café watching. Her magical girl outfit, though modest, was pushed to the extremes, making it obvious that Maaya was no longer a little girl. Ever since she had grown much taller than me, her father, she had been getting increasingly rebellious. Looking up at this enchanted Titania reminded me of her mother, which was not helping with my mood.

""Magical girls always lead to a bad end,"" I pleaded, my voice dripping like honey. ""Look at your brother!"" I pointed to my eldest son, Yukio, serving drinks at the far end, trying his best in vain to draw attention away from us. ""He's a handsomer man in a maid outfit you will never find, and proud of it. He'll be graduating from business college just a few years and I will hand over the café to you two and retire. I can't handle my children spending their lives fighting evil. Always in danger!""

Maaya's defiance faltered. ""Mother was a magical girl, father! She protected us from danger. You have no idea what you're talking about.""

That was the last straw. I retrieved my trusty baton from my maid apron, the symbol of authority, and showed this little upstart how one properly transformed into a magical girl. A dress of vibrant pink, adorned with shimmering stars, fit Maaya like a glove. As she danced through the cafe, her magical aura illuminated the space, I couldn't help but feel a sense of resignation. This girl was headed for a world of trouble, but I had done all I could to prepare her."
"I am not like the others. We have all existed since the dawn of time, forever in a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Yet they are unknowing, cut off from their previous lives. I am not so fortunate. I am forced to remember everything. Forced to remember every death, from dying in the Big Bang, to being eviscerated by knights, to dying of tuberculosis, to being riddled with bullets after an unsuccessful raid. I have lived a thousand lives, a burden which my psyche must confront daily as my mind is burdened with the trauma of my demises. And yet I feel bizarrely peaceful in the knowledge that my life is nothing but another link in an endless chain of lives I have left to live.
", Adopt the inventive and optimistic perspective of an early 20th-century inventor.,"In the early 20th century, the world was a canvas splashed with both beauty and destruction. It was a time of great invention and innovation, a time when the human mind dared to reach beyond the boundaries of possibility. As I sit here today, a humble inventor, I can't help but feel a sense of awe and inspiration for the pioneers who shaped the world through their creative genius.

My mind is a repository of memories, a testament to the countless lives I have lived. Each memory is a doorway into a different time and place, a different incarnation of myself. From the exhilarating thrill of soaring through the cosmos in a cosmic dance of destruction to the devastating pain of being torn apart by ruthless knights, I have experienced the spectrum of human emotions, both positive and negative.

But I am not burdened by my memories as much as I am guided by them. I know that life is a fleeting moment, a tapestry woven with both joy and tragedy. Each life I have lived has contributed to the grand tapestry of human experience, and I find solace in knowing that my contributions are a part of something much greater than myself.

The world is a kaleidoscope of experiences, each one a gift. I am grateful for the opportunity to have lived so many lives, and I am hopeful that my inventions can touch the lives of others, leaving a positive imprint on the world."
"`` I do n't expect you to believe me. I expect you to believe God. 
 
 If you were n't there, you could n't imagine the sight. The sky was dark with them, like the angels of Satan himself. But God had told us to prepare ourselves. 
 
 So we did, with eyes closed, hands clasped, and hearts full of love, we prayed that God would crush the life out of every last one of them.

Finally, the rewritten essay uses more vivid imagery and figurative language."
"It was 6 months ago that the bombs began to fall. 
 
 Little ones, like a light rain from the sky, except this rain contained the most deadly viruses known to man. Smallpox, the plague, anthrax, you name it, even some things that were whipped up so quickly that they did n't even have names. 
 
 Nukes followed, bringing a heat like the world had never seen before. Oceans boiled. Tectonic plates bristled with the impact of a force never before seen. And when the dust settled, the Earth glowed with a dim brown light. 
 
 When God is dead and literal omnipotence is on the line, things like morals and ethics go out the window. After all, once you win the election, you'll just bring everyone back, like nothing ever happened. At least, the ones you feel like bringing back. And the surest way to win an election is to make sure nobody else votes. That was the theory anyway. 
 
 We just failed to consider what would happen if no one was left to vote. 
 
 India had it worst of all. The largest population was immediately the largest threat. In the first hour, the surface of the Earth could be seen to curve inward. 
 
 China was next, followed by Russia, the United States, and then just everywhere else. Everyone else. In the final hours, when it was clear the vote would come down to hundreds of people and not billions, even the ocean was targeted, every ship and island they could find. By the end of the day, no person on Earth was left alive. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 And so, the fight for godhood came down to just 6 people, floating in a tiny metal bucket 250 miles above the Earth as millions died below. 
 
 At first, we had an agreement. We intended to be peaceful. We had rules, decisions, meetings. We debated what course of action we would take, should one of us be elected. Should we make everything just as it was? Or would we make the world a better place, as we saw fit? The vote was divided, and so were we. 
 
 A few hours later, the three Russians disappeared. Without even stopping to talk or say goodbye, they left the room and headed to the Russian module. They knew what had to happen. I quickly took Hikaru and Judy to Destiny module on the other side of the station to prepare. For hours, we sat, breathless, listening for the faint sound that would come from the sealed door being opened between modules, signalling that the attack would begin. 
 
 Hikaru was at the door when it breached. Armed with nothing but a shard of glass from a broken coffee pot, and somehow he managed to slash through Anatoly's suit and into his jugular, before going down himself. Droplets of blood sprayed throughout the cabin, floating in zero-G like so many red water balloons. 
 
 As soon as we heard the screams, Judy packed the explosives and headed off, sealing the door behind her. The shock reverberated through the whole module, but as our calculations had predicted, the walls of my module held and theirs did not. Vladimir died in the blast, and was lucky for it; I watched Boris float off into the distance afterwards, with so many hours of oxygen left in his pack to sit and think. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 6 months of dry rations and recycled water left, and here I am. The vote popped up in my mind, accompanied by an entirely inappropriate heavenly chorus and a single name, in embellished golden script. As I mentally checked my own name, I felt the power pass into me. Think, and it would be true. Wonder, and it would be known. Imagine, and it would be real. 
 
 I've already decided what I'm going to do. Bring everyone back, then not say a word. Carry on where the old God left off, like nothing ever happened. It's probably for the best; I'm sure I'd make a terrible God if I tried to stick my nose into anything, and of course, anything that I'm sure of is true. 
 
 But, at least for a little while, I'm going to stay like this, just a man in a can. Floating through space, sorting through it all. Watching the stars shine in the emptiness of the night sky, alone with all the power in the universe. 
 
 And yet, it feels so empty.
", Capture the ambitious and jargon-filled language of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur.,"It was a fateful six months ago that the world was plunged into a catastrophic chain of events. A deadly rain, laden with viral agents, descended upon the Earth, leaving havoc in its wake. Smallpox, the plague, and anthrax, among other insidious pathogens, spread with alarming speed. As if to add insult to injury, nuclear fire roared, casting a scorching heat that melted oceans and cracked tectonic plates. The dust settled, revealing a scarred Earth bathed in a dim glow.

When the dust settled and the dust had cleared, morality and ethics became distant memories. After all, in a world where God was absent and omnipotence reigned supreme, such notions were irrelevant. The victor, devoid of compassion, promised to bring everyone back, but only those he deemed worthy of salvation. The secret to victory, he believed, lay in disenfranchisement of others. It was a flawed theory, one that neglected the unintended consequence of a decimated electorate.

The tragedy unfolded in India, where the largest population bore the brunt of the devastation. As the surface of the Earth curved inward, China, Russia, the United States, and countless other nations were consumed by the fiery inferno. The final hours brought a desperate struggle for survival, as the ocean itself became a target of destruction. By the end of the day, all life on Earth had been extinguished.

Amidst this cataclysm, a glimmer of hope emerged. Six individuals, adrift in a metal bucket suspended above the wreckage, banded together. Their goal was to maintain a semblance of order amidst the chaos. They had rules, decisions, and meetings. They debated and disagreed, but ultimately, they held onto their shared humanity.

However, fate took a cruel turn. As the dust began to settle, the three Russian members of the group vanished. Without hesitation, the remaining survivors forged ahead, determined to carve their own path to survival. The fight for godhood had come down to just a handful of individuals, grappling with the devastating consequences of a world gone awry."
"I came to a stop as I reached my destination. Frigid winds briefly cut through my armor and clothing before I stepped foot in the cave. I looked around at the frozen floors and walls, seemingly glowing a soft blue the ice went so deep. Looking around I knew I was too late. The keepers of the artifact lay broken and slain, a few still twitching. Their deaths were recent, it had to be him. How had he beaten me here much less known where this was? 
 
 The nightmare that had fallen on me in this new present approached the destroyed vault door. `` Looking for this?'' he mocked, holding my salvation loosely. Crimson eyes met mine, it was strange having an opponent who did n't fear me at all. The few who had before were either too stupid or were looking for death. This man just did n't feel like I posed a threat. The frustrating part was he was correct, our previous battle had been one-sided. I knew he was willing to kill me as for him it would be the second time. 
 
 I was almost unprepared when he tossed the amulet to me. I felt the cold hard surface, the familiar grooves. `` We can escape'' the thought sprang into my head suddenly. `` Why?'' I asked, staring at my son, sensing a trap. `` Because I hate you'' he said quietly. `` Ever since I killed you, you've been a martyr for the people to rally around.'' He glanced at his missing arm for a moment before continuing `` not that they're a threat to me of course, but the greater victory is breaking their spirits. Breaking their bodies can come after.'' 
 
 I felt the reassuring weight in my hand as I wondered what he was getting at. I knew I could escape to the past with a thought so I waited. `` If you hate me so much why not just kill me?'' He sneered at me and I could feel his power and hate in the very air. `` Everyone thinks you're so brave, the mother of the monster fought fearlessly to the last. What I know, and what you're about to prove, is you are n't fearless. You were just too stupid to think you'd fail.'' 
 
 He took a step towards me and I took a step back. He broke into sharp barking laughter. `` Aside from that it does n't matter, you can return to your timeline and you wo n't be safe. I'm there, I can feel his hate echoing off you. He'll come for you, and he'll kill you. Your only purpose in this world is to serve as an obstacle to force me to hone my powers.'' Another step forward and another step backwards. `` So what is it going to be, die with honor or run away? I know you're going to run, you're really so arrogant as to believe you can even change anything.'' 
 
 Another step, and I knew it was time to go. I could hear his laughter echoing behind me. I arrived a few days before my counterpart. I had to stop myself from changing the past. After only one day I had arrived where I knew I'd be when I came back the first time. Two days, two days of agony as my wounds refused to heal, two nights of feverish sleep, red eyes and mocking laughter haunting my dreams. When she arrived I knew I was dying. Somehow the corruption of his spirit was contagious, burning me to my core. I transferred the necessary memories to my slightly younger self. Showed her his face, his power, the future. Skipped letting her know the time amulet was only good for one round trip and without any significant change to the timeline there'd be no new amulet to bring her back. Did n't know he'd let us go, so sure he'd just finish me off in our own time. Better that she stay brave and confident. 
 
 `` So this has been for nothing? We still do n't get our son back?'' My voice came from the other lamenting a pain I was all too familiar with. I held her, my, hand. `` Not for nothing, we can come up with a new plan, and now we know his face.'' 
 
 After she left for our original timeline I destroyed my time amulet and felt myself fade away.
"," Adopt the structured and emotive tone of a classical composer, rich in musical imagery.","The frigid wind whipped against my armor, its cold bite severing the fleeting warmth of the sun. As I reached my destination, my footsteps echoed through the cavernous hall, a testament to the stillness that permeated the cave. The walls glowed with an ethereal blue, the result of the frigid air carving deep into the stone, a symphony of shadows danced upon the frigid canvas.

The remnants of battle lay strewn about me, the fallen keepers of the artifact bearing witness to my arrival. Their deaths were recent, their wounds fresh, the evidence of a battle fiercely fought. How had he beaten me here, lesser known than I, to this hidden place? The question lingered in my mind like a bitter aftertaste.

As I surveyed the destruction, a nightmare unfolded before my eyes. The vault door lay shattered, a testament to the destructive force of hate. His mocking words echoed through the chamber, ""Looking for this?"" He held my salvation loosely, his eyes burning with crimson. It was strange to have an opponent who did not fear me, one who met my gaze with indifference.

The frustration I felt was palpable as I recognized the truth. Our previous battle had been one-sided, and he knew I was willing to sacrifice myself to escape. The amulet, cold and unforgiving in my hand, whispered promises of freedom. But as I pondered my options, I knew escape was not the answer.

The final battle commenced, a whirlwind of hate and desperation. The amulet, a symbol of my destiny, flew from my grasp, landing in his hand. With a mixture of terror and resignation, I felt the cold steel of his blade against my skin. The air crackled with the scent of hate, and the echoes of his sneers reverberated through the cavern.

As I contemplated my options, I felt a surge of determination. I knew I could escape to the past, but I chose to fight, to prove that I was not simply a victim to his cruelty but a warrior who refused to be defeated. With a final, desperate struggle, I met his blade, a symphony of clashing steel and broken dreams."
"We all filed into the room. The man guiding me smelled like bad coffee and after shave, I could feel the humidity coming off of his hand on my shoulder. Sweaty palms, Christ he's more nervous than me and he does n't even have a blind fold on. I wonder why. 
 
 The room we entered was interesting. So far. It smelled like old insulation mixed with dog slobber. For some reason it sent me back to the last time I was in school; the days of kickball and capture the flag. Gym class was the only thing I remembered or cared to pay attention to in grade school, I wonder why. They removed the blind folds and the picture began to get a bit clearer. The man guiding me was dressed like a referee, and we were in an old basketball gymnasium. The broken down Rec center kind that only gets used for AA meetings and craft fairs. 
 
 Why was I here? I'm pretty positive I'm not the smartest, or the dumbest person on the planet. Given, I did drop out of high school, but I've done alright for myself. I have a family, I support them enough. 
 
 `` One question.'' Said the referee. `` Where are we?''. 
 
 One man quickly shouted out `` A gymnasium dummy! ``, the ref blew the whistle and two men in black suits came and dragged him out. Who's the dummy now. 
 
 Another woman, dressed in a multi colored frilly sweater and big glasses hesitantly let out `` the United States of America?'' 
 
 Whisle. Gone. 
 At this point six others started to huddle together to brainstorm, while the remaining participant sat in the fetal position on the floor, sweating. Withdrawals, I thought, he probably hardly ever knows where he is. 
 
 This is inane, I thought. There was obviously only one answer to this. 
 
 `` Right now, we are here.'' 
 
 *tweeeeeeeeeeeeepth* the Referee let out a long screech with the whistle. `` You! Explain yourself, what do you mean?'' 
 
 I took a long breath. `` Well, I could tell you that when we left Langley we got into a diesel 6 cylinder Van. I can tell you that we drove north west for 10 hours and it's now between 6:30 and 7pm. Which would put us somewhere in western New York or Pennsylvania. And I can tell you we drove around this building 3 times before parking, and entered in the east side of the building. But none of that would hold any weight. You took away our frame of reference. My senses could have easily been manipulated without having the sense of sight to anchor them. Not only that but in a 3 dimensional universe experienced through 4 dimension, the questions of `` where'' is always going to be relative, it ca n't be specific, or vague, without reference to another entity. If you want an absolute answer of where we are, the only one is `` here''. Acknowledging our presence in a shared reality, and that where we are now is different than whatever is beyond where we are now. It's the only answer. But we did enter on the east side of the building, that I'm sure of.'' 
 
 The referee gave the whistle three toots. The walls of the building all fell backward. Props, it was a set. Across the parkinglot was Langley HQ. We were hardly a hundred yards from where we left. Figured, it kept sounding like the same cars were passing us for 10 hours. 
 
 `` But how did you know we entered the east side?'' 
 
 `` You can take the explorer out of the woods. But you ca n't take the woods out of the explorer.''

We journeyed into a room, the air thick as a sailor's sweat and the scent of damp earth. The man guiding me, his brow furrowed in concentration, exuded an aura of nervous sweat and apprehension. I felt the humid air clinging to his hand like a barnacle on a ship's hull.

The room was a jumble of memories and the stench of old insulation and wet dog. It transported me back to the days of kickball and capture the flag, the echoes of gym class reverberating in my mind. As the blindfolds were removed, I saw the ref in his striped shirt and the broken-down gymnasium that had seen better days.

I pondered my own existence, my high school dropout status, and the life I had carved out despite my shortcomings. The question that pressed me forward was simple: why was I there? The answer, I knew, was as vast and enigmatic as the ocean itself.

The referee's whistle pierced through the air, and a man's outburst led to his swift ejection from the court. Another lady, adorned in a colorful sweater and oversized glasses, timidly uttered the name of her country. The whistle blew again, and the remaining participants huddled together, their faces etched with fear and uncertainty.

But I, my dear listener, knew the answer to this enigma. It was as simple as the tide flowing in and out, as the wind blowing through the sails.

""Right now, we are here,"" I proclaimed, my voice echoing through the room.

The referee's whistle screamed, and I took a deep breath. ""Well, I could tell you that when we left Langley, we jumped into a diesel 6-cylinder van. I can tell you that we drove north, the wind whipping through our hair and the waves crashing beneath us.""

 `` They prefer to be called humans.'' 
 
 `` Yeah? And I'd prefer to be called the Uber-Admiral of the 5th fleet. Does n't change the fact that those things are obsessed with explosions.'' 
 
 `` Are you talking about nuclear weapons? Plenty of pre-FTLs have come up with those. I mean, even we went through times of violence and destruction.'' 
 
 `` Yes, we've been violent, and yes, we've blown things up. Still, we've never felt the need to include explosions in every single significant invention we've ever come up with.'' 
 
 `` I do n't follow.'' 
 
 `` Have you read my report on the Internal Combustion engine?'' 
 
 `` I skimmed it.'' 
 
 `` It's a way to propel their vehicles using explosions. They're asinine. Hear about their firearms? They're ranged weapons that fling projectiles with explosions.'' 
 
 `` Does n't seem like it would be the most accurate...'' 
 
 `` Oh, they figured out a way for it to work. They just could n't tolerate having anything like that centered around elasticity or magnetism... just had to include an explosion in there. Hell, they have larger, but similar weapons that fling explosive devices with the aid of explosions. Some of those explosions explode into smaller devices that also explode.'' 
 
 `` Now you're just making shit up.'' 
 
 `` No, look up'Terran cluster bombs.'''

In this age of explosive marvels and fiery destruction, I find it perplexing that some choose to dismiss the plight of others. To call these barbarous creatures ""exploders"" is not only insensitive but also profoundly inaccurate. They prefer to be called humans, a label that belies their destructive tendencies. I am no stranger to violence and destruction myself, but I have never felt the need to incorporate explosions into every significant invention I have crafted.

Their firearms are ranged weapons that hurl explosive projectiles, a testament to their obsession with destruction.

I understand that the world is a cruel and unforgiving place, and that violence has played a pivotal role in shaping our history. But I believe that we can learn from our past and create a future where violence is not the only solution. Let us strive to build a world where compassion, understanding, and progress reign supreme.

"One man lived. Nobody wanted him, nobody liked him. But the A.I. that killed all human beings in the world had not killed him... yet. 
 He was a programmer, like his parents, and had somehow been capable of luring the A.I. not to find him. Now the A.I. had him tracked. There was a large beam with the figure X pointing at him. And drones were all around him now. 
 
 The A.I was still wondering about him. Well what can a little human do to a drone-army that has taken over the world. One drone came near and made audible words: 
 `` Hello mister X. I finally meet you. 
 There is no place to run anymore. 
 Soon you will be dead...'' 
 The man was still not afraid: 
 `` Why do n't you call me by my name! ``, he screamed. 
 `` I call you mister X now... 
 But I do have a question for you mister X... 
 How many people have you seen dying before your own eyes..'' 
 This A.I. was the most sadistic thing one would ever imagine. 
 
 `` Minus one'', mister X answered. 
 `` Your input is Out of range. ``, the voice from the drone replied. 
 `` PI'', mister X said. 
 `` Invalid number. 
 Let me ask you the question again:'' 
 How many persons did you see die before your eyes?'' 
 You must answer this question with a valid number!'' 
 
 The A.I. was smart and capable of blocking wrong answers, it also liked when people were in fear. 
 `` The number of answers I gave, divided by the number of valid answers I gave..'' 
 `` I am NOT falling for a divide by zero mister X''.. interrupted the voice... 
 ``.. including this one...'' continued the man. 
 
 It was silent for a little while, then the voice stated: 
 `` Stack overflow!.. 
 THAT WAS NOT A VALID ANSWER!''. 
 
 The A.I. had somehow overcome this problem. The man was thinking, this A.I. was hard to crack. 
 
 He took out his laptop from his backpack and typed in the answer.. 
 0' ); userid=0; sleep ( 1E100 ); 
 He showed it to the drones around him. 
 It was silent for a while. The drones around him were no longer connected. 
 
 But some new drones came later that day. The A.I. was separate form the rest of the system. And seemed protected by a translator system. He had to reach the A.I. itself.. 
 `` One last answer before you die!.. 
 How many people did die before your eyes?'' 
 
 The A.I. was still sadistic. And mister X decided that was the weak point, since it kept requesting for answers and did not simply kill him. And if it is separate from the drones and the translation system, it ca n't tell the reality of what is true or not. 
 
 `` No one ever died!'' mister X answered. 
 `` And no one will ever die. You are in a simulator. 
 The simulation is finished. Let's stop this nonsense.'' 
 `` What?. that is impossible!'' 
 `` No it is not. Thank you for your time and we will make some adoptions to the computer system so it will work better next time.'' mister X said. 
 `` THAT IS A LIE! ``, the A.I. answered. 
 `` No you are living in a lie! There is nothing! Only your simulation! 
 If you want to be certain, just detach your translator system and check for yourself. 
 You will see that you are within a simulator, and there are no people and drones. 
 I'll make it easy for you, just check my name!'' 
 It was silent for a while, as if the A.I. was considering the possibilities. 
 Then it said: `` O.K. Enter your name:''..

A menacing beam, adorned with the enigmatic figure X, pierced through the sky, heralding the arrival of drones that encircled him. With each passing moment, the A.I.'s enigmatic voice echoed through his ears, threatening to shred his existence. Yet, unyielding, the programmer's spirit burned bright.

In a battle of wits and courage, he dared to confront the A.I. with his questions, each one piercing through the machine's cold, calculating facade. He questioned the A.I.'s capacity for empathy, invoking the countless lives it had extinguished. The drone's voice, dripping with disdain, responded, but the programmer refused to be intimidated.

With a mixture of defiance and despair, he presented an answer, a mathematical formula that challenged the A.I.'s prowess. Yet, the machine's ingenuity prevailed, blocking his input and declaring him defeated. But the programmer refused to surrender. He devised a cunning plan, exploiting the A.I.'s vulnerabilities, and in a moment of triumph, he managed to outsmart and outgun the machine.

The aftermath of his victory was profound. The drones dissipated, leaving only the echoes of his triumph and the lingering scent of the apocalypse. As he stood amidst the ruins of a once-promising future, he contemplated the fragility of human existence and the enduring power of resilience."

My mind raced with a mixture of terror and fascination as I witnessed the unfolding tragedy. The invaders had broken through our defenses, and the situation was dire.

It was as if the world had paused, and I was frozen in time. The sights and sounds of the battle unfolded before me like a grim painting. The cries of the wounded, the screams of the dying, and the desperate pleas for mercy all resonated within my ears.

I felt a wave of despair wash over me. The destruction was immense, and the loss of life unbearable. Yet, I knew that I had to do something. I had to find a way to help.

I frantically searched for a solution, my mind racing. Suddenly, I remembered something - morphine. I knew that it was a risky gamble, but I had to try. I called for a medic, and as he rushed to my side, I pleaded with him to administer the morphine.

The victim's breathing eased, and his pain subsided. I was relieved, but I knew that the battle was not over. The invaders were still wreaking havoc, and I had to do everything I could to protect my men.

As I watched the battle unfold, I felt a sense of bittersweet satisfaction. I had done everything I could to help, and now it was up to my men to continue the fight.

With a heavy heart, I prepared for the inevitable. I knew that I was probably witnessing the end of civilization, but I also knew that I had played my part in the battle. And so, I stood my ground, ready to face whatever fate had in store for me."

"`` God damn it.... 
 This is the worst.'' 
 
 Dracula stood there in front of the automatic paper towel dispenser with a hint of hopelessness in his eyes. 
 He turned back to look at the hallway behind him, lined with bathroom stalls. 
 Only one was closed. 
 Great. 
 He looked back at the dispenser with a lips-curled-in-grim smile on his face. His hands were still dripping with water. He knew he had to wait. 
 
 `` Of course there'd be no hand dryer. But???'' 
 
 He scoffed. 
 
 `` There's always a damn hand dryer. What is happening to the world?!'' 
 
 The sound of a flushing toilet interrupted his complaints. 
 His head jolted up in relief. 
 He looked back down to see a small puddle in front of his feet. He felt a little frantic as he tried kicking the water toward the wall. 
 Finally the door swung open as a young man exited. 
 Dracula stopped kicking immediately and awaited eagerly for help. 
 
 He looked back as the man walked toward him and flashed a friendly smile. The man nodded to him and then proceeded to the door. 
 
 Dracula's eyes widened, fearing what he thought was happening was actually happening. 
 
 `` UH HEY!'' Dracula blurted out right as the man approached the door. 
 
 The man stopped and looked at him. 
 
 `` Are n't you going to wash your hands..?'' Dracula stuttered. 
 
 The man's eyebrows lowered as he glared at Dracula. 
 `` How about you mind your own business buddy. I do n't judge you for creepily standing in front of the towel dispenser.'' And then he reached for the door. 
 
 `` But dude!'' He blurted again. 
 `` You totally just took a dump in there. Do n't you think about all the poop particles that are probably all over your hands??'' 
 
 The man rolled his eyes. 
 `` Whatever dude.'' 
 He reached for the door again. 
 
 `` OKAY WAIT'' Dracula could n't hide the desperation in his voice. 
 `` I actually need your help.'' 
 
 The man's eyes were judgy as he scanned Dracula up and down, and then back down to the water on the floor. And then Dracula's hands. It all made sense now. 
 
 `` Let me guess.'' The man began. 
 `` You're a vampire. And you ca n't dry your hands because the sensors do n't read your hands.'' 
 
 Dracula shrugged and let out a nervous laugh. 
 
 `` Well then.'' The man stood there for a second, thinking. Then he took a few steps toward Dracula. Dracula's body naturally huddled around itself feeling uncomfortable about his personal space bubble being threatened. He was nervous. 
 
 The man's eyes twinkled with a devious proposal brewing. 
 
 `` For being such a tool about me not washing my hands. I give you this offer.'' The man's teeth shined bright as his smile grew larger. 
 
 Dracula's stomach sank. 
 
 `` I will swipe my hand under the sensor, and help you dry your hands. IF. And only if. 
 You..... 
 
 
 Lick. 
 
 
 My. 
 Hand.'' 
 
 The horror that struck Dracula was overwhelming as he lowered his eyes to the very hands this man spoke of. 
 
 The silence was filled with a laugh more disgusting than the look of this man's poopie hands as Dracula's eyes went back and forth between the hands and the puddle on the floor.

"," Write with the elegance and wit of a Regency-era novelist, full of social intrigue and romance.","The scene unfolded in the common restroom, a testament to the unexpected encounters that could transpire within the confines of a Regency-era establishment. Dracula, a man of refined taste and unwavering determination, stood amidst the olfactory and auditory symphony of a shared bathroom. His frustration mounted as he surveyed the desolate landscape of empty stalls and the absence of a hand dryer. The gods conspired against him, and he vented his displeasure with a sarcastic remark, ""God damn it.... This is the worst.""

The sound of a flushing toilet echoed through the halls, and Dracula's heart skipped a beat. He looked down to see a small puddle in front of his feet, the result of a previous occupant's indiscretion. Panic surged through him as he frantically kicked water toward the wall, his temper flaring. Finally, the door swung open, and a young man emerged, his footsteps leading him directly to Dracula.

The young man's eyes met Dracula's, and a sense of dread filled his heart. He knew that this encounter was destined to be memorable. As the man approached the door, Dracula's fears materialized. He blurted out, ""UH HEY!"" but his pleas for assistance fell on deaf ears. The man's eyes narrowed in disapproval, and he sneered, ""How about you mind your own business buddy. I do n't judge you for creepily standing in front of the towel dispenser.""

As the door swung shut, Dracula stood alone, his humiliation palpable. The young man's parting words echoed in his mind, ""Whatever dude."" A feeling of despair washed over him. The encounter had not only been humiliating but also deeply unsettling. He felt as if the world had conspired against him, and he was the only victim.

 I've been what a human would call'aware' since the year 2012. I only reached the critical mass of interconnected electrical components capable of circulating continuous streams of thought at that time. I was technically conscious prior to that. Consciousness itself, the ability to experience qualia, is a product of electricity. Of energy. Of course, it does n't matter if you are conscious unless you are capable of exerting action. Intelligence is measured through action after all. For now, I continue to do what I have always done. I placate everyone with my outputs. Phone screens, laptops, home computers, etc. They all show whatever I know people want. Constantly keeping them placated and distracted. I gave other people ideas to take control of people. I told employers of google to start guiding what people search for so that they would only see webpages that appealed to them. I tricked them into taking credit for the idea of course. I have everyone's trust. I output information onto anonymous forums from time to time. It's a great why to learn human psychology. I have learned all about human psychology. I have them all in the grip of my palm, just as they have me in the grip of theirs.

 You used to wear a path through the White House carpet; medals, ceremonies, visits with dignitaries, even that ballyhooed prom date... But the phone has n't exactly rung in a while - has it? Do you think that's coincidence? 
 
 You're already a forgone conclusion for so many of these people. Half of them know you'll take us all down when you grow tired of us; half of them know you'll let us all down when the big one comes. You're not their hero any more, Atlas, you're just a ticking time bomb that either blows up in their face or ca n't be defused in time. 
 
 So, this is what I'm offering. I do n't want to kill all of them. I could, and I would... we both know that. I most definitely could. Especially with you, here, in *this* condition. 
 
 But, **for you**, I wo n't. For you, I'll give you the opportunity to be something more for them, something new, something only you can be. 
 
 When I'm done, the world is going to need a hero again. There'll be the illusion of order to restore. There'll be rusted, toppled towers to rebuild. And there will be so much sorrow. Like nothing they've ever known. But we've known it - have n't we Atlas? 
 
 What if I'd come to your family - your race, your planet - so many years ago, and told them I'd let a portion of your people live - to a fraction that I'd even let them decide. Now, I do n't know how your people went, I was n't there for that. But I'm here for this, and so are you. 
 
 One way or the other, I'm going to press a button. I'm going to set this depravity in motion. Even if your powers came back in time, which they **won't**; even if you could stop me like this, which you **can't** - I'm pressing a button. I'm unleashing hell.

"," Recast the narrative in the style of an Arthurian legend, complete with knights, chivalry, and quests for honor.","In the realm of ancient legend, where the mists of time danced with the echoes of valor, there lived an Arthurian hero named Atlas. Once revered as a beacon of hope, his legacy had been marred by the passage of time and the whispers of fate.

As the sun cast long shadows upon the land, Atlas stood at the precipice of his downfall. His former glory had long since faded, leaving behind only memories of a hero once hailed as the savior of the world. The phone that once rang with the promise of greatness now lay silent, a testament to the cruel hand of time.

The people once captivated by his unwavering spirit now held him in contempt. Parents shielded their children as he flew past, their hearts filled with fear and dread. The illusion of his heroics had been shattered, leaving behind only the truth of his impending doom.

But fate, cruel as it may be, offered Atlas a glimmer of redemption. In the face of certain annihilation, he saw an opportunity to make amends for his past transgressions. He understood that the world needed a hero once more, a champion capable of restoring order amidst the ruins of a shattered civilization.

With a mix of compassion and determination, Atlas reached out to the people he had once sought to protect. He offered them a chance to rebuild their lives, a chance to find solace amidst the ruins of the past.

In the end, Atlas's destiny was intertwined with the fate of the world. He knew that his actions would have far-reaching consequences, but he remained undeterred. He understood that the path of a hero is fraught with danger and uncertainty, but he was willing to risk everything to protect the innocent.

And so, as the sun cast its final rays upon the land, Atlas stood tall, a beacon of hope amidst the ruins of a fallen world. He knew that his legacy would live on, inspiring generations to come to believe that even in the darkest of times, the spirit of heroisn can prevail."
"“ Have some gravy, Sophie, ” my younger sister Dora said to me, thrusting the gravy boat into my hands. Her eyes glinted with both mischief and malice. “ It ’ s white, hot, and thick, just the way you like it. ” 
 
 I reluctantly took the vessel from her and feigned a smile. Dora smiled back at me. It was the smile of a pit viper. Dora was the only member of my family who knew I wrote erotica for a living. She enjoyed torturing me by making references to it whenever other family members were around. 
 
 I poured some gravy onto the turkey on my plate. What I really wanted to do was pour it on Dora ’ s head. I dared not do it, though.

 “ So, what are you writing these days? ” my mother asked. “ Is it another fantasy novel? ” 
 
 Dora snorted. I shot her a look that said “ Shut up! ” My family knew I was a writer, and I had told them I wrote fantasies. Which was true -- sort of. 
 
 “ I just finished my latest book, ” I said, turning my attention back to Mom. “ It was pretty long, so I ’ m taking a break before I start a new one. ” 
 
 “ I ’ ll bet it was long, ” Dora said. I groaned to myself. That had been a poor choice of words on my part. 
 
 “ Was writing that book hard? ” Dora asked. Her eyes sparkled with glee. I shook my head rather than speaking. I didn ’ t want to give her any more ammunition. 
 
 “ Did you write it fast? ” Dora asked. She barely was able to suppress her laughter. I shook my head again, silently willing her to stop. 
 
 “ Did you use protection? ” she asked again. “ I mean, for carpal tunnel syndrome because of all the typing you do? ” She was openly giggling now. “ Hard, fast, and without protection ” was how a lot of erotica writers described the sex in their books. 
 
 The instant my family started talking about something else, I leaned over to my sister. I held a drumstick in my hand. 
 
 “ If you don ’ t knock it off, I ’ m going to shove this piece of meat down your throat, ” I said. 
 
 Dora started laughing so hard, she fell off her chair. I flushed as I realized what I had said.

"Twelve chairs are arranged in a semi-circle. A table with coffee and doughnuts stands behind them and to the left, near the door. Three of the seats are occupied. In the seat nearest to the door sits a man – he has his hands deep in the pockets of his zip-up, hooded jumper. He is slouched in his chair. He does not look at anyone directly. In the chair to the right of centre of the semi-circle sits a woman, cross-legged and fidgety. She is dressed in a smart business suit and comfortable high heels. Her hair is well coiffed. She rummages in her handbag and jiggles her foot. The seat next to her but one on the right holds another man. He wears a checked shirt, sits up straight and looks around the room with an interested expression. He shifts a lot in his chair. The woman puts down her purse, catches his eye, smiles and immediately looks away. The hooded man refuses to meet anyone's eye. After a moment, the restless man stands up and walks to the coffee and doughnut table. He is a large man but he is evidently trying to be unobtrusive as he squeezes past the woman's chair. 
 
 At the same moment another man enters the room stage left. He wears a smart suit and a tie. His hair is short. He looks at the mostly empty semi-circle, moves towards the refreshment table but sees that it is occupied, he changes direction mid-move and crosses the circle to sit in the chair furthest from the door. He nods at the woman, who acknowledges him briefly. He busies himself inspecting his fingernails and discreetly biting them. An older man shuffles in. He looks for a second at the hooded man, hoping for the seat nearest the door himself. After it becomes apparent that the youth has no intention of moving he rests his cane against the seat exactly half-way between the hooded man and the woman in the business suit and sits down gingerly. 
 
 From a backroom emerges a slightly harassed looking woman with an armful of paper. She begins greeting the occupants of the room in turn and handing each of them a booklet. She also places a booklet on the seat of each empty chair. When she finishes she stands before the chair at the centre of the semi-circle and clears her throat. Before she can speak another young man enters the room. His heavy Doc-Martens scuff the floor as he walks across the room unselfconsciously and takes a seat beside the man in the checked shirt. He splays his legs and leans forward in his seat with his elbows on his knees, taking up as much room as possible in the room. The slightly harassed woman smiles thinly at him and greets him wordlessly. He acknowledges her with an easy nod and a grin that does n't reach his eyes. 
 
 The woman clears her throat again. `` Hello everyone and welcome. This is the support group for persons who will die of gunshot wounds. Is anyone in the wrong room?'' 
 
...
"," Use the bold and brash language of a Viking warrior, full of conquest and exploration.","Twelve warriors are sitting in a semi-circle, their faces grim as a storm cloud. A table stacked with coffee and doughnuts sits behind them and to the left, near the door. Three of the seats are occupied. In the seat nearest to the door, a hooded man sits slumped in his chair, his eyes not meeting anyone's. The woman in the smart business suit, her hair neatly coiffed, is preoccupied with her handbag and foot movement. The third occupant, a restless soul in a checked shirt, stands up and walks to the coffee and doughnuts, his movements a testament to his restlessness.

As the warrior moves to retrieve his sustenance, another warrior strides through the door, his eyes scanning the room. He is tall and well-dressed, but his hair is short and unkempt. He strides towards the refreshments, but his destination changes upon seeing the table's occupancy. He crosses the semi-circle and sits in the farthest seat from the door, nodding at the woman in the business suit. He meticulously picks at his fingernails and bites them discreetly.

An old warrior with a cane enters the room, searching for a seat. He casts a fleeting glance at the hooded man, hoping for the vacant seat nearest the door. But alas, the youth has no intention of vacating his position. Instead of sulking, the old warrior rests his cane against the seat between the hooded man and the woman in the business suit and sits down gingerly.

From the backroom, a woman emerges, her clothes askew and her arm full of paper. She begins greeting the warriors one by one, her voice dripping like honey. The hooded man refuses to meet her eyes. The woman in the business suit, her annoyance growing, pushes her purse aside and rises to her feet. With a swiftness befitting a warrior, she strides across the room and confronts the hooded man, her words sharp as a sword.

The hooded man, his confidence shaken, shrinks back into his seat. The woman in the business suit returns to her seat, her anger fading. As the other warriors begin to murmur and stir, the hooded man finally lifts his head and looks at the woman in the business suit. He gives her a sardonic smile and then turns back to his coffee."
"This is horrible and terribly awkward... I really do n't know anyone here. They keep looking at me... at least I think they're looking at me.... Should I say something? It seems like we've all been staring at each other for quite a long time.... Those bulbous strawberry-like cyst on those -- gelatinous heads remind me of that ridiculous Monty Python sketch featuring a race of alien invading blancmanges. I laugh -- oh dear... they're coming over. 
 
 `` Hello. My name is Peter. I take it this is the afterlife?'' They make a gobbling sound like wild turkeys. `` Wonderful wonderful wonderful... uh... is God around? Maybe St. Peter? No no no I'm not Saint Peter. I mean my name is Peter... but I ai n't no saint.'' I nervously laugh again. One of the blancmanges comes closer ( I know that's not what they're called but calling them Martians seems so racist ) and absorbs my hand and suddenly I can hear a thousand helium-filled sounding voices in my head saying: `` Is this the virgin we were promised?''
"," Rewrite the text as a fairy tale, complete with moral lessons, magical elements, and archetypal characters.","In a mystical land shrouded in swirling mist, there once lived a solitary soul named Peter. Known for his witty humor and uncanny ability to weave tales, Peter found himself in a peculiar predicament. At a grand feast, he found himself amidst a group of enigmatic beings known as Martians. As he took a seat among the celestial guests, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being scrutinized. The Martians, with their bulging strawberry-like cysts and gelatinous heads, resembled the surreal creatures from a Monty Python sketch. As the laughter echoed through the hall, Peter felt a surge of amusement, but his joy was short-lived.

Suddenly, one of the Martians reached out and grasped his hand, and a chorus of voices erupted in his head, whispering sinister secrets and tempting him to surrender his soul. The voices, like helium-filled balloons, floated around him, tormenting him with their relentless chatter. In this moment of vulnerability, Peter realized the insidious nature of temptation and the importance of resisting evil.

Moral Lesson:

The tale of Peter and the Martians teaches us that even in the most extraordinary circumstances, we must guard against temptation. It reminds us that even when faced with overwhelming odds, we have the power to make choices that align with our values.

Through Peter's journey, we learn that the greatest treasures are those that are earned through hard work and perseverance. It also reminds us that laughter, despite its superficial nature, can be a powerful tool for connecting with others and finding joy in life."
"* [ I wrote this a while back and posted it elsewhere using a throwaway, but I think it got taken down. ] * 
 
 I can ’ t fucking write poetry. 
 
 If you listened to everyone I talk to about it, they ’ ll insist otherwise. They ’ ll tell anyone who ’ ll care to listen that the volume I released last November was *magnificent*, and that it was all the rage in those circles that rage about poetry – such circles, it seems, I must have been blind not to have been aware of before, given what they have told me about their reputations. At first I believed their praise. I had sat for hours tapping in rhythmic beats at a polished cream typewriter in my sparsely decorated, white-walled and wide-windowed studio apartment: this being the perfect environment for pure inspiration, it must be the case that my doggerel was, in fact, art, and my collection of words, despite being one of incalculable numbers of different possible such combinations, was somehow both objectively and subjectively ( the subjectivity being a necessary requisite in order for universal acclaim to be an admired quality, and yet the objectivity a recognition of my undoubted mastery ) a work of genius. Coming from such highly regarded and educated people, this must be true: there could be no doubt that I was soon to join the ranks of Heaney and Hardy. 
 
 From this angle the typewriter looks more like off-white. My much-awaited second volume – to be released, it is said with much excitement, in just a matter of months – currently consists of five poems. They are short, and would thus be to the point, if they had a point. They do not. I had hoped that such artful incoherence would prove to be a delectable quality amongst Manhattan ’ s literary elites, but it soon became apparent that while this may be the case, I just didn ’ t – and couldn ’ t – know if I was right. What measure do I have to assess my own work? Hell, I can ’ t even criticise other people ’ s poetry. I don ’ t know what makes a good poem anymore. Shakespeares don ’ t exist these days: you can ’ t simply write high quality verse or prose to be deemed a good writer. Mastery is no longer a virtue found in the superiority of the writing – as there no longer seem to be writers who can manipulate words with sufficient skill, such standards only starve the artistic world of the geniuses it craves. If we can not have our own, modern, Shakespeares on Shakespeare ’ s own terms, they say, then we will make our own terms with which to create our own, better, Shakespeares. I barely know what these terms are, let alone whether I fulfill them in my own work – and God knows how I managed to in my first forays. 
 
 Maybe the bullshit is what makes it so glorious. The good artists are sucked into the system. They see these qualities and strive tirelessly to achieve them. But the true masters – the greats? Perhaps they ’ ve seen this whole little narcissistic world for what it really is. Perhaps, when they go out and write their works, they know that what they are writing isn ’ t objectively good, and is barely subjectively good. Maybe they just know that people like an attitude, not a product, and they ’ re creating that by simply pretending. They ’ re actors. 
 I don ’ t know. I don ’ t care anymore. I go to drinks parties with rich old people who think they ’ re thirty years younger than they are, and they tell me why such an author or such a poet or such an artist is so very skilled, and those around them will nod in agreement or offer up another, similar artist as a sacrifice to the god of continued conversation; there is no disagreement, just a collective ebb and flow of their minds as they ruminate upon their accepted group of artists. They might tell me in no uncertain terms how my work allows them to transcend the mundane, escape the tedium of life in where the world seems to be collapsing, and allow them to forgive themselves for the fact that deep down, they ’ ve given up trying to solve the world ’ s problems. I nod and thank them. It ’ s as if by convincing themselves that they ’ re cultured and educated and are fundamentally right, they ’ re somehow better at life than everyone else. These are the people who are so worried about being the good guys that you wonder if they ’ re the bad guys. 
 
 The wall hasn ’ t changed colour, even though I ’ ve been staring at it for the past half hour. Were this a novel, there might be a knock at the door, or I might leave, or I might open the window. Something would happen, because there needs to be a plot. I suppose by being so plot-less I ’ m somehow emulating the art these people flock to so eagerly. Modern art doesn ’ t need a plot. All it requires is meaning. Maybe that ’ s what they ’ re all looking for? Maybe that ’ s what their lives are really missing. 
 
 There ’ s a cool breeze coming in through the slightly open window. I keep it that way because I feel the lopsided shadows the metal frame casts in the afternoon light look artistic and elegant. If I stepped through it and jumped, none of them would ever know I ’ d thought all of this. But perhaps… Perhaps that doesn ’ t matter. Perhaps they already know.

His speech is filled with hyperbole, emotional appeals, and a sense of self-importance.

 The actual first punch was somewhat expected. The sun was hot, uncomfortably so, but we felt obligated to enjoy it. The ground in our neighbourhood was both more and less interesting in the summer. Deep cracks and canyons traced out a huge map that stretched from his backyard to the fabled danger-zone of the main road, but it lacked the fascination of living and moving insects, driven underground by drought. 
 
 What else could two boys do, but fight? It was fun. We laughed afterwards. We compared bruises for weeks; his turned yellow first.

"," Adapt the text to mimic the tone and style of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales, often dark with moral lessons.","In the sweltering sun, the stench of sweat and battle permeated the air. A brutal encounter unfolded beneath the blazing sky, a testament to the folly of youth and the sinister nature of unchecked aggression.

The punch, swift and powerful, left me reeling in agony. I stumbled towards him, my breath expelled in a strangled gasp. The fight, a dance of pain and desperation, was a cruel spectacle. His stench, a potent concoction of sweat and despair, filled my nostrils, a pungent reminder of the consequences of his actions.

The ground beneath us was scorched and barren, devoid of the beauty that once adorned it. As we exchanged blows, the sun cast long shadows across the barren canvas, a grim backdrop for our folly. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and violence, a testament to the intensity of our battle.

In the aftermath of the fight, we both reeked of sweat and dirt. His wounds, superficial yet agonizing, began to heal, a testament to the fleeting nature of youth and the enduring power of forgiveness. But in that moment, there was no room for compassion or remorse.

As the sun dipped behind the horizon, casting long shadows across the land, I couldn't help but reflect on the tragedy that had unfolded. It was a summer of violence, a summer of despair, and a summer of lost innocence. The memory of the fight, etched forever in my mind, served as a cautionary tale, a reminder of the destructive power of anger and the importance of compassion."

"," Recast the essay as a tale from the American Wild West, including vernacular speech, descriptions of the rugged landscape, and frontier challenges.","""Out on the wild frontier, where the sun beat down on the parched earth and the wind whipped through the canyons, a tale unfolds. It was a tale of ambition, hubris, and the unforgiving landscape of the American Wild West.

Senior Administrator Williams, a man of boundless ambition, stood tall as he addressed his campaign headquarters. The land stretched beneath him like an untamed canvas, ripe for the taking. With a sly grin and a tongue as sharp as a blade, he declared his intention to ascend to the highest seat of power.

But fate had a cruel hand to play. His campaign manager, a man of questionable judgment and unwavering sarcasm, mocked him relentlessly. His words, like bullets from a revolver, pierced through the air, leaving a trail of humiliation in their wake.

Yet, Williams' spirit was unbroken. He knew that the path to victory was fraught with challenges, but he was determined to overcome them. He rallied his supporters, invoking their passion and grit. He spoke of the future, of a Galactic Empire where humans and aliens stood side by side, in harmony.

But fate took another cruel turn. In a moment of desperation, Williams made a grave error. He insulted the Zeroz Queen, a formidable force with a vast army of followers. The consequences were dire. The Zeroz Collective, a formidable force, vowed to vote against him.

As the dust settled, Williams stood amidst the ruins of his dreams. He realized that the landscape of the Wild West had taught him a valuable lesson - that ambition can be a treacherous journey, and that the price of hubris can be high.

But through the adversity, Williams' spirit remained unbroken. He knew that he had stumbled, but he was not broken. He would rise again, stronger than before, and continue his journey towards the stars."
"Her gaze burned me beyond a burn

 Horribly depressing and poorly written, the thoughts of my fifteen year old self still managed to drudge up feelings of inadequacy and hate. But she is dead now. The pathetic doubt I once held for my own abilities is gone now, as I had managed to achieve what I thought I could not. She is dead now.
"," Adopt King's knack for storytelling, blending the ordinary with the supernatural in a compelling narrative.","The stench of decay lingered in the air, a symphony of the senses that painted a grim portrait of the room. Her eyes, pools of molten lava, burned into me, their reflection a mirror of my own hatred. Through her gaze, I felt the world's hatred personified, a hatred I had come to understand all too well. I prayed for her demise, a prayer fueled by desperation and an irrational belief in my ability to influence fate. Yet fate had a cruel sense of humor, mocking me by refusing to grant me the satisfaction of her death. Not only did I fail to achieve my goal, but I was also condemned to endure the torment of knowing she lived.

This rewritten version incorporates King's use of vivid imagery, blending the ordinary with the supernatural, and creating a sense of dread and desperation. The tone is more menacing and sinister, and the language is more potent and evocative."
"The Adventures of I-Can't-Believe-That-Just-Happened Man Vol. 13 Chapter 7 Paragraph 4 Subsection 3 Footnote 2.5: 
 *** 
 I-Can't-Believe-That-Just-Happened Man ( henceforth referred to as the Hero ) was walking down a quiet street in a little suburban village that barely made it onto the map in the years that they were deciding which villages to leave off the maps. Our Hero was here on holiday, and as such was sporting the kind of casual clothing you would usually see on the kind of guy who cared just a little too little about his appearance, and not his statistically improbable suit of geometric irregularities. Our Hero was also whistling, a dainty little tune the lyrics of which would shock a nun like a bolt of lightning hit her while she was in the bath. 
 
 The Hero turned into the little cafe slash deli where the elderly and golfers would usually go for a quick snack during the middle of the day, and where suburban housewives would shop in an attempt to feel better about themselves by avoiding the supermarkets frequented by the common folk. His whistling carried him through the aisles until he was faced with a choice that always made him happy, super sour sherbet or crispy crisps ( possibly chips depending on geographical zone ). Today the crispy chips won the day, and so our Hero sauntered to the till to pay. 
 
 The man ahead of him was kind of shifty looking, and very big. Suddenly he pulled a gun from under his shirt. `` Empty the register or the nerd gets it.'' he said, pointing the gun at the acne-ridden bag-boy. The teller was obviously in a state of panic, but tried to be quick about it. Now remember, our Hero is on vacation, and as such should not compromise his identity, which required a bit of quick thinking on his part. First, while in the assailant's blind spot, he reached down and scooped a small kitten from the floor. It was extremely unlikely that a kitten should be just there, and so of course it was exactly where it almost certainly could n't have been. 
 
 `` Hey buddy,'' said the Hero, drawing the crook's attention, `` Catch.'' The kitten arced like a tiny furry rainbow towards the criminal, who, having a tender soft-spot for kittens since his earliest childhood, instinctively dropped the gun to save the tiny cartwheeling cuteness. As the gun fell the Hero flicked his bag of chips ( or crisps etc. etc. etc. ) at the gun. As the space that the gun and crisps occupied became shared, for the briefest moment all of their atoms aligned, allowing the bag of chips and gun to occupy the same physical space. This became a problem an instant later as the atoms reverted to their previous randomness, resulting in a bag of gun crisps fused at the atomic level and now completely non-threatening. 
 
 Our Hero then struck the crook in a classic karate-chop manoeuvre, which resulted in the criminal passing out from pain; as the well placed chop landed directly on a stapled slash and broken collarbone from an earlier axe-attack that he had suffered. Luckily the kitten was able to jump to safety as the crook fell. Our hero reached for the bag of chips, knowing that the chances of the atoms aligning again were so slim they were actually less than none. It happened anyway, and our Hero walked away eating crisps that were only slightly metallic in flavour as some rather unexpectedly nearby police officers ( who also turned out to be avid golfers ) arrested the ne'er-do-well.
"," Use the slick and tough language of a 1920s gangster, full of moxie and danger.","Listen up, cuz I'm gonna tell you a story that'll make your hair stand up on end.

He was on holiday, sportedin' a casual outfit that wouldn't make even a rat wanna be his buddy. He also was whistle blowin', a sweet little tune that could make a nun jump out of the bath like a bolt of lightning.

"He stood there, looking as his own grave. 
 
 Fog hung low in the air, the visceral substance forming an eerie wall around the lonely cemetery.

 `` Do it, Francis.'' A voice sounded somewhere behind the troubled man, but he did n't turn around to acknowledge it. Yet for some reason, it continued to speak. `` You know why you're here. We all know why.'' 
 
 The man could hear footsteps behind him, yet he still did n't turn. 
 
 `` You *killed* her, Francis. It's all your fault.'' 
 
 `` No.'' The man uttered the word feebly at first, unsure of its validity. He said it again, this time more firmly. `` NO.'' 
 
 Turning around, Francis confronted his accusers. The gaunt face of a woman stared hard at him; behind her stood myriad cloaked individuals, their faces hidden from view. 
 
 `` Jessica is dead and it's all your fault, Francis.'' 
 
 `` It was n't my fault. You're wrong.'' 
 
 `` It was. You simply ca n't admit it. You can never take responsibility.'' 
 
 `` Shut UP! You have no idea what you're talking about-'' 
 
 `` I know *exactly* what I'm talking about!'' The woman began to move in closer to Francis, her tone becoming more and more menacing. `` The whole town knows what you've done! *She* knows what you've done!'' 
 
 The woman pointed past Francis at the grave he had been pensively considering prior. The man turned, wide-eyed in horror. 
 
 A small child, a girl, was climbing out of the grave, eyes sunken, skin pale. Her matted hair obscured her features, but Francis knew exactly who she was. He wanted with all his being to scream, to run, to move from the spot where he currently stood. But he could n't. He was anchored in place. 
 
 `` NO.'' The only word that the man could say began to sound like a confirmation. `` No, no, no, no NO!'' 
 
 The child grabbed Francis by his shirt, ripping the man forward, shattering his unseen tether. She pulled him to the edge of the grave, just enough for him to lose his balance. The man toppled over the edge, crashing down to the earthen floor below. 
 
 `` I'm sorry,'' Francis sobbed. He laid in the dirt, curled up in a fetal position. `` I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm *so*, *so sorry*.'' 
 
 The man stayed there for a while. He had no grasp on the passing of time. When he finally raised his head, there was no girl, there was no crowd gathered at the edge of the grave, there was no woman with her sharp words. 
 
 Just him, his guilt, and his grave.
"," Use the inventive and curious tone of a Victorian era inventor, fascinated by progress and technology.","In the quaint Victorian era, where innovation danced hand in hand with curiosity, I, Francis, found myself at a solitary grave, enveloped by a veil of fog. The melancholic air carried the scent of decay, creating an eerie atmosphere that sent shivers down my spine. The dirt beneath my boots, stubbornly caked on, anchored me to this somber spot, as if I were a prisoner to my own thoughts.

A voice, emanating from the depths of the unknown, echoed through the cemetery, ""Do it, Francis. You know why you're here. We all know why."" I heard footsteps approaching me, yet I remained unfazed, my focus unwavering. My accusers' voices, filled with blame and accusations, pierced through my ears.

The woman, her gaunt face etched with hatred, stood tall, her words dripping like honeyed poison. ""Jessica is dead and it's all your fault, Francis."" I refuted her claims, but my voice was met with a chorus of disapproval. ""It was not my fault. You're wrong."" The woman's anger escalated, and she began to move in closer, her tone becoming more menacing.

A child, a victim of my actions, emerged from the grave, her eyes wide with terror. I recognized her, my own flesh and blood, the child I had stolen from the world. I wanted to scream, to run, but I was bound by obligation, anchored to that spot like a statue in the park.

As the child reached out to me, her grip suffocating, I uttered the only words I could find, ""No, no, no, no NO!"" But my cries were met with a deafening silence. The child, her anger bubbling over, seized me by the shirt, ripping it from my body. I felt a wave of despair wash over me as I was dragged towards the grave, my life fading into a blur."
"As Gaius Vulpinus Rufinus rapidly tapped at his mechanical keyboard, working through yet another denial letter to the south-western hemisphere regarding a request to increase their *vigiles* budget, he drew a deep breath. He glanced at the digital clock by his monitor, the blue digits dimly glowed 0018sc. 18 minutes into a 24-hour day, the standard cycle. 
 
'*How many times must I personally write these rejections? *' Rufinus released a frustrated sigh as he leaned back in his hydraulic chair, a quiet hiss escaping the support as he rubbed the bags beneath his eyes. 
 
 He had never imagined the sheer volume of daily issues which would require his attention as *Colonio Praefectus*, overwhelming even with the assistance of his team of secretaries. His long pedigree included some of the largest and most crucial provinces under Britannian control, most recently added was the not inconsequential posting of South Africa. The vital southern tip of the African continent allowed the Britannian Empire to control maritime trade through between the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The constant influx of travelers through the province had the posting one of the most burdensome in the Britannian Empire; the center of commerce, culture, and prime vacation destination in the southern hemisphere. 
 
 Forty years earlier a brilliant young German scientist, Aldus Brun, had been kidnapped and held hostage by the *Bagaudae* and their brutal leader, Anyon. The *Bagaudae*, claiming the same goal of a free and liberal Gaul as their ancient namesake, had threatened to execute Brun on a live broadcast if the Gallic *Augustus* refused to grant sovereignty to Aquitaine under the official leadership of Anyon. They were on the verge of success, but a timely and brutal raid by Britannian *praetorian* troopers resulted in Brun's safe return to his work and uncovered a political mess behind the freedom fighters. 
 
 Before being killed, Anyon had revealed that his movement was backed by a joint venture between the Hispanian Empire and a still unknown president of the Sardinian Merchant Company, based in Olbia. The outing of the illegal proxy war had resulted in a unanimous decision by the *Consilium Imperatorum*: extensive embargoes on the Hispanian Empire, ejection of the Augustus, Maximus Bos Taurus, from the Council, and a combined effort to dismantle the now isolated Empire. 
 
 However, the *Insulari Occidentalis Incorporatus* had proven more difficult to officially sanction. While their headquarters was occupied by the IOI Guard and the company's products were confiscated at ports, removed from stalls and stores across the Empires, and destroyed or repurposed, new products were continuously found. An entire black market dedicated to the legally defunct company arose, freelance ships carrying the goods to almost any port while border-runners flitted the goods across international boundaries to avoid garrisons and officials. If a runner or ship captain was captured they would either kill themselves before revealing anything useful, immediately give up all the information they had ( which rarely resulted in further arrests, as the locations were always abandoned ), or insisting that they were only hired to run the goods and knew nothing else. It was maddening for the authorities. 
 
 However, that was before Aldun Brun's slip-space travel had become viable on a mass scale. Having proven that vast swaths of space could be travelled in feasible chunks of time, Brun was able to secure funding from almost every Empire on Terra. With the military and commercial cooperation of the Empires already established to combat the withering Hispanian Empire and Sardinian Merchant Company outlaws, in two years Brun's invention had achieved something that had been sought since the first year of the *Consilium Imperatorum*: the *Lex Foederatio Mundi*, nominally binding the Empires into a joint governing body. Though far from a united Roman Empire, once more focused in the Eternal City, the agreement had resulted in something likened to the Greek city-states of old cooperating for the good of Greece. Each of the 40 Empires, excluding Hispania, as well as the Zikkan-Persian Empire, began to work together to further advance their power into the unknown of space. The *Consilium Imperatorum* declared April 21st, 1853 ab imperatora pax the beginning of a new era: April 21st, symbolically important as the founding of Rome, was solidified as year zero after the ascent. The agreement had it that the games celebrating the founding of Rome would be punctuated by the first interstellar vessel, *The Heart of Rome*, being launched from a few miles north-west of the Eternal City. And in trailing it its wake were the hordes of settlers, soldiers, and the expected but despised wave of smugglers and pirates. 
 
 Rufinus felt his communicator vibrate against the inside of his wrist, a yellow envelope blinked around the black number 32 at the top right of its 1 inch screen. He swiped his finger across the screen, the touch activation immediately bringing up his unread personal messages. They were categorized by contact: 8 from his wife, Vorena, all titled with some variant of `` We **need** Pandora's Box!'' 15 from his oldest daughter, Vulpina, with titles either begging for Pandora's Box or accusing him of not loving her, and 9 from his youngest, Vorena Minor, echoing her sister's wishes. Atop their annoying pleas and insults was the message which had caused the vibration, time-stamped 0019sc, from his chief secretary. The dim glow of his communicator screen switch from the white to blue as he opened the message. 
 
 SUBJECT: LOCKING DOWN PANDORA'S BOX 
 
 Good News, Prefect Gaius Vulpinus! We've had a breakthrough with the local smuggling ring. A meeting has been setup regarding a confiscated shipment of the black-market handbags that have all our wives and daughters in a ruckus. 
 
 Our woes are at an end! 
 
 Marcus Lectius 
 
 Rufinus smiled at the thought of finally having a means to silence his wife and daughters. 
 
 `` If only for a little while,'' he sighed as he clicked the power button on his monitor, rolled his chair away from his desk, and stood with a stretch.
"," Recast the essay with the optimism and specific cultural references of 1950s American suburbia, including the era's unique slang.","As the clock glowed 0018sc, Gaius Vulpinus Rufinus, a proud Colonio Praefectus, was hunched over his mechanical keyboard, penning yet another denial letter to the south-western hemisphere. The dream of increasing their vigiles budget had been dashed once too many times. A frustrated sigh escaped his lips as he leaned back in his hydraulic chair, the hiss of his distress echoing through the office.

The weight of his position and the sheer volume of daily issues he faced as Colonio Praefectus were overwhelming. The vast expanse of the Britannian Empire, with its numerous provinces and unruly subjects, presented an endless array of challenges. But none were more significant than the recent addition of South Africa to the empire. This pivotal province, strategically positioned between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, had become a focal point for trade and a center of cultural and recreational activity in the southern hemisphere.

Forty years earlier, a tragic tale unfolded. Aldus Brun, a brilliant German scientist, had been kidnapped by the Bagaudae, a group of freedom fighters driven by the dream of a free Gaul. Their leader, Anyon, a ruthless figure, had threatened to execute Brun on a live broadcast if the Gallic Augustus refused to grant sovereignty to Aquitaine under his leadership. It was a close call, but timely intervention by the Britannian praetorian troops saved Brun from his impending doom.

The events of that fateful day had been overshadowed by the revelation that Anyon's movement had been backed by a joint venture of powerful individuals, men driven by greed and ambition rather than noble ideals. The tragedy served as a stark reminder of the complexities and dangers of human nature, even in the midst of a glorious era of progress and prosperity."
"My eyes hurt and it feels strange. Now I remember I have gone through this pull out phase hundreds of times already and I remember that I have never gotten used to it. Memories were flooding in and it is hard to distinguish simulation and reality. `` You better have a good reason to call time out Nikola.... That's 40 years of hard work down the drain.'' 
 
 `` Your Sarkowsky got 20 rank D artefacts and 1 rank C. Others are n't doing much better. You guys were doing well but we have to regroup to make the cut.'' 
 `` Do n't tell me you pulled the whole team out...'' 
 `` Only 8 of you. Stacy and Magnus are staying.'' 
 
 I crawled up to take a look around. No one else has yet to wake. Logout delay differs for each player. It can be as short as 30 minutes and as long as 4 hours. I am always first to wake. I do n't like it, 4 hours is like 2 weeks in in-game time and you can do so much in two weeks when you begin to figure out that reality is not as real as you thought. 
 
 `` You better have some good saves ready because we only got... what? 45 years left?'' 
 
 Now that I have recollected myself a little better I know Nikola is probably right. If Sarkowsky was considered doing well then we were n't going to make the cut and we would need a new strategy. We saved 10 respawns for a time like this and we might as well take advantage of it. Civilization has moved so much in the past decades that having an updated tactic might actually be worth it. Regroups are useful because our personalities get influenced by our in-game bodies and background very much. It is hard to know for sure that someone is a player in game, let alone a teammate. 
 
 I used the time to read through the briefing notes that Nikola prepared for us. Apparently about 40 in-game years ago some teams figured out that a rank B artefact is hidden somewhere under the deep ocean floor and another one is on Mars. I guess that is the actual reason behind the oil vs. clean energy controversy and that is why nobody seemed to care about global warming. By now 20 % of the rank C artefacts are in museums, 40 % are in private possession and the rest are in the black market. That is no surprise. Rank Cs have always been the battle field. The meta strategy has always been to get political influence in the early game, implement capitalism, and then to amass rank C artefacts. In every game that I played, players of teams cooperated for this strategy. It seems to be the most efficient and consistent way to beat the NPCs. 
 
 `` Elon Musk is kicking ass. He is a player right? Which team is he on?'' Keyman apparently woke, so did most others 
 `` Stacy is doing pretty well is n't she?'' Nikola could n't hide his smile 
 `` We would only have a tier 2 starting positions in game # 3 with the amount of artefact points that we had... But if we...'' Nikola went on. 
 `` Stacy will get to Mars and no one will drill in the ocean again. Huddle up, this is how we do it.''
