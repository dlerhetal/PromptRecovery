RABINOWITZ, Justice.
I. INTRODUCTION
This appeal centers on the application of the notice requirement of the Differing Site Conditions clause found in a contract between appellant Neal & Company, Inc. (NCI) and appellee City of Dillingham (City). Ap-pellee CH2M Hill (Hill), the City's engineer on the project, is involved in this appeal primarily because it acted as the City's representative on the project.
NCI claims that it encountered difficulties in excavation during the project because of unexpected soil conditions, that it gave notice of these unexpected conditions to Hill (and thus constructively to the City), and that therefore it is entitled to assert a claim under the Differing Site Conditions clause. The City and Hill claim that no notice of a differing site condition was given. The superior court ruled on partial summary judgment that NCI did not give adequate notice of a differing site condition.
NCI also appeals the superior court's denial of its motions for leave to amend its complaint, for continuance of the trial, and for disqualification of thé trial judge.
II. FACTS
In February 1987 the City solicited bids for the construction of a sewerage facility. The project included two lagoon ponds. The lagoons were to be dug into a bluff outside of Dillingham. Interested bidders received a set of drawings and a volume containing bidding requirements, contract forms, conditions of the contract, and construction specifications, along with a ""Geotechnical Data Summary."" The geological survey and the data summary, as well as all technical specifications for the project, were completed by Hill, the City's engineer and on-site representative for the project."
"The data summary stated that there was a layer of peat containing some silt infilling extending four feet to eight feet below the original ground surface. Below the peat was a layer of sand and silty sand interbedded with layers of silt extending about six to twelve feet below the peat zone. Below that, the data summary described the remaining depth of the excavation as ""fairly uniform to the remaining depth of the borings, showing a layer of stiff-to-hard clay having low-to-medium plasticity."" Regarding the clay layer, the data summary specified: ""Occasional samples contained clay with gravel and sand suspended in the clay matrix, indicating that the clay unit may be a glacial till. No distinct bedding or layers of coarse grained material were found in the clay unit."" The data summary went on to describe the process by which the lagoons could be constructed:
The most attractive aspect of constructing the lagoons in the lower clay zone of the bluff is that they will not have to be lined. Also, native materials will not have to be recompacted to form the dikes, as the dikes can be constructed by carving the lagoons out of the bluff and leaving the clay intact around them. Construction concerns for this configuration are primarily slope protection against seepage and removal and disposal of the excavated material.
A set of contract documents was sent to NCI. On April 1,1987, bids were opened and NCI was declared the low bidder at $2,059,-991. NCI began the excavation on June 6, 1987. Excavation of the first dig, down to the forty-seven foot elevation of the pond surface, was completed. Work was suspended in October 1987. The second dig, excavation of the pond prisms, began when the ground froze. Excavation was completed by April 20,1988."
"NCI contends that Green's visit was scheduled after and because of the Mattoon-Riehie conversation regarding the sand lenses. The City and Hill contend that Green's visit had already been scheduled.
During Green's visit, a test pit was dug in each of the pond prisms, and a soil sample was taken from one of the pits. Green's field notes, taken at the time the pits were dug, indicate that at the level where the lagoons were to be dug, he saw ""clayey silt Slightly plastic Blue Gray Moist slightly Blocky structure, stiff to n. stiff[.]"" This level (two to nineteen feet down from the forty-seven foot elevation of the surface of the lagoon) had been described in the Data Summary as ""a layer of stiff-to-hard clay having low-to-medium plasticity.""
During this time, the consistency of the soil was causing difficulties in NCI's excavation. The soil in the lagoon area turned into a sticky mud, creating problems with excavation and transportation. The consistency of the soil, and the difficulty of excavating it, form the basis of NCI's Differing Site Condition claim.
During the 1988 phase of the excavation, water infiltration continued to cause problems. In October 1988, NCI advised Hill that it was considering legal action. NCI then filed suit.
III. SUPERIOR COURT PROCEEDINGS
. During the course of these proceedings, numerous claims and cross-claims were filed. The following are relevant to this appeal.
On March 29, 1990, NCI filed a second amended complaint, which added NCI's Differing Site Condition claim to the lawsuit as the sixth cause of action, and added what NCI interprets as a defective specifications claim as the seventh cause of action. In May, NCI filed a substitute second amended complaint. Judge Beverly Cutler granted the motion to amend on August 6, 1990. In January 1991, the City, seeking indemnity from NCI's claims, filed a third-party complaint against Hill."
"In April 1993, NCI moved for partial summary judgment, seeking to establish the sufficiency of its notice of differing site conditions. The City moved for summary judgment against both NCI and Hill. In October 1993 the superior court granted partial summary judgment to the City and dismissed NCI's sixth and seventh causes of action. The court subsequently denied NCI's motion for reconsideration.
Meanwhile, in November 1993, NCI filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint and a motion to continue the trial. The superior court denied these motions. The superior court also denied NCI's motion to reconsider the denial of its motion to amend.
On January 26,1994, NCI filed a motion to disqualify the judge. The next day, Judge Cutler refused to recuse herself, and referred the motion to the presiding judge for assignment. The motion was assigned to Judge Peter A. Michalski, who denied the motion for disqualification on January 31.
On February 3, 1994, the parties reached a settlement, reserving to NCI the right to appeal the rulings which are now before us: the dismissal of NCI's sixth and seventh causes of action, the denial of NCI's motions for leave to file a third amended complaint and for continuance of the trial, and the denial of the motion to disqualify Judge Cutler.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. The Summary Judgment Dismissing NCI's Sixth and Seventh Causes of Action
Resolution of this summary judgment turns on the interpretation and application of the Differing Site Conditions clause which, at the time the contract for this project was made, was required by the Environmental Protection Agency in contracts for projects with EPA funding. 40 C.F.R. § 33.1030 (1986). NCI filed a motion seeking to establish that oral communications with Hill constituted actual notice sufficient to meet the notice requirements in the Differing Site Condition contract clause. Paragraph 4(a) of the contract requires that the notice be in writing. Though there is no claim that NCI provided timely written notice of any differing site condition, case law establishes that under certain circumstances timely actual notice, even in the absence of written notice, will be considered sufficient notice under the clause. See, e.g., Brechan Enter. v. United States, 12 Cl.Ct. 545 (1987) (""[N]otice does not need to be in any specific format; it need only show the existence of the condition."")."
"In Brinderson Corp. v. Hampton Rds. San. Dist., 825 F.2d 41 (4th Cir.1987), a contractor had problems with wet soil conditions which forced it to incur increased costs. The court stated that ""[generally, when the owner has actual or constructive notice of the conditions underlying the claim and an opportunity to investigate, that is sufficient."" Id. at 44. Similarly, NCI's notice to the City, though not in writing, will be considered sufficient if it was clear and it alerted or should have alerted the City to the fact that NCI believed it had encountered differing site conditions.
NCI claims that Green, and therefore Hill, was put on notice when Green met with NCI representatives to talk about problems with the composition of the soil and then actually took a soil sample and noted that its composition differed from what the data summary predicted. If Green knew upon looking at the soil that the site condition was materially different from what was expected, he was on notice even if the contractor continued to labor ignorantly, having no idea why work was progressing so slowly.
NCI's position is that after concerns about sand lenses were expressed to Richie, Green was specially brought in to test the soil. When he looked at the pits he saw ""clayey silt, "" not clay, at the elevation of the lagoon prisms (ie., between elevations forty-seven and twenty-nine). NCI asserts that the clayey silt constituted a differing site condition, and that Green knew that it was.
But NCI's assertions and suppositions are not supported by reasonable inferences from the evidence. When Green came to inspect the soil — even if he came in especially because of NCI's concerns — the reason for his visit was possible sand lenses in the floor of the lagoon, not the consistency of the material to be excavated. The notes he took were simply a recording of what he saw at various levels, not the focus of his investigation."
"NCI asserts that Mattoon's characterization of the material within the lagoon prism as blue clay, and the level the sample was taken, are both evidence that Green knew about the differing site condition and attempted to mislead NCI into believing there was none.
NCI speculates that Green, knowing that the presence of clayey silt was a differing site condition, lied to Mattoon to cover up the problem, telling him that they were looking at blue clay. But there is no evidence in the record that Green told Mattoon that the soil was blue clay, except for Mattoon's note indicating that they had found blue clay. Mat-toon's note nowhere states that he received this classification from Green.
NCI also suggests that Green ""used his superior knowledge to select a single sample that aided in the deception."" Because the sample was taken from test pit 1, and not pit 2, and because it was taken from below the lagoon floor, NCI concludes that Green was taking the sample from a place he knew would be clay. But NCI's June-July 1987 concern regarding the soil composition, which Mattoon had expressed to Richie, was the integrity of the pond floors, not the difficulty of excavation. None of NCI's representatives found it remarkable at the time that Green took a sample from below the bottom of the lagoon. The only reasonable conclusion is that, since seepage in the lagoon floor was the concern, Green took a sample from the material which would eventually form the floor of the lagoon in order to test its characteristics."
"B. Denial of NCI's Motions to Amend Complaint and for Continuance of Trial
In November of 1993, NCI sought to amend its complaint. It reworded its seventh cause of action to indicate that it was intended to state a defective specifications claim rather than simply repeat the sixth cause of action's claim of differing site conditions. Also, NCI attempted for the first time to assert four separate claims directly against Hill. To this point, NCI had made all of its claims against the City, which then sought indemnity from Hill; there had been no direct NCI claims against Hill. Finally, NCI sought a continuance. The superior court denied all of these motions.
NCI argues that the superior court's denial of leave to amend was based on a failure to apply Civil Rule 15(a), which provides that ""leave shall be freely given when justice so requires."" The superior court stated that it
finds no manifest injustice in denying Neal leave to amend its complaint at this late date. Therefore the court finds that justice does not require amendment. Neal has had ample opportunity to pursue in a timely fashion all of the claims listed in the proposed Third Amended Complaint.... [Tjhere is no manifest injustice in failing to permit amendment on the eve of trial, after five years of preparation and motions.
NCI claims that the superior court's application of the ""manifest injustice"" standard was an error.
The superior court indicated in its order denying Neal's motion to amend his complaint that its reason for applying the ""manifest injustice"" standard was Civil Rule 16(e). While Civil Rule 15(a) directs that leave be ""freely granted"" by the court ""when justice so requires,"" Civil Rule 16(e) states that pretrial orders following a final pretrial conference shall control unless modified by the judge ""to prevent manifest injustice."""
"The superior court carefully and accurately analyzed the amendments which NCI was offering to its complaint. All of its findings would sustain a denial of leave to amend under either the Rule 15(a) or the Rule 16(e) standard.
Similarly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the superior court, at that late point in the litigation, to deny a continuance to NCI.
C. Denial of NCI's Motion for Disqualification
During a conference involving Tony Neal, President of NCI, NCI's counsel, and Hicks and Moeller, counsel for the City, Hicks told Neal about some contact he had with Judge Cutler. Judge Cutler had worked for Hicks approximately twenty years earlier, and they had occasional social contact since. There are some minor disputes as to some details.
However, there is no record support for NCI's assertion of bias or lack of impartiality. In short, there is no merit in NCI's claim that Judge Cutler should have been disqualified.
Judge Cutler and Judge Michalski did not err in denying the motion to disqualify.
V. CONCLUSION
Review of the record shows that the superior court correctly granted summary judgment against NCI on its Differing Site Conditions claim. NCI's other points on appeal, regarding the motions to amend, to continue the trial, and to recuse the trial judge, are also without merit. The rulings of the superior court and of Judge Michalski are AFFIRMED in all respects.
MOORE, C.J., not participating.
. In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we ""must determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Saddler v. Alaska Marine Lines, 856 P.2d 784, 787 (Alaska 1993). All reasonable factual inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. Wright v. State, 824 P.2d 718, 720 (Alaska 1992). When reviewing a trial court's interpretation of contract language, based solely on documentary evidence, this court will use its independent judgment. Klosterman v. Hickel Inv. Co., 821 P.2d 118, 122 (Alaska 1991)."
". ""A DSC exists if the actual conditions of the site differ materially from what . a contractor would have expected based on indications in the contract."" Municipality of Anchorage v. Frank Coluccio Constr. Co., 826 P.2d 316, 323 (Alaska 1992).
.The superior court entered the following relevant findings of fact regarding the differing site condition issue:
Here the court finds that, under the case law cited by Neal & Co., in order for oral notice to be sufficient to replace the written notice specifically called for in the contract, either the oral notice must have given actual notice of differing site conditions to CH2M Hill and/or the City, or the oral notice must be oral notice that would have given notice of differing site conditions to CH2M Hill and/or the City except for conditions beyond Neal & Co.'s control. The court notes that in this case there is a genuine dispute regarding to whom notice of a differing site condition must be given. Given the court's holding discussed below that Neal & Co. did not give adequate notice to CH2M Hill, the court does not reach this latter issue.
The court finds that Neal & Co. failed to give oral notice of differing soil conditions in the lagoon excavation, sufficiently forceful to anyone to replace the contractual requirement of clear written notice. This holding is based on the fact that Neal & Co. merely suggested, once, that there might be a differing soil condition, and when this suggestion was rejected by CH2M Hill, Neal & Co. dropped the subject. There was no appeal to higher authority of this rejection by Neal & Co., or specific or repeated oral notice given, as occurred in W.C. Shepherd [v. United States, 125 Ct.Cl. 724, 113 F.Supp. 648 (1953)] and Brinderson."
"The court finds that, at best, Neal & Co. gave a tentative and equivocal notice that there may have been a differing site condition at the lagoon site, and holds that this notice was not sufficient to replace the written notice requirement of E.P.A. Contract Clause 4(a), or to support a claim for equitable adjustment of the contract price under 4(c). See, Blankenship Const[r], Co. v. N.C. State Highway Comm'n, 28 N.C.App. 593, 222 S.E.2d 452, 461 (1976).
Based on the discussion above, the court finds that there is no material fact dispute regarding Neal & Co.'s purported notice to CH2M Hill, and based on the facts noted, the court holds as a matter of law that the City is entitled to summary judgment that Neal & Co.'s differing site condition claim is barred for lack of adequate notice as required by E.P.A. Contract Clause 4(c) and Contract General Condition 58. Neal & Co.'s differing site condition claim against the City of Dillingham is hereby dismissed from this case.
In denying NCI's motion for reconsideration, the superior court stated in part:
If Neal in fact encountered a differing site condition for which contract adjustment and written notice were required, Neal as the contractor on a large public works project, engaged in the actual earthwork that was the primary focus of the project and doing the actual encountering of differing conditions, if such were truly encountered, had the responsibility to give written notice or other compelling notice.
. The superior court read NCI's seventh cause of action as a restatement of the sixth cause of action, which was explicitly a Differing Site Condition claim. NCI maintains that the seventh cause of action was a defective specifications claim, not a Differing Site Condition claim. It is unnecessary to determine whether NCI is correct in this assertion, as a defective specifications claim under the circumstances of the case at bar would fall to the same deficiency of notice which defeats the Differing Site Condition claim."
"OPINION
COATS, Judge.
Major Townsel was convicted, following a jury trial, of four counts of robbery in the first degree, AS 11.41.500(a)(1), and one count of misconduct involving weapons in the first degree, AS 11.61.200(a)(3). Judge Rene Gonzalez sentenced Townsel to the presumptive seven-year term for each count of robbery. He imposed three of the robbery sentences concurrently but imposed the fourth sentence consecutively. Judge Gonzalez sentenced Townsel to a five-year concurrent term for misconduct involving weapons. Thus, Townsel's composite sentence is fourteen years. Townsel appeals his conviction and sentence.
Townsel first argues that Judge Gonzalez erred in failing to grant his suppression motion. He argues that the evidence against him was obtained as the result of a traffic stop which was used as a pretext for a search. In deciding this issue, Judge Gonzalez issued a written decision which set out the facts of the case as he found them."
"On January 5, 1986 at approximately 11:58 p.m. an individual robbed the Oaken Keg at 900 East Dimond Boulevard in Anchorage. Anchorage Police Officer Mizelle responded at approximately 11:59 p.m. and made contact with the alleged victim Glenda Morrison. Ms. Morrison informed the officer that a juvenile black male between the ages of 16-20, approximately 5'6""-5'-7"" and 130-140 pounds with black hair and brown eyes had just robbed the Oaken Keg. The individual was described as wearing a brown and white bandanna and a floppy or ski type hat. The individual had left on foot travelling east bound from the Oaken Keg and Carrs complex.
After the robbery Ms. Morrison had contacted her supervisor by intercom. The supervisor apparently contacted Ms. Morrison in person and notified the police. A police dispatcher relayed the information obtained from the Oaken Keg personnel over the radio to on duty officers.
At approximately 11:58 p.m. Officer David Rochford was on duty at the intersection of 36th and ""A"" when he was advised by dispatch that an armed robbery had taken place at the Oaken Keg at Old Seward and Dimond. Dispatch indicated that the suspect was a juvenile black male, armed with a rifle, and had fled on foot.
Officer Rochford proceeded to the intersection of New Seward and 36th Avenue and arrived at said intersection approximately two minutes later. Upon his arrival he observed a vehicle traveling north bound at the speed limit. The following vehicle infractions were observed by Officer Rochford: vehicle had its left headlight out, the driver's window was obstructed by clouded visqueen, a taillight lens was broken allowing white light to shine through, and the license plate was obscured."
"When Officer Rochford was behind subject vehicle, he determined that the vehicle was exceeding the speed limit by ten miles per hour — by travelling at approximately 55 miles per hour in a 45 mile per hour zone.
Officer Rochford testified that he would have stopped the vehicle for the traffic and vehicular infractions in the normal course of his duties. Consequently the officer stopped the vehicle. At the driver's window, the officer asked the driver to exit the vehicle. The driver explained that because the driver's door did not open, he had to exit from the passenger side. As the driver slid across the seat and exited from the car, the officer asked him for his driver's license. As the driver spoke the officer saw the muzzle of a rifle in the back seat of the car. When the officer told the driver not to touch the rifle the defendant reached for the gun. The officer drew his weapon and the defendant threw the rifle to the ground and fled on foot. The officer was unable to catch the defendant. Another officer arrived on the scene and seized a license, a wallet, a bag and a rifle from the vehicle. A search warrant was issued to search defendant's residence and to further search the vehicle based upon the evidence seized. Relying upon the evidence found in the vehicle and at the defendant's residence, the defendant was charged in the indictment with four courts of robbery in the first degree, one count of burglary in the second degree, and one count of misconduct involving weapons in the first degree."
"Officer Rochford had substantial evidence to stop defendant's vehicle for violations of traffic regulations and the evidence presented does not support the assertion that this was merely a pretext stop.
Townsel cites Brown v. State, 580 P.2d 1174 (Alaska 1978) as the leading Alaska case in support of his position. Brown does establish that ""an arrest (or a traffic stop) should not be used as a pretext for a search."" Id. at 1176 (footnote omitted). However, the case also establishes that where ""there is substantial evidence to support the trial court's determination that [the defendant's] vehicle was stopped for a violation of traffic regulations and that [the stop] was not a pretext stop,"" then the stop was not illegal. Id. at 1176 (footnote omitted). Officer Rochford testified that he stopped the vehicle for the traffic and vehicular infractions, not on a pretext to enable him to investigate the robbery. He testified that he would have made this stop under normal conditions if he was not investigating the robbery. Judge Gonzalez found the officer's testimony to be credible and this conclusion is not clearly erroneous. We conclude that Brown is controlling, and we affirm the trial court's decision.
Townsel next argues that his sentence was excessive. Townsel was thirty-five at the time of these offenses and had no prior felony convictions. In 1981, he served seventeen days in jail for misconduct involving weapons; in the presentence report Town-sel indicated he had discharged a firearm in the city limits. In 1976, he was fined $500 dollars for possession of marijuana. He has had several non-serious traffic violations. Townsel served two years in the military and received an honorable discharge."
"Robbery in the first degree is a class A felony. The maximum sentence is twenty years. The presumptive sentence for a first felony offender who possesses a firearm during the offense is seven years. A second felony offender faces a ten-year presumptive term, a third felony offender fifteen years. In Austin v. State, 627 P.2d 657, 657-58 (Alaska App.1981), we stated the general rule that ""[njormally a first offender should receive a more favorable sentence than the presumptive sentence for a second offender. It is clear this rule should be violated only in an exceptional case."" Thus, Judge Gonzalez could sentence Townsel to a sentence of ten years or greater only if he found the case to be exceptional.
Furthermore, the A.B.A. Standards governing sentencing alternatives and procedures provide that ""[f]or most offenses, the maximum prison term authorized ought not to exceed ten years and normally should not exceed five years. Longer sentences should be reserved for particularly serious offenses committed by particularly dangerous offenders."" Ill Standards for Criminal Justice, § 18-2.1 (2nd ed. Supp.1982). We have defined who is a particularly dangerous offender by referring to the A.B.A. Standard governing habitual offenders. Id. at § 18-4.4. That standard defines an habitual offender as one who has been convicted of at least two prior felonies, which were committed on two different occasions, within five years of the present offense. Under the standards, the habitual offender must have previously served a sentence in excess of one year. Under the A.B.A. Standards, therefore, Townsel does not qualify as either a habitual offender or a particularly dangerous offender. Because Townsel has never been previously convicted of a felony nor served an extensive period of confinement, we do not believe that there is a reliable basis for concluding that he is incapable of rehabilitation or that his isolation from society for a period in excess of ten years is necessary."
"OPINION
BRYNER, Chief Judge.
George A. Konrad was convicted, following a jury trial, of assault in the third degree, assault in the second degree, and terroristic threatening. Konrad appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss his indictment, that Alaska's ter-roristic threatening statute is unconstitutionally vague, that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction, that the trial court erred in excluding testimony offered to impeach the victim, and that the court erred in denying his motion for a new trial when a new judge was assigned to his case for purposes of conducting sentencing proceedings. We affirm Konrad's convictions for second-degree assault and terroristic threatening, but vacate his conviction for third-degree, assault."
"Konrad was indicted for a series of incidents that occurred during the breakup of his marriage to Luann Konrad. The indictment charged Konrad with third-degree assault for recklessly causing physical injury to Luann Konrad by striking her on the head and ribs with his hands, with second-degree assault for recklessly causing serious physical injury to Luann by throwing her off a bed onto a wooden crate, and with terroristic threatening for engaging Luann in a telephone conversation in which Konrad repeatedly threatened to kill her.
ASSAULT IN THE THIRD DEGREE
On May 9, 1986, following a heated argument, George Konrad struck Luann Konrad twice with his hands: once on the head and once on the ribs. Luann Konrad experienced abdominal pain following the assault. Several days later a physician determined that the blow to Luann's midsection had injured her spleen, causing it to bleed into her abdominal cavity. The injury resolved itself without treatment.
Based on the May 9 incident, the state requested the grand jury to charge Konrad with assault in the third degree. The state proceeded under AS 11.41.220(a)(2), which states that ""a person commits the crime of assault in the third degree if that person recklessly . causes physical injury to another person by means of a dangerous instrument."" The state's theory was that Konrad's hands were dangerous instruments.
After reading the statutory definition of ""dangerous instrument"" to the grand jury, the prosecutor stated, in relevant part: ""I would instruct you at this time that in the state of Alaska hands or feet can be considered a dangerous instrument under the definition that I have given you of a dangerous instrument."" The grand jury returned a true bill."
"The term ""dangerous instrument"" is defined in AS 11.81.900(b)(ll):
(11) ""fDJangerous instrument"" means any deadly weapon or anything which, under the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used, or threatened to be used, is capable of causing death or serious physical injury.
""Physical injury"" and ""serious physical injury"" are in turn defined in AS 11.81.-900(b)(40) and (50):
(40) ""[Pjhysical injury"" means a physical pain or an impairment of physical condition;
(50) ""[S]erious physical injury"" means
(A) physical injury caused by an act performed under circumstances that create a substantial risk of death; or
(B) physical injury that causes serious and protracted disfigurement, protracted impairment of health, protracted loss or impairment of the function of a body member or organ, or that unlawfully terminates a pregnancy.
This court has never squarely decided whether a bare hand can be a ""dangerous instrument"" within the meaning of these provisions. In Wettanen v. State, 656 P.2d 1213 (Alaska App.1983), we held that a bare foot could qualify as a dangerous instrument under certain circumstances. The evidence there established that Wetta-nen had kicked another person repeatedly about the face and head, inflicting serious physical injuries. Because the state neglected to establish whether Wettanen was shod when he committed the assault, it was necessary to decide if a bare foot could qualify as a dangerous instrument. We concluded that sufficient evidence had been presented at trial to allow a finding that Wettanen's foot was a dangerous instrument, even if it was unshod. Id. at 1218. In reaching, this conclusion, we expressly declined to decide whether a bare hand could similarly qualify as a dangerous instrument, noting that the cases from other jurisdictions on the issue are in conflict. Id. at 1218."
"For the purpose of deciding the present case, we may likewise assume that there is no categorical prohibition against a hand being deemed a dangerous instrument under the definition set forth in AS 11.81.900(b)(ll). Our prior cases nevertheless firmly establish that the question of whether a hand qualifies as a dangerous instrument in any given case must be answered by examining the precise manner in which the hand is actually used.
The need to focus on the specific circumstances of each case derives from the definition of ""dangerous instrument."" While the statutory definition encompasses ""anything"" that is capable of causing death or serious physical injury, the express language of the statute requires that an instrument's potential for causing death or serious physical injury be assessed in light of ""the circumstances in which it is used, attempted to be used, or threatened to be used."" AS 11.81.900(b)(ll). It is the actual use of the instrument in each case that must be considered, not abstract possibilities for use of the instrument in hypothetical cases.
We emphasized this point in Wettanen, cautioning that ""every . blow, even if it causes serious injury, will not automatically be an assault with a dangerous instrument."" Wettanen, 656 P.2d at 1217. We pointed out that the inquiry must focus on the vulnerability of the victim and the specific nature of the assault in each case. Id. at 1217. In this regard, we emphasized that ""the requirement of a dangerous instrument serves to shift the focus of the trier of facts' attention from the result (physical injuries), which in any given case may have been unforeseeable to the defendant at the time the assault was committed, to the manner in which the assault was committed."" Id. at 1218."
"We found that the evidence in Carson did not support a finding that deadly force had been used. In reaching this conclu sion, we emphasized the need to focus on the actual risk of serious physical injury posed in the specific case, rather than on the abstract possibility of serious physical injury under other, hypothetical circumstances. We said, in relevant part:
Although we can certainly conceive of cases in which specific testimony describing a kick to the groin or an attack by a dog would support the inference that a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury was created, we are unwilling to conclude that testimony establishing no more than the unadorned fact of a kick to the groin or an attack by a police dog is per se sufficient to create a jury question as to the use of deadly force. The issue is not one to be resolved in the abstract. There must, at a minimum, be some particularized evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that a substantial risk of serious physical injury was actually created in the specific case at bar.
The issue is analogous to one we considered in Wettanen v. State. There, we held that, while any object, including an unshod foot, that was capable of inflicting serious physical injury might qualify under the broad statutory definition of ""dangerous instrument,"" the actual determination of whether a dangerous instrument was used must be made on a case-by-case basis, based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the actual use of the object in question."
"When read together, Wettanen and Carson stand for the proposition that, before a hand may be deemed a ""dangerous instrument,"" the state must present particularized evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the manner in which the hand was used in the case at issue posed an actual and substantial risk of causing death or serious physical injury, rather than a risk that was merely hypothetical or abstract.
Obviously, whenever serious physical injury does in fact occur, there will be prima facie evidence to support a finding that a dangerous instrument was used. Conversely, when serious physical injury does not occur, other case-specific evidence must be adduced to establish that the risk of such injury was both actual and substantial, even though it did not in fact occur.
The facts of the present case are problematic when viewed in light of this analysis. We consider initially the grand jury proceedings. The state did not contend below, and it does not argue on appeal, that Luann Konrad suffered serious physical injury when Konrad struck her with his hands. In presenting its case to the grand jury, the prosecution instructed that ""under Alaska law hands or feet can be considered dangerous instruments.""
The ambiguity of this instruction is troublesome. While it might be taken to indicate that the decision as to whether Konrad's hands were dangerous instruments was a factual one to be made by the grand jury, it might as readily be taken to indicate that there was no need at all for the grand jury to consider the issue, since it was settled as a matter of Alaska law. In our view, the giving of this instruction raises a serious question as to whether the grand jury in Konrad's case ever actually determined, as a factual matter, whether Konrad used his hands in a manner capable of inflicting death or serious physical injury-"
"We recognize that the grand jury was appropriately instructed on the statutory definitions of ""dangerous instrument,"" ""physical injury,"" and ""serious physical injury."" Nevertheless, when, as in the present case, the defendant is alleged to have used a dangerous instrument that was not a ""deadly weapon"" and that did not actually inflict death or serious physical injury, the possibility that the grand jury might decide the instrument's potential for causing injury as an abstract or hypothetical matter is, in our view, sufficiently great to require that an express instruction be given. The instruction should alert the grand jury to the need for it to find, based on the evidence in the case before it, that the defendant used an instrument in a manner that actually created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury. In view of the lack of an appropriate clarifying instruction and the ambiguity of the instruction actually given, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying Konrad's pretrial motion to dismiss the count charging him with assault in the third degree.
We must separately consider whether sufficient evidence was presented at trial to support Konrad's conviction of assault in the third degree. As we have already indicated, the state does not allege that the evidence established that Konrad inflicted serious physical injury by striking Luann Konrad with his hands. While Luann suffered internal bleeding from the spleen, the condition healed without treatment within a short period of time. No medical evidence was adduced to establish that Luann's condition verged on becoming more serious or that a blow to the ribs similar to that inflicted by Konrad actually posed a risk of inflicting more severe injuries to the spleen or to other internal organs. See, e.g., James v. State, 671 P.2d 885, 888-89 (Alaska App.1983), rev'd on other grounds, State v. James, 698 P.2d 1161 (Alaska 1985)."
"Other than the fact that Konrad had awakened Luann Konrad shortly before he assaulted her, there was no evidence to suggest that she was especially susceptible to incurring a serious physical injury. Although it can be inferred that Luann would have been better able to ward off Konrad's blows and to prevent the injuries that she did receive had she not recently been asleep, nothing in the evidence establishes that she was vulnerable to suffering injury more serious than that actually inflicted merely because she had been sleeping and was caught off guard by Konrad's assault.
In arguing that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that Konrad's hands were dangerous instruments, the state notes that, after the assault, Konrad offered to take Luann to the doctor when he got back from work. The state contends that this evidence reflects upon the seriousness of Konrad's assault and could legitimately be relied on by the jury.
To the extent that Konrad's offer of assistance betrayed his awareness that he had assaulted Luann Konrad with sufficient force to inflict injuries requiring medical treatment, the state is correct. However, the evidence does nothing to indicate that Konrad believed he had inflicted serious physical injury, as opposed to nonserious physical injury. Consequently, the evidence fails to establish, either directly or inferentially, that his assault created an actual and substantial risk of serious physical injury.
In ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence at trial, we must view the evidence and the inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether reasonable jurors could conclude that the defendant's guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt. Snyder v. State, 661 P.2d 638, 641 (Alaska App.1983); Des Jardins v. State, 551 P.2d 181, 184 (Alaska 1976). Applying this standard to the present case, we conclude that insufficient evidence was adduced to support Konrad's conviction of third-degree assault. In our view, the evidence cannot justify a finding that Konrad's hands qualified as dangerous instruments. On the record of the present case, a conclusion that Konrad's hands were capable of causing death or serious physical injury under the circumstances in which they were actually used— that is, that they actually created a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to Luann Konrad — would be wholly speculative."
"ASSAULT IN THE SECOND DEGREE
On August 24, 1986, Konrad became angry with Luann Konrad and threw her off of their bed. She struck the corner of a wooden crate that was on the floor; as a result of the blow Luann suffered a collapsed right lung. Treatment of this injury required surgical perforation of Luann's ribcage and the insertion of a tube to reinflate the lung. The treatment necessitated Luann's hospitalization for a period of six days.
Konrad's August 24 assault was the basis for his conviction of assault in the second degree. Under AS 11.41.210(a)(2), second-degree assault occurs when a ""person recklessly causes serious physical injury to another person."" On appeal, Konrad argues that the evidence below was insufficient to establish serious physical injury.
""Serious physical injury"" may be proved, inter alia, by evidence establishing that the defendant inflicted physical injury by ""an act performed under circumstances that create a substantial risk of death."" AS 11.81.900(b)(50)(A). This definition of serious physical injury focuses on the circumstances in which the defendant performed the act that caused physical injury. The fortuity of prompt medical treatment and speedy recovery by the victim is not a primary consideration. See James v. State, 671 P.2d at 888-89.
At trial, Dr. David D. Anderson testified that Luann Konrad sustained a pneumotho-rax, or a collapsed lung caused by air seeping into the chest cavity. Dr. Anderson characterized the injury as life threatening. He likened the risk of death to that involved in open heart surgery. Despite repeated cross-examination by Konrad's counsel, Dr. Anderson steadfastly refused to say that the risk of death posed to Luann Konrad by her injury was not substantial. To the contrary, the doctor testified that ""there is a definite risk of death, there is no getting around it."""
"TERRORISTIC THREATENING
On November 20, 1986, George and Luann Konrad spoke to each other by telephone. Their conversation lasted for about one-half hour. During the second half of the conversation, Konrad repeatedly threatened to kill his wife if she prevailed in a child custody dispute that was then pend ing in the superior court. Luann Konrad recorded the entire conversation. Konrad's death threats served as the basis for his conviction of terroristic threatening.
A. Failure to Present Exculpatory Evidence to the Grand Jury
During the grand jury hearing on Konrad's case, the prosecution played only the latter portion of the recorded conversation between Konrad and his wife. That was the portion in which Konrad made his threatening statements. Prior to trial Konrad unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the terroristic threatening charges, arguing that the prosecution breached its duty to present exculpatory evidence by failing to play the entire recorded conversation, as well as two prior conversations between Konrad and Luann that were recorded on the same tape.
Konrad renews his argument on appeal. He contends that the first portion of the tape would have tended to establish that Luann was not particularly afraid of Konrad and that she in effect goaded him into making the threats upon her life.
We are unpersuaded by Konrad's argument. While the prosecution must disclose exculpatory evidence to the grand jury, Frink v. State, 597 P.2d 154, 164 (Alaska 1979), there is no duty to present ""possibly favorable"" evidence or to develop potential theories of defense. Abruska v. State, 705 P.2d 1261, 1272 (Alaska App.1985); Tookak v. State, 648 P.2d 1018, 1021 (Alaska App.1982)."
"It is theoretically possible that the un-played portions of the tape might have had some indirect relevance on the issue of Konrad's specific intent to place Luann Konrad in fear. A person who is provoked and makes threats out of anger may act without a specific intent to cause fear. Thus, if the earlier portion of the recorded conversation revealed significant provocation, it should arguably have been played to provide a context from which the grand jury could have determined Konrad's intent in making the threats contained in the latter part of the recording.
In this connection, however, our review of the recorded conversation convinces us that the unplayed portion of the tape could have had no substantial exculpatory value. To the extent that the unplayed portion reveals any provocation of Konrad by Luann Konrad, that provocation is decidedly slight in comparison to the threats of death that followed. Given the marginal extent of provocation on the unplayed portion of the tape and the repeated and apparently deliberate nature of Konrad's subsequent death threats, we are satisfied that a playing of the full conversation would not have been substantially favorable to the defense in this case. We find no error.
B. Lesser-Included Offense
Konrad was initially charged by information with attempted coercion, in violation of AS 11.41.530(a)(1) and AS 11.31.100(d)(4). Because coercion is a class C felony, attempted coercion constitutes a class A misdemeanor. AS 11.31.100(d)(4). In presenting Konrad's case to the grand jury, the prosecution elected to ask for a charge of terroristic threatening instead of attempted coercion. The offense is a class C felony. See AS 11.56.810(b)."
"Is there — are there other avenues of potential counts or charges for threatening people's lives?
The prosecutor responded:
We considered other charges, but unfortunately there's not anything that's a real good fit, and the legislature amended terroristic threatening; it used to not include threats that were made to people and their family members, and they recently amended it so it seems to me that that's probably the closest fit that we're going to get.
In moving to dismiss the indictment below, Konrad argued that the prosecutor was obligated to submit the crime of attempted coercion to the grand jury as a possible lesser-included offense of terroristic threatening. Konrad repeats this argument on appeal. He acknowledges that there is normally no duty to offer the grand jury a lesser-included offense when sufficient evidence is presented to support a greater offense. See Oxereok v. State, 611 P.2d 913, 916-18 (Alaska 1980); Castillo v. State, 614 P.2d 756, 763 (Alaska 1980). Nevertheless, Konrad insists that an instruction on attempted coercion was necessary in the present case in light of the grand jury's specific request for possible alternative charges.
In our view, however, the prosecution's response to the grand juror's inquiry was reasonable. ""[A]s legal advisor to the grand jury, the prosecutor may appropriately explain the law and express an opinion on the legal significance of the evidence...."" I Standards for Criminal Justice, Standard 3-3.5 (2d ed. 1980). Here, the prosecutor's opinion that terroristic threatening appeared to be the ""best fit"" was accurate."
"This additional burden would have placed the prosecution at a significant disadvantage. Because Konrad may well have intended to place Luann Konrad in fear without actually intending to coerce her into relinquishing her claim of custody, he might have been found guilty of terror-istic threatening without also being found guilty of attempted coercion. Under the circumstances, then, attempted coercion was not a lesser-included offense of terror-istic threatening, and the prosecution's advice that terroristic threatening was a ""better fit"" was not unreasonable.
C. Vagueness
Konrad argues for the first time on appeal that Alaska's terroristic threatening statute is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. In relevant part, AS 11.56.-810(a)(2) provides:
(a) A person commits the crime of ter-roristic threatening if the person
(2) with intent to place another person in fear of death or serious physical injury to the person or the person's immediate family, makes repeated threats to cause death or serious physical injury to another person.
Konrad's claim of vagueness is premised on the statute's use of the word ""repeated,"" which modifies the word ""threats."" According to Konrad, ""repeated"" is ambiguous, because it may be understood to mean either a threat uttered more than one time in a single conversation or a threat made on more than one occasion. Konrad claims that this ambiguity deprived him of fair notice as to what conduct on his part was prohibited. He also claims that the ambiguity invites arbitrary enforcement of the statute."
"""Repeated"" is not defined in Alaska's revised criminal code. Its ordinary definition must be considered. Gibson v. State, 719 P.2d 687, 690 (Alaska App.1986). According to Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, ""repeated"" means: ""said, made, done, or happening again, or again and again."" We find little ambiguity in this definition. In context, a ""repeated threat"" is simply a threat made more than once. See, e.g., State v. Diede, 319 N.W.2d 818, 821 (S.D.1982).
While the ordinary meaning of ""repeated threats"" certainly encompasses a threat made on more than one occasion, there is no reason to suppose, as Konrad suggests, that these words can reasonably be read to exclude threats made more than once on a single occasion. The Colorado Supreme Court, relying on the ordinary meaning of ""repeatedly,"" rejected a vagueness claim almost identical to the one advanced by Konrad here. See People ex rel. VanMeveren v. County Court, Etc., 191 Colo. 201, 551 P.2d 716 (1976). In reaching its conclusion, the court said:
""Repeatedly"" is a word of such common understanding that its meaning is not vague. It simply means in the context of this statute that the defendant used insulting, taunting or challenging language more than one time.
Id. 551 P.2d at 720.
We find no sound basis for refusing to apply the ordinary meaning of ""repeated"" in the present case. The challenged portion of Alaska's terroristic threatening statute was adopted by the legislature in 1984, apparently without commentary. See Chapter 108, § 1, SLA 1984. Of the various other states having terroristic threatening statutes similar to Alaska's, almost none require more than a single threat. See generally Model Penal Code § 211.3 commentary at 206 n. 8 (1980); Annotation, Validity And Construction of Terroristic Threat Statutes, 45 A.L.R. 4th 949 (1986). Accordingly, there seems to be no statutory history in Alaska or general trend elsewhere indicating a need to restrict the plain meaning of Alaska's statute."
"It is uncertain whether Alaska's terroristic threatening provision was patterned after Hawaii's. For purposes of construing Alaska's statute, the issue seems unimportant. Assuming Alaska's statute was drawn from Hawaii's, our legislature's election to depart from the wording of the Hawaii statute by requiring a ""repeated"" threat rather than a threat ""on more than one occasion,"" would appear to be significant. Assuming Alaska's statute was not taken from the Hawaii code, then Hawaii's decision to require a threat ""on more than one occasion"" would be significant only insofar as it establishes that the Alaska legislature could easily have drafted a statute to require a threat on more than one occasion had it wanted to do so.
While we hold that the terroristic threatening statute is not impermissibly vague when ""repeated"" is accorded its ordinary meaning, we nonetheless recognize that applying the literal definition of the word may create problems in certain unusual circumstances in which a question might arise as to whether a single statement contains more than one threat. The obvious purpose in requiring that a threat be ""repeated"" before becoming a terroristic threat within the meaning of AS 11.56.-810(a)(2) is to assure that the harsh sanction of felony prosecution will not be visited upon a person for making a rash statement out of transitory anger or in the heat of passion. This purpose is reflected in the reading generally given to terroristic threatening provisions in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., Annot., supra, 45 A.L.R. 4th § 31. Accordingly, strict adherence to the literal meaning of ""repeated threats"" will be inappropriate in some situations."
"In the present case, there was ample evidence to permit a finding that Konrad made ""repeated threats"" to take Luann Konrad's life. The recording of the telephone conversation reveals that Konrad threatened to kill his wife numerous times. The threats were not made in a continuous manner. Rather, they were repeated over a period of more than fifteen minutes. Konrad's threats were separated not only in time, but also by the subject matter of the conversation. The individual threats were interspersed with discussion concerning other matters. Sufficient time elapsed between the threats to permit reflection, and the threats were uttered in a composed and calculated tone of voice.
Konrad's conduct is thus within the core prohibition of the statute. To the extent that there is any potential for uncertainty in some situations, Konrad's case falls well outside the area of uncertainty. See, e.g., Levshakoff v. State, 565 P.2d 504, 508 (Alaska 1977). We reject both Konrad's vagueness argument and his related contention that insufficient evidence was presented below to support his conviction for terroristic threatening.
OTHER ISSUES
Konrad raises two additional issues that do not require extended discussion. First, he contends that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of Keith Wiger. Wiger's testimony, however, was offered for the sole purpose of impeaching Luann Konrad's testimony concerning an entirely collateral matter. We find no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of his testimony. See, e.g., Moss v. State, 620 P.2d 674, 676-77 (Alaska 1980); Oswald v. State, 715 P.2d 276, 278-79 (Alaska App.1986)."
"After Verdict. If by reason of absence from the district . the judge before whom the action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the court after a verdict or finding of guilt, any other judge regularly sitting . may perform those duties; but if such other judge is satisfied that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at the trial or for any other reason, he may in his discretion grant a new trial.
Judge Buckalew denied Konrad's motion and proceeded to impose sentence.
Judge Buckalew's denial of a new trial did not amount to an abuse of discretion. Criminal Rule 25(c) vests a newly-assigned judge with discretion to order a new trial if that judge ""is satisfied that he cannot perform those duties [i.e., sentencing] because he did not preside at the trial or for any other reason...."" Here, there is no indication that Judge Buckalew was unable to perform his duties. To the contrary, the record discloses that the judge thoroughly familiarized himself with the case by reviewing the entire record of trial proceedings. Even had he not reviewed the record, Judge Buckalew would have been in essentially the same position as any judge who imposes a sentence after a plea of guilty or no contest. Under the circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion.
The convictions for terroristic threatening and assault in the second degree are AFFIRMED. The conviction for assault in the third degree is VACATED. This case is REMANDED to the superior court, with directions to amend the judgment accordingly."
"""[D]eadly weapon"" means any firearm, or anything designed for and capable of causing death or serious physical injury, including a knife, an axe, a club, metal knuckles, or an explosive....
Under the definition of ""dangerous instrument"" set out in AS 11.81.900(b)(ll), any deadly weapon qualifies as a dangerous instrument, without regard to the circumstance in which it is actually used. The inherent danger posed by deadly weapons justifies their treatment as dangerous instruments without regard to actual use. See, e.g., Krasovich v. State, 731 P.2d 598 (Alaska App.1987). We emphasize that our discussion in the text is restricted to dangerous instruments that would not qualify within the statutory definition for a deadly weapon.
. Although the argument in the body of Konrad's briefs appears to be that attempted coercion is the lesser offense that the prosecution should have called to the attention of the grand jury, the statement of points on this issue in Konrad's opening brief refers to the class B misdemeanor of harassment, AS 11.61.120(a)(4), which prohibits threatening telephone calls that are made with intent to harass or annoy. Like attempted coercion, harassment is not a lesser-included offense of terroristic threatening under the circumstances of the present case. Harassment requires proof that the accused was the person who made the threatening telephone call and that the call was made with the intent to harass. In the present case, the recording made by Luann Konrad did not reveal who initially placed the call. Even assuming the state could have proved that it was Konrad, rather than his wife, who placed the call, it would still have had to prove that Konrad's original purpose in placing the call was to harass or annoy. In contrast, the crime of terroristic threatening required the state to prove only that Konrad's purpose was to instill fear of serious physical injury in his wife at the time he uttered the threatening remarks."
". The derivation table included in the Alaska Department of Law's Criminal Law Manual lists Hawaii Revised Statute 707-715 in connection with Alaska's terroristic threatening statute. This reference to the Hawaii statute is of questionable significance, however, because the derivation table does not necessarily indicate the actual source of any given Alaska statute. A preface to the derivation table cautions, in relevant part:
It should be noted that the derivation listing was compiled by the Criminal Division of the Department of Law after enactment of the revised code. Statutes from other jurisdictions that were actually considered by the Criminal Law Revision Subcommission are set out in a table appearing as an appendix to each volume of the six-part Tentative Draft of the code published by the Subcommission.
Id. at 6-1 — 6-2 (emphasis in original). The tentative draft contained no terroristic threatening provision. We note, moreover, that the derivation table referred to Hawaii Revised Statute 707-715 even before the terroristic statute was amended in 1984 to add subsection (a)(2), which for the first time added the provision requiring ""repeated threats.""
. Insofar as Konrad has claimed that AS 11.56.-810(a)(2) would permit arbitrary enforcement, he has failed to establish any history of arbitrary enforcement to support his claim. See, e.g., Summers v. Anchorage, 589 P.2d at 866-67; Holton v. State, 602 P.2d 1228, 1234 (Alaska 1979).
. The record discloses no efforts by Konrad's trial counsel to reschedule sentencing for a time when Judge Craske might have been available or to make other arrangements that might have allowed the sentencing hearing to be conducted by Judge Craske. Had trial counsel made such efforts, we believe that reassignment of the case for sentencing purposes would have amounted to error, absent compelling circumstances precluding the trial judge's participation. We emphasize, however, that on appeal Konrad does not argue that he should have been sentenced by Judge Craske. Rather, his only point is that he should have received a new trial before Judge Buckalew. Our holding addresses only that contention."
"SINGLETON, Judge.
A jury convicted Richard D. Robison of kidnapping, but accepted the affirmative defense that he released his victim without harming her. Consequently, the offense was reduced to a class A felony. AS 11.-41.300(d). The jury also convicted Robison of attempted sexual assault in the first degree. AS 11.41.410(a)(1); AS 11.31.-100(a). Robison, a first felony offender, was subject to a five-year presumptive term. AS 12.55.125(c)(1). The trial court rejected Robison's claim that his conduct was among the least serious within the definition of the offense, AS 12.55.155(d)(9), and found instead that the conduct was among the most serious. AS 12.55.-155(c)(10). Robison received a sentence of ten years with five years suspended. He appeals his conviction and sentence. We affirm Robison's conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand for imposition of the presumptive term.
FACTS
In October 1986, C.R. was living and working in Anchorage. She rode the bus to work each day and had to change buses at the University Mall. During the afternoon of October 27, 1986, she had taken the bus to the mall and had gone inside the mall while waiting for her connecting bus. As she walked back out through the mall parking lot towards the bus stop, a man in a small pickup truck asked her for directions to Tudor Road. C.R. answered the man and then went across the street to the bus stop. She waited a few minutes and became concerned that she had missed her bus. She then went to a nearby phone booth to call her employer to say she was late."
"Robison testified at trial. He admitted that he had offered a ride to C.R. and requested that she ""suck his dick."" He denied having a gun or threatening C.R. with any object. He indicated that he was slowing down to let her out of the truck at her request, when she panicked and jumped out. He drove off.
DISCUSSION
Alaska Statute 11.41.300(a)(1)(C) provides in pertinent part that a person commits the crime of kidnapping if the person restrains another person with the intent to sexually assault the other person. Particularly relevant to this case is AS 11.41.300(d), which provides as follows:
In a prosecution for kidnapping, it is an affirmative defense which reduces the crime to a class A felony that the defendant voluntarily caused the release of the victim alive in a safe place before arrest, or within 24 hours after arrest, without having caused serious physical injury to the victim and without having engaged in conduct described in AS 11.41.410(a)(1) or (2) [sexual assault in the first degree] or AS 11.41.420 [sexual assault in the second degree].
Also significant is AS 11.81.900(b)(1) which provides in relevant part:
In this title, unless otherwise specified or unless the context requires otherwise,
(1) ""affirmative defense"" means that
(A) some evidence must be admitted which places in issue the defense; and
(B) the defendant has the burden of establishing the defense by a preponderance of the evidence^]
Prior to sentencing, Robison filed notice of a mitigating factor and the state filed notice of aggravators. Robison contended that the conduct constituting his offense was among the least serious conduct included in the definition of the offense. AS 12.55.155(d)(9). The state contended that the conduct constituting the offense was among the most serious included in the offense ""because it was part of a series of five inappropriate approaches to women who did not know him."" AS 12.55.-155(c)(10)."
"The state concedes that this aggravating factor refers only to defendant's conduct in committing the offense and not to his propensity to commit similar crimes. In the state's view, however, Judge Ripley relied on the other contacts only as evidence indicating the character of the present assault. The state claims that in the judge's view, this evidence established that the defendant's act was not an impetuous isolated incident but a calculated approach, part of an ongoing plan to gain access to women as a means of sexually assaulting them. Finally, the state argues that Judge Ripley, in performing his role as sentencing judge, could disregard the jury's contrary conclusion regarding the victim's having been injured and could find that the defendant committed a more serious offense than that for which he was ultimately convicted. Monroe v. State, 752 P.2d 1017, 1021 (Alaska App.1988); Fee v. State, 656 P.2d 1202, 1204 (Alaska App.1982). See also Ridgely v. State, 739 P.2d 1299, 1302 (Alaska App.1987); Huckaby v. State, 632 P.2d 975, 976-77 (Alaska App.1981). In the state's view, Judge Ripley's rejection of the jury's finding would permit the conclusion that Robison's offense was among the most serious within the definition of the crime. See AS 12.55.155(c)(10); Braaten v. State, 705 P.2d 1311, 1322-23 (Alaska App.1985); Peetook v. State, 655 P.2d 1308, 1311-12 n. 3 (Alaska App.1982).
We reject these arguments. First, the jury's finding that Robison sustained his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he released his victim without harm was binding on the trial court. See Briggs v. State, 732 P.2d 1078, 1081 (Alaska 1987) (order suppressing breathalyzer test in criminal case operates as collateral estoppel in license revocation proceeding). Cases such as Schnecker v. State, 739 P.2d 1310, 1312-14 (Alaska App.1987), Ridgely and Huckaby are distinguishable. In those cases, the defendant either pled to a lesser offense, or was convicted of the lesser offense, rather than the greater, arguably because the jury had a reasonable doubt regarding the element that distinguished the greater and lesser offenses. In contrast, the jury in this case expressly found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the victim was released unharmed. In this circumstance, the trial court was bound by that finding."
"The judgment of the superior court is AFFIRMED. Robison's sentence is VACATED and this case REMANDED for resentencing to the presumptive term.
. Robison challenges both his sentence and his conviction on appeal. We briefly address his merit appeal in this footnote. His sentence appeal is discussed in the text of this decision. Robison challenges his conviction on two grounds. First, he argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the investigating officer signaled the prosecuting witness and thereby coached her during her testimony. The trial court noticed the officer's actions and brought it to counsel's attention. Defense counsel expressly waived any remedy, indicating that the jury was probably aware of the officer's actions and would hold it against the state. It would appear that counsel's conscious waiver of a remedy during trial would be binding on the defendant in the absence of ineffective assistance of counsel. Lanier v. State, 486 P.2d 981, 983-88 (Alaska 1971). Since counsel obviously had strategic reasons for foregoing a remedy, i.e., a cautionary instruction, we are not able to find either plain error or ineffective assistance of counsel. See Potts v. State, 712 P.2d 385, 394 n. 12 (Alaska App.1985). Robison notes that he brought a ""habeas corpus"" petition raising this issue after trial, which he contends should be construed as a motion for new trial. In Robison's view, by seeking ""habeas corpus,"" he brought the issue to the attention of the trial court and therefore should not be bound by the plain error rule. As we have seen, however, matters of trial strategy are within the waiver rule established in Lanier. In addition, the plain error rule applies to all objections which should have been made at trial. Clearly, the trial court gave Robison an opportunity to seek a remedy during trial. His failure to do so could not be cured by a post-trial motion for new trial or for ""habeas corpus."" Id. at 390 n. 8."
"OPINION
SINGLETON, Judge.
Darryl W. Sledge was convicted of one count of sexual assault in the first degree, an unclassified felony. AS 11.41.410(a)(1). He was sentenced to serve the applicable eight-year presumptive term. AS 12.55.-125(i)(l). Sledge appeals. We conclude that it is necessary to remand this case for a further hearing to determine whether Sledge was denied his constitutional right to confront his accuser.
FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
D.W., a fourteen-year-old girl, testified that on November 9, 1985, she accepted a ride with Darryl W. Sledge in his automobile. D.W. agreed to accompany Sledge to the store, and then Sledge was to take her home. D.W. testified that instead of taking her home as promised, Sledge purchased beer at the store and then drove her to a secluded place where he attempted to sexually assault her. He succeeded in penetrating her vagina with his finger. The sexual assault was interrupted by a passing police officer. Sledge recounted a substantially different story. He agreed that he gave D.W. a ride in his car, but contended that D.W. gave him money and he bought her a six-pack of beer. Sledge further stated that after leaving the store he and D.W. drove around so that D.W. could smoke a marijuana cigarette. Sledge claimed that he and D.W. got into an argument because she was drinking in his car. He stopped the car and poured out the beer she had opened. Sledge said that when the police arrived, D.W. panicked and jumped out of the ear. D.W.'s testimony that she was sexually assaulted was corroborated in part by medical testimony that she had a small cut on the lower part of her vagina."
"[D.W.] alleged that Sledge had sexually assaulted her in his vehicle. She denied consuming any alcohol or marijuana with Sledge. Sledge claimed that [D.W.] went with him voluntarily and consumed alcohol at her own request. [D.W.] informed the officers that she was a ward of the state. Therefore, she had been unwilling to violate any drinking laws with Sledge.
[D.W.] was the one who informed the officers of her legal custody status. Discovery of [D.W.'s] Child in Need of Aid file, both the court file and the Division of Family and Youth Services file, is necessary for Sledge to explore the possibility that [D.W.] is biased and motivated to shade or fabricate her testimony in order to avoid detrimental consequences for herself in the Child in Need of Aid case.
Sledge agreed that Superior Court Judge S.J. Buckalew, Jr., the omnibus hearing judge, should conduct an in camera inspection of the DFYS file to determine if anything in the file should be disclosed to Sledge. After conducting the in camera inspection, Judge Buckalew determined that nothing in the DFYS file should be disclosed to Sledge.
Superior Court Judge J. Justin Ripley substituted for Judge Buckalew at trial and sentencing. Based on Judge Buckalew's ruling that nothing in the DFYS file was discoverable, the state requested a protective order barring Sledge from inquiring into D.W.'s residence in a foster home during the course of trial. In response, defense counsel pointed out that:
[D.W.], in making the statement to the police, explaining why she did certain things, or did not do certain things, raised up the fact that she was a ward of the state and therefore to avoid getting in trouble she did not do certain things in the car with Mr. Sledge. And since she brought it up, I intend to ask her about that."
"Defense counsel responded:
Well, mostly motive and bias actually. As to — she's saying that she's under some sort of restriction. I don't know what the restrictions are, I don't know if — anything about that. But there is something there that she did not drink with Mr. Sledge, or accept what she claims is an offer of marijuana because she was a ward of the state. And she was afraid that if she violated whatever those conditions were, she would get in trouble with the state and with her foster parents.
Judge Ripley asked that no examination on the matter be conducted until a hearing out of the presence of the jury could be held to determine whether the evidence had any relevance. Judge Ripley did not review D.W.'s DFYS files, but he accepted Judge Buckalew's ruling on this matter, concluding that it was the law of the case unless relaxed at a later time.
After D.W. had testified on direct and cross-examination, the jury was excused and Sledge renewed his request to inquire into her wardship status. The defense counsel reasoned:
Your honor, my request is that I be allowed to — at least outside the presence of the jury to ask her about her — why she is a ward of the state. The reason is this. When the police officer — she was explaining to the police officer that I don't — I didn't take any marijuana, I told him I didn't want any and I wouldn't have any beer because I'm a ward of the state and that would violate my — whatever the . conditions were. I simply want to ask her . I assume it's a CINA situation. But I don't know why she is a — of course. And it may be entirely innocent. It may, however, be related to prior difficulties. I don't know whether her being there would result in some sort of adjudication against her. That's what I want to get to. And I know — and it may well be entirely innocent and not something that the jury should hear. It may well be, however — it may go toward motive or bias. I don't know. And I think we should at least ask her outside the presence [of the jury] and clarify that."
"That she didn't want — no, I don't want to smoke any marijuana because I'm not allowed to because I'm in the custody of the state. This is the statement that he wants to tap all this on to. So, even if it shows that she's in the custody of the state and she's under some kind of probation, all it shows is that she was telling the truth when she said that. It just drags in all these bad acts to confirm her statement, which is not before the jury.
Judge Ripley concluded that Judge Buck-alew's prior ruling barring discovery of D.W.'s wardship status should stand. Thus, the ruling precluded the.cross-examination requested by Sledge.
Additionally, on direct examination of Sledge, defense counsel attempted to elicit testimony from Sledge that D.W. told him she was a ward of the state. Sledge had been explaining his version of what occurred when the police arrived. The state objected, and outside the presence of the jury, Sledge told the court the statement he wanted to make. He was allowed to say, in front of the jury, that D.W. panicked and jumped out of the car, saying, ""I don't want to get my parents in trouble."" Sledge wanted to testify that D.W. said she didn't want to get her parents in trouble because she was a ward of the state. He also wanted to testify that immediately before jumping out of the car D.W. said, ""I'm in . trouble now."" Judge Ripley ruled that Sledge could mention neither that D.W. told him she was a ward of the state nor that she was in foster care. The jury found Sledge guilty of sexual assault in the first degree. AS 11.41.410(a)(1). No statutory, aggravating, or mitigating factors were proposed at trial. Sledge, however, requested that his case be referred to the three-judge panel. AS 12.55.165-175. Judge Ripley denied Sledge's request, and imposed the applicable eight-year presumptive term. AS 12.55.125(i)(l)."
"Sledge first argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence regarding D.W.'s status as a ward of the state. Sledge argued that D.W.'s statements regarding her wardship status were made at the scene and reflected her state of mind at the time she first told the police that Sledge assaulted her. In Sledge's view, this information could be relevant to show why D.W. apparently had a particularized fear that, if caught in the activity Sledge said she had engaged in, i.e., drinking beer and smoking marijuana, she could be subject to adverse consequences that would not be present if she were not a ward of the state. Consequently, in Sledge's view, this would show D.W.'s bias and motive to fabricate. D.W. might have hoped that by falsely accusing Sledge of sexual assault, she would divert attention from her own activities and gain sympathy, rather than sanction, from the authorities. Sledge claims that by not allowing D.W.'s foster care status into evidence, the trial court denied Sledge his right to cross-examine the prosecution's witness in violation of the confrontation clauses of the United States and the Alaska constitutions. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Alaska Const., art. 1, § 11. See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974); Jackson v. State, 695 P.2d 227, 230-33 (Alaska App.1985); Fox v. State, 685 P.2d 1267, 1272-73 (Alaska App.1984).
The state argues that the evidence was irrelevant and, even if relevant, its probative value was outweighed by the prejudice involved in violating D.W.'s privacy with regard to her status as a ward of the state. See Alaska Evidence Rule 403; Larson v. State, 656 P.2d 571, 575 (Alaska App.1982) (Alaska Evidence Rule 403, when properly applied, does not violate a defendant's constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him and present evidence in his own behalf)."
"We are concerned that Sledge may have been restricted in his ability to present evidence to show the victim's motive to fabricate, and that he was unable to adequately present his theory of defense to the jury. Sledge was only able to make a generalized argument as to D.W.'s motive to testify falsely. Essentially, Sledge was only left with the argument that anyone in D.W.'s position would have a motive to testify falsely. It is possible that Sledge was prevented from making the much stronger argument that D.W. had a special fear of adverse consequences because she was a ward of the state and under foster care. Sledge could argue that another young woman who was not a ward of the state would not have the same fear under similar circumstances. D.W. attached great importance to her wardship status. This is indicated by her statements to the police and her fear that adverse consequences would result if she had voluntarily consumed alcohol and smoked marijuana. Thus, her wardship status strongly suggests that she had a motive to fabricate. Consequently, the exclusion of evidence concerning D.W.'s status as a ward of the state may have unduly infringed on Sledge's confrontation rights. We therefore remand this case for a hearing to enable counsel to voir dire D.W. regarding her statements to the police and her understanding of the circumstances surrounding her wardship status. If the court concludes on remand that a jury could reasonably conclude that D.W. did tell the police she would not take drugs or use alcohol because she was a ward of the state, Sledge should be granted a new trial so that a jury can consider the effect of such statements. This could indicate D.W.'s state of mind and might support an inference that she had a motive to falsely accuse Sledge of a sexual assault. The state may be correct that D.W.'s concerns about her wardship status would motivate her to refrain from alcohol and marijuana and, thus, corroborate her claims. However, as Sledge points out, it might also motivate her to lie about her activity with Sledge if, in fact, she had consumed drugs and alcohol and was concerned about the consequences of her conduct being discovered. In such cases, it was for the jury to determine the true interplay between D.W.'s state of mind and the accuracy of her testimony."
"The trial court should address one additional issue on remand. Sledge argues that he should have had access to any information in D.W.'s DFYS and CINA files that would be relevant to show her bias or motive to fabricate. The state argued at trial that only juvenile adjudications relevant to D.W.'s truth and veracity should be discoverable. See Alaska Evidence Rule 609(e). At the time Judge Buckalew reviewed the files, he failed to indicate what type of information he viewed as discoverable. In his findings after remand, however, Judge Buckalew indicated that he viewed the material with the intent to disclose only material relating to the witness' credibility and veracity. It appears that a broader standard for disclosure is required.
In Braham v. State, 571 P.2d 631 (Alaska 1977), the Alaska Supreme Court considered the state's duty to disclose otherwise privileged information to a criminal defendant and stated that only relevant evidence must be disclosed. The court explained that the term ""relevant"" encompassed both logical relevance and materiality. Id. at 643 n. 17. Nondisclosure, the court indicated, would be proper only if the prosecution showed that disclosure would be inconsistent with enforcement or protection of the privacy interests of the individual, and if the information was not relevant to the defense. ""Disclosure is . required if the judge's in camera inspection showed that the material was relevant to the defense — whether or not the prosecutor had demonstrated that discovery would be inconsistent with enforcement or protection efforts."" Id. at 643. Relevant evidence, in the context of this case, would seem to include evidence showing D.W.'s bias or motive to fabricate."
"With regard to the standard of disclosure, the Court stated that any material evidence should be disclosed to the defendant. Material evidence means any evidence where ""there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceedings would have been different. A 'reasonable probability' is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."" Id. 107 S.Ct. at 1001 (quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3383-84, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)). In his concurring opinion, however, Justice Blackmun points out that evidence which could be used to impeach a witness by demonstrating bias would be within the court's definition of materiality. Ritchie, 107 S.Ct. at 1006 n. 2 (Blackmun, J., concurring). We agree with this conclusion. Therefore, on remand, the judge reviewing D.W.'s DFYS and CINA files should disclose to Sledge any information that is relevant to show D.W.'s bias or motive to fabricate, as well as any other relevant evidence.
One additional point needs clarification. In Ritchie, the Supreme Court stated that, ""the duty to disclose is ongoing; information that may be deemed immaterial upon original examination may become important as proceedings progress, and the court would be obligated to release information material to the fairness of the trial."" Ritchie, 107 S.Ct. at 1003. In the present case, Judge Buckalew reviewed the files, but Judge Ripley presided over the case at trial. To comply with the ongoing duty of disclosure, the trial judge, at trial, must review the files. Consequently, the trial judge, on remand, should review the files to determine whether there was any discoverable material."
". It was unclear from the original record exactly what files Judge Buckalew inspected. This issue was remanded to Judge Buckalew for clarification. After this issue was remanded, DFYS was ordered to turn over all of D.W.'s files. According to Judge Buckalew's findings after remand, DFYS had turned over additional files that were not turned over to Judge Buckalew prior to trial. Consequently, Judge Buckalew did not have an opportunity to review all of D.W.'s DFYS files prior to trial.
. D.W.'s DFYS and CINA records are confidential, and access to them can be had ""only with the court's permission and only by persons having a legitimate interest in them."" AS 47.10.-090(a). The use of this information to impeach D.W. by showing her motive to fabricate would appear to give Sledge a legitimate interest in the records. Therefore, if there was information in the files that could be used to impeach D.W., then the statute would allow disclosure.
. On appeal, Sledge raises two additional issues. First, Sledge argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the case for violation of Alaska Criminal Rule 45. This issue is foreclosed by Lindsay v. State, 698 P.2d 659, 662-63 (Alaska App.1985). Second, Sledge also argues that the trial court erred in refusing to refer his case to the three-judge panel for sentencing. Our decision to remand this case for further proceedings may render sentencing issues moot. Consequently, we decline to comment upon them at this time. Should the trial court, on remand, reinstate Sledge's conviction, Sledge may reinstate his sentencing appeal in this court."
"MATTHEWS, Chief Justice.
On May 20, 1983, the State of Alaska filed a complaint against Oliver Hofstad, Sarah Hofstad, and the City of Petersburg, seeking to take, by eminent domain, property owned by the Hofstads in Petersburg. The state also filed a declaration of taking, and deposited $27,900 into the registry of the court. The Hofstads filed an answer and counterclaim on June 16, 1983. On July 13, 1983, the state sent to the Hofs-tads a stipulation for disbursement of the funds. This stipulation required the signature of a representative of the City of Petersburg acknowledging that the city had no claim against the condemned premises. The Hofstads did not return the stipulation to the state until January 3, 1984.
In September 1985, the Hofstads and the state stipulated to a settlement of the case. The parties agreed that $30,450 should be paid as just compensation for the taking of the property. The state also agreed to pay certain sums of interest on the award. The parties disagreed, however, as to whether the state should be required to pay interest on the amount of the state's initial deposit of $27,900 for the period from June 16, 1983 through January 3, 1984.
On November 8, 1985, the Hofstads moved for an award of interest on the sum that was deposited by the court. The Hofs-tads argued that the state should have informed them of their right to withdraw funds without prejudice. In addition, the Hofstads argued that the state's refusal to comply with certain discovery requests impeded their ability to withdraw the funds. The trial court ruled that the ""delay of withdrawal of funds was solely due to actions of the Hofstads, and not the state, [and therefore the Hofstads are not entitled to] interest during the period in question."""
"The Hofstads make three arguments as to why they are entitled to prejudgment interest on the amount deposited with the court. First, they argue that they were not free to withdraw the funds because the state did not send the stipulation regarding the release of the funds until July 13, 1983, and that the stipulation required a release from the city. Second, they argue that AS 09.55.440 does not allow risk-free withdrawal of funds because it requires a con-demnee to return funds plus interest if the final award by the court is less than the amount withdrawn. Finally, the Hofstads argue that the state's failure to furnish discovery prejudiced them, and prevented them from making an informed decision with regard to the withdrawal of the funds. Each of these arguments lacks merit.
In Russian Orthodox Catholic Church of N. Am. v. Alaska State Hous. Auth., 498 P.2d 737 (Alaska 1972), we discussed the payment of interest on funds deposited with the court: ""In situations where the failure to withdraw funds on deposit in the registry of the court is attributable to the delay of the property owner, no interest should be allowed on the portion of the award so deposited."" Id. at 743. We then cited, in a footnote, two cases in which the failure of the property owner to apply for the withdrawal of funds on deposit was held to constitute a delay attributable to the property owner and eliminated the right to interest. See Atlantic Coastline Rail Co. v. United States, 132 F.2d 959, 962-63 (5th Cir.1943); United States v. 0.45 Acres, 151 F.2d 114 (2nd Cir.1945)."
"The Hofstads first argue that they were not free to withdraw the funds because the state did not send its stipulation for release of the funds until July 13, 1983, and that that stipulation required a release from the city. This argument lacks merit. Alaska Statute 09.55.440(b) allows a party to make a motion to the court for withdrawal of funds on deposit. The Hofstads could have made this motion any time after making an appearance in the case. Thus, it was unnecessary for the Hofstads to wait for the stipulation from the state prior to withdrawing funds. As the Hofstads never made a motion pursuant to AS 09.55.440, any delay in withdrawal is attributable to them and the timing with regard to the state's stipulation is irrelevant.
The Hofstads next argue that AS 09.55.440 does not allow a risk-free withdrawal of funds. Alaska Statute 09.55.-440(b) requires that if the actual amount awarded as just compensation is less than the amount withdrawn, then the con-demnee must pay back the excess to the state. The Hofstads argue that this may put the condemnee in ""double jeopardy:""
If the condemnee withdraws the deposited money and the court enters a judgment that just compensation is less than the state has estimated (and deposited); the condemnee will have to repay the excess to the state (plus interest). A more prudent course is to leave the money on deposit until a final order fixes the exact amount of just compensation.
This argument also lacks merit. If the condemnee is truly concerned about having to pay an excess back to the state, it is free to withdraw the funds on deposit and place them in an interest bearing account. In this way, if the condemnee is required to pay such an excess, the funds will be readily available."
"OPINION
MATTHEWS, Justice.
Echo Bay Alaska, Inc., applied to the City and Borough of Juneau in November 1990 for a large mine permit for the AJ Mine. The proposed mine is located four miles from downtown Juneau. The tailings that will result from the processed ore are to be pumped into a tailings pond created by constructing a dam in Sheep Creek Valley. The proposed dam mil be 332 feet high and 750 feet long. If the mine goes into production 100 million tons of tailings are expected to be produced and pumped into the pond. The excess water from the tailings pond will be discharged into Gastineau Channel. The discharge from the tailings pond to the channel could be as great as 250 cubic feet per second."
"Appellants, Thane Neighborhood Association (TNA) and Alaskans for Juneau (AEJ), appealed the Commission's decision to the City and Borough of Juneau Assembly (CBJ) on June 7, 1993. Echo Bay was granted permission to participate as a party. The CBJ heard oral argument on August 30, 1993, and issued a decision denying the appeal on September 22, 1993. TNA and AFJ then appealed to the superior court and Echo Bay was permitted to intervene. On October 26, 1994, the superior court affirmed the decision of the CBJ. In this appeal, the appellants argue that the ""CBJ impermissi-bly used a 'phased' approach in approving"" the permit and that the CBJ's finding that issuance of the permit complied with standards set forth in the CBJ mining ordinance is not supported by substantial evidence. In December 1995 CBJ and Echo Bay filed a supplemental brief, and TNA and AFJ filed a response addressing the issue of whether the ""Planning Commission [could] assure future compliance with the substantive standards for mining operations . by imposing permit conditions requiring future performance rather than by demanding pre-application-approval demonstration of future ability to comply.""
THE CODE
The review of large mine permits is governed by the Code of the City and Borough of Juneau (CC & B J) 49.65 (1989). CC & B J 49.65.110 provides in part: ""It is the purpose of this article to foster the development of a safe, healthy and environmentally sound mining industry while protecting the overall interests of public health, safety and the general welfare and minimizing the environmental and surface effects of mining projects for which an exploration notice or mining permit is required."""
"be submitted in the form of a report containing sufficient information so that the department can, after reviewing the application, evaluate, in accordance with the standards of subsection 49.65.135(a), the impacts[ ] described in this subsection that the mining operation may have on the city and borough. The application shall contain a map on a scale of 1:63,360 or a more detailed scale, a description of the mine site and affected surface; a description and timetable of the proposed mining operation, including all roads, buildings, processing and related facilities; a description and timetable of proposed reclamation of affected surface; a description of proposals for the sealing of open shafts, adits and tunnels upon the completion or temporary cessation of mining operations; a description of methods to be used to control, treat, transport and dispose of hazardous substances, sewage and solid waste; and a description of other potential environmental, health, safety and general welfare impacts, as well as neighboring property impacts and measures to be taken to mitigate their adverse effects. The application shall also contain additional information normally prepared by the operator for its feasibility studies and mining plans, including information establishing the right to use the affected surface, labor force char- acteristies and timing, payroll projections, anticipated duration of the mining operation, construction schedules, infrastructure description, and other information reasonably requested by the department in the preapplication conference held pursuant to Section 49.15.330(b)_"
"CC & B J 49.65.130(f) requires the Community Development Department (Department) to conduct an application review, which
shall include, but not be limited to, the following determinations: whether air and water quality will be maintained in accordance with federal, state, and city and borough laws, rules and regulations; where sewage, solid waste, hazardous and toxic materials will be properly contained and disposed of in accordance with federal, state, and city and borough laws, rules and regulations; the extent to which the operator will agree to mitigate adverse impacts on the city and borough; whether the mining operation will be conducted in such a way as to minimize safety hazards to the extent reasonably practicable and will mitigate adverse impacts on the public and on neighboring properties such as those from traffic overloading, noise, dust, unsightly visual aspects, surface subsidence, avalanches, landslides and erosion; and whether appropriate historic sites will be protected.[ ]
CC & BJ 49.65.130(f) further provides:
The department shall form a recommendation as to whether the permit should be approved_ The department's recommendation may include such conditions or stipulations as the department deems to be reasonably necessary to mitigate any adverse environmental, health, safety, or general welfare impacts which may result from the proposed mining operation.... If the [planning] commission determines that the application, with stipulations or conditions[ ] as appropriate, satisfies the standards of Sections 49.65.135 and 49.15.330, it shall approve the application. ."
"STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE OF PERMITS AND CONDUCT OF OPERATIONS. (a) In determining whether to recommend issuance of a permit, the [community development] department shall require that:
(1) The mining operations be conducted in accordance with this article, Section 49.15.330,[ ] and any other applicable provisions of the city and borough code in such a way as to mitigate adverse environmental, health, safety and general welfare impacts;
(2) Air and water quality be maintained in accordance with federal, state, and city and borough laws, rules and regulations;
(3) Hazardous and toxic materials, sewage, and solid waste be properly contained and disposed of in accordance with applicable federal, state, and city and borough, laws, rules and regulations;
(4) The operator conduct all mining operations according to the standards of the city and borough, as contained in this article, Section 49.15.330, the permit, and any other applicable provisions of the city and borough code, so as to minimize to the extent reasonably practicable safety hazards and to control and mitigate adverse impacts on the public and neighboring properties, such as from traffic overloading, noise, dust, unsightly visual as pects, surface subsidence, avalanches, landslides and erosion;
(5) Appropriate historic sites designated as significant by the city and borough be protected;
(6) Reclamation of the affected surface be in accordance with the approved reclamation plan of the operator; and
(7) With respect to a large mine permit application, the operator negotiate and enter into a mitigation agreement with the city and borough...."
"THE LARGE MINE PERMIT
After making its determination, the Commission issued a notice of decision, granting approval for the application for a large mine permit subject to a set of conditions. The notice of decision lists the six requirements that are applicable to all conditional use permits as set forth at CC & BJ 49.15.330 and the twenty-one requirements set forth in the mining ordinance (CC & BJ 49.65.100-195), and states its findings for each of these requirements.
TNA and AFJ argue that the findings and conditions in the notice of decision evidence a lack of compliance with the code. They argue that the CBJ used a "" 'phased' approach in approving the large mine permit."" They point to three ways in which they believe the CBJ engaged in phasing. First, the Commission withheld approval of the dam, the tailings pond and marine water discharges until further information was provided, yet granted the permit for the remainder of the project. Second, the Commission approved the permit, yet required Echo Bay to provide further information on certain matters. Third, the Commission imposed as a condition that Echo Bay obtain necessary permits from other agencies.
Echo Bay and CBJ argue that this phasing is consistent with the code. CBJ argues ""[t]he purpose of the mining ordinance and the Commission is to grant permits, not to deny them."" CBJ and Echo Bay argue that ""the CBJ mining ordinance does not vest the commission with discretion to disapprove a large mine permit application when the standards for permit issuance have been met,"" relying on CC & BJ 49.65.130(f), which states that ""if the commission determines that the application, with stipulations or conditions as appropriate, satisfies the standards of Sections 49.65.135 and 49.15.330, it shall approve the application."" (Emphasis added.)"
"DISCUSSION
This court must determine to what extent the City and Borough of Juneau's code allows phasing when evaluating large mine permit applications. This is a question of statutory interpretation which does not involve agency expertise. Thus, this court will use its independent judgment. See Marlow v. Municipality of Anchorage, 889 P.2d 599, 602 n. 1 (Alaska 1995) (reviewing zoning commission's and board's constructions of zoning ordinance under independent judgment standard, as issues presented were ""pure questions of statutory construction which d[id] not involve agency expertise"").
A. Did the Commission Err by Granting a Large Mine Permit Which Excluded the Tailings Dam and Impoundment and Wastewater Discharge?
In this case, CC & BJ 49.65.135(a)(2) requires that ""water quality be maintained in accordance with federal, state, and city and borough laws, rules and regulations."" In its findings concerning the AJ Mine, the Commission stated that it could not ""conclusively determine at this time with current information that the proposed treatment system will maintain water quality in accordance with federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations."" The Commission further found that ""[t]he available data shows that the federal limit for total suspended solids (TSS) will not be met by the marine water discharge."" CC & BJ 49.65.135(a)(4) provides that a mine operator must ""conduct all mining operations . so as to minimize to the extent reasonably practicable safety hazards."" The staff had various concerns about the safety of the AJ Mine's proposed tailings dam."
"While the Juneau code does have provisions allowing the Commission to put conditions on a permit, see CC & BJ 49.15.330(g), 49.65.130(f), there is nothing in the code to support granting the permit for a project as a whole, while excepting one part of a project. Past decisions of this court make clear that phasing a project by permitting it in stages is disfavored.
Three of our recent cases provide considerable guidance as to what sorts of permit approval ""phasing"" techniques are appropriate and what kinds are not: Trustees for Alaska v. Gorsuch, 835 P.2d 1239 (Alaska 1992); Trustees for Alaska v. State, Department of Natural Resources, 851 P.2d 1340 (Alaska 1993); and Kuitsarak Corp. v. Swope, 870 P.2d 387 (Alaska 1994). In Gorsuch, we held that in granting mining permits, ""[Department of Natural Resources (DNR) ] may not ignore cumulative effects of mining and related support facilities . by permitting facilities separately."" 835 P.2d at 1246. We ruled that when DNR reviews a mining permit application, it must ""consider the probable cumulative impact of all anticipated activities which will be a part of a 'surface coal mining operation,' whether or not the activities are part of the permit under review."" Id. ""If DNR determines that the cumulative impact is problematic,"" we stated, ""the problems must be resolved before the initial permit is approved."" Id.
We explained that ""[tjhis type of 'concept approval' is necessary to avoid a situation where, because of industry investment and reliance upon a past mining permit approval, DNR might feel compelled to approve a subsequent permit for a related but environmentally unsound facility."" Id. at 1246 n. 6. We added that ""[i]n some cases, this may require concurrent, as opposed to serial, review of separate, related permit applications,"" while ""[i]n other cases, anticipated problems resulting from cumulative impacts may require that approval of an initial permit be conditioned upon satisfactory resolution of the problems anticipated in subsequent permits."" Id."
"Justice Rabinowitz contended that ""[e]ourts have disallowed segmentation of a proposed project . to assure that the cumulative effects of the project are adequately considered_"" Id. at 1251. Justice Rabi-nowitz cited Thomas v. Peterson, 753 F.2d 754, 760 (9th Cir.1985), for the proposition that ""allowing consideration of cumulative impacts after a portion of [a] project is already approved"" swings the balance in favor of project approval even if the project would have been disapproved had all components of the project been considered in the initial permit application. Gorsuch, 835 P.2d at 1251.
In Trustees for Alaska v. State, Department of Natural Resources, 851 P.2d 1340, 1341 (Alaska 1993) (Camden Bay II), DNR's approval of a sale of oil and gas leases was challenged. A regulation required DNR to identify known geophysical hazard areas, and prohibited approval of development in such areas until measures to minimize geophysical hazards were provided. Id. at 1343. DNR identified the entire sale area as a geophysical hazard area. Id. DNR intended to consider particular geophysical hazards on a lease-site-by-lease-site basis, requiring lessees to submit plans to mitigate potential geophysical hazards before approval to develop a specific lease site would be given. Id. at 1343-44 & n. 7.
We disapproved DNR's approach. We held that DNR was required to identify known or substantially possible hazard areas before approving the lease sale as a whole. Id. at 1344-45. We explained that ""deferring a careful and detailed look at particularized geophysical hazards to later stages of the development process . entails certain practical risks."" Id. at 1344. Such deferral ""may tend to mask appreciation of any cumulative environmental threat that would otherwise be apparent if DNR began with a detailed and comprehensive identification of [the] hazards."" Id. We again noted that ""the more segmented an assessment of environmental hazards [is], the greater the risk that prior permits will compel DNR to approve later, environmentally unsound permits."" Id."
"We also ruled in Camden Bay II, however, that DNR did not have to examine transportation routes and utility sites before approving the initial sale because ""[u]ntil exploration is proposed and, in all likelihood, until and unless a commercially exploitable discovery is made, there will be no occasion for siting, designing or constructing transportation and utility routes."" Id. We further decided that DNR was not required ""to evaluate the effectiveness of [environmental harm mitigation] measures before even receiving detailed development proposals,"" since DNR would not be able to assess ""detailed mitigation measures even before knowing which activities it needs to mitigate."" Id. at 1347.
In Kuitsarak Corp. v. Swope, 870 P.2d 387 (Alaska 1994), DNR approved offshore prospecting permits in a region without conducting an in-depth analysis of the effects of mining in the region. Id. at 391 n. 13, 394 & n. 21. DNR contended that it lacked sufficient information to conduct such an analysis and that it would be easier to do the analysis when specific mining activities were performed. Id. at 391 n. 13, 394 n. 21. We rejected this procedure. We found that DNR had not adequately considered the potential and cumulative impacts of mining in the region. Id. at 395-96.
We noted that DNR's argument that it was difficult to obtain the information necessary to perform a proper evaluation of the impacts of mining in the region was undermined by evidence of federal studies similar to the studies which DNR needed to do. Id. at 396. We stated that ""[o]nce the initial impact of mining on the region has been assessed, any unforeseen occurrences or conditions that are revealed during exploration can be dealt with by DNR through use of stipulations and conditions imposed on mining."" Id. (emphasis added). We disapproved of DNR's use of conditions to require the development of plans to minimize potential dangers as a substitute for a complete analysis of the potential dangers. See id. at 396 n. 27."
"Second, phasing is prohibited if it can result in disregard of the cumulative potential environmental impacts of a project. See Kuitsarak, 870 P.2d at 396 n. 30; Camden Bay II, 851 P.2d at 1344, 1346; Gorsuch, 835 P.2d at 1246. The more interlinked the components of a project are and the greater the danger that phasing will lead to insufficient consideration of cumulative impacts, the greater the need to bar phasing. Compare Gorsuch, 835 P.2d at 1245-46 (separate permitting permissible so long as DNR determines that cumulative impacts will not be problematic) with Gorsuch, 835 P.2d at 1250-51 (Rabinowitz, J., dissenting) (unified permitting process necessary to ensure adequate consideration of cumulative effects).
Third, conditions and stipulations may be used to address unforeseen occurrences or unforeseen situations that may arise during exploration or development, but permit conditions may not serve as a substitute for an initial pre-permitting analysis that can be conducted with reasonably obtainable information. See Kuitsarak, 870 P.2d at 395-96 & n. 27 (approving possible use of conditions to deal with unforeseen events but disapproving use of conditions as substitute for feasible, complete analysis).
Thus, phasing through the use of conditions is prohibited where it is feasible to obtain the information necessary to determine whether environmental standards will be satisfied before granting an initial permit, but allowed where it is impractical or impossible to create detailed development plans without conducting additional physical exploration. See Camden Bay II, 851 P.2d at 1343-47 (geophysical hazards and historic sites can be investigated during initial permitting stage but transportation routes and mitigation measures cannot be analyzed without further exploration and planning)."
"After the Commission granted Echo Bay the large mine permit for the project as a whole, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) disapproved the pro posal for the dam at Sheep Creek, and Echo Bay abandoned the plan to build the dam there. The EPA's action will undoubtedly force major redesigns in the mine project. This sequence of events illustrates the dangers of CBJ's improper use of phasing — the initial approval for most components of the AJ Mine may cause CBJ to fail to take into account the cumulative impacts of the redesigns made necessary by the change in the location of the tailings dam.
For these reasons we conclude that the Commission erred in granting permit approval of the project while deferring consideration of important portions of the project.
B. Did the Commission Err by Granting the Permit, Yet Imposing as a Condition that Echo Bay Provide Further Information?
As noted, the Commission found that it could ""not conclusively determine at this time with current information that the proposed treatment system will maintain water quality in accordance with federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations."" In addition, the Commission found that ""[t]he available data shows that the federal limit for total suspended solids (TSS) will not be met by the marine water discharge."" In addition to withholding approval of a portion of the project, the second way the Commission responded to this problem was to place conditions into the permit requiring the project ""to comply with federal and state water quality standards."" The Commission should not have granted the AJ mine permit without knowing whether the plan that was submitted to it would satisfy water quality standards.."
"This interpretation of the code is further supported by Kuitsarak, 870 P.2d at 394-96. In Kuitsarak, DNR did not gather necessary information regarding environmental impacts before granting an offshore prospecting permit. Id. Similarly, in this case, further information on water quality was necessary before the Commission could grant the min- tog permit, or even consider the application complete.
CONCLUSION
The Juneau Planning Commission engaged in impermissible phasing in its approval of the AJ Mine permit. The Commission deferred approval of components of the mine which are interlinked with other components, creating an unacceptable danger that cumulative impacts would not be sufficiently analyzed. The Commission utilized conditions as a substitute for evaluations that could have been conducted with feasibly obtainable information.
The Commission reacted by placing conditions on the permits and deferring approval of mine components when it was faced with data that the proposed mine projects would not comply with Juneau code requirements or when it did not have sufficient information to determine whether the requirements would be met. If allowed to use such phasing in response to defects in mining applications, the Commission could grant approval to any permit application no matter how deficient it is, making the Juneau code virtually meaningless and Commission decisions effectively unreviewable.
For these reasons, we REVERSE the decision of the superior court and REMAND this case to the court with directions to vacate the decisions of the Juneau Assembly and of the Commission granting the mine permits, and to REMAND to the Commission for further proceedings to accordance with this opinion."
"OPINION
BRYNER, Chief Judge.
Magistrate Paul K. Verhagen tried Stephen J. Stewart and found him guilty of DWI, AS 28.35.030. Stewart appeals, alleging that the court committed error in denying his motion to dismiss and in sentencing him as a second DWI offender. We affirm the court's denial of the motion to dismiss but remand for further proceedings on the sentencing issue.
On July 23, 1987, while transporting a prisoner north on the Parks Highway, Alaska State Trooper Ellis noticed a car parked on the side of the highway near mile 262 in an area that was not a normal vehicle turnout. The driver, Stewart, appeared to be slumped over his seat. About-an hour later, on his return trip, Ellis spotted Stewart's car on the side of the highway at mile 283. Its engine was running, its headlights were on, and Stewart again appeared to be slumped over in his seat."
"Stewart moved to dismiss the DWI charge on two grounds. First, he contended that his right to privacy was violated when the door to his car was opened by the trooper. Stewart also argued that the trooper lacked probable cause to make a warrantless stop and search of the car. The court denied the motion. Stewart renews these arguments on appeal.
Stewart's arguments assume that Trooper Ellis' actions amounted to a warrantless search. In our view, however, the limited intrusiveness of the trooper's conduct warrants treating the case under the law dealing with investigative stops. In Coleman v. State, 553 P.2d 40 (Alaska 1976), the Alaska Supreme Court held that an investigative stop is permissible where ""the police officer has a reasonable suspicion that imminent public danger exists or serious harm to persons or property has recently occurred."" Id. at 46. Relying on Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), the court noted that the central inquiry is ""the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen's personal security."" Coleman, 553 P.2d at 44. According to the court, the governmental interest justifying the official intrusion must be balanced against the invasion of the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen. The court concluded:
[T]he police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the intrusion_ And in making that assessment it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search ""warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief"" that the action taken was appropriate?"
"The test enunciated in Coleman was met in the present case. Trooper Ellis believed that Stewart might be drunk, sleeping, or having a medical problem. Stewart was slumped over the wheel of his car, apparently unconscious. The car was running. An hour earlier, Ellis had seen Stewart slumped over the wheel of his car approximately twenty-one miles further away. Ellis obviously had a legitimate interest in determining whether Stewart required assistance. Because Stewart's car was running, Ellis also had an immediate interest in ensuring that Stewart's presence behind the wheel did not pose a public danger. The interference with Stewart's right to privacy was minimal when weighed against such important societal interests. The fact that Ellis could have conceivably attempted to accomplish his purpose less intrusively by first knocking on Stewart's window is not determinative. Ellis had a reasonable suspicion that Stewart either posed an imminent risk of driving while intoxicated or needed immediate medical attention. The trooper was thus justified in opening the car door for the limited purpose of making contact with Stewart.
Moreover, even assuming that Ellis' action constituted a warrantless search and seizure, the minimal intrusion in this case would be independently justified under the emergency exception to the warrant requirement. Anchorage v. Cook, 598 P.2d 939, 942 (Alaska 1979). We conclude that there was no violation of the fourth amendment in the present case.
Stewart also contends that the court erred when it sentenced him as a second DWI offender. He bases his argument solely on the fact that, at the sentencing hearing, the only evidence of a prior conviction offered by the state was a computer printout of his driving record. The printout indicated that Stewart was convicted of DWI on October 3, 1984. When Stewart objected to the computer printout, the state requested a continuance to obtain proper documentation. Stewart opposed any continuance, arguing that he had a right to be sentenced without further delay and that, in the absence of proper evidence establishing a prior DWI conviction, the court was required to treat him as a first offender."
"On appeal, Stewart argues that the trial court erred in relying on the computer printout to establish his prior conviction. Stewart further maintains that, because the state was not prepared with documentary evidence establishing a prior conviction, he was entitled to be treated as a first DWI offender.
We agree that the trial court erred in relying on the computer printout to sentence Stewart as a second DWI offender. We believe the issue to be governed by AS 12.55.145(b), which states:
When sentence is imposed under this chapter [Chapter 55, Title 12], prior convictions not expressly admitted by the defendant must be proved by authenticated copies of court records served on the defendant or on the defendant's counsel at least twenty days before the date set for imposition of sentence.
Although the mandatory minimum sentences for DWI are set out in AS 28.35.-030(c), the offense has expressly been made a class A misdemeanor. See AS 28.-35.030(b). DWI offenders are therefore subject to the general sentencing provisions of AS 12.55.135. Since DWI sentences are subject to the general sentencing provisions of AS 12.55.135, they qualify as sentences imposed ""under this chapter"" for purposes of AS 12.55.145(b). Alaska Statute 12.55.145(b) clearly contemplates that the prosecution must ordinarily bear the burden of proving prior convictions by recourse to authenticated copies of court records. Given the provisions of AS 12.55.-145(b), the trial court erred in relying on a computer printout of Stewart's prior record and in placing upon Stewart the burden of establishing that he had not previously been convicted."
"OPINION
EASTAUGH, Justice.
I. INTRODUCTION
This case concerns the effect of a personal injury release executed by Rodney Ahwinona in 1991. The superior court granted a Civil Rule 12(b)(6) motion dismissing a 1994 lawsuit Ahwinona brought against two of the releasees. We affirm."
"Rodney Ahwinona suffered a broken leg while he was in custody of the State of Alaska, Department of Corrections (DOC), and riding on a snowmachine driven by Clarence Jackson, a DOC employee. Through his attorney, Ahwinona sued Jackson, the State, and the Maniilaq Association for personal injury damages arising out of the accident. At the time of the accident, Ahwinona was incarcerated at a rehabilitation camp run by Maniilaq. The accident occurred while Ahwinona was being transported to Kotzebue to obtain supplies. The complaint was filed November 2, 1990, in the superior court in Nome.
On May 21, 1991, Ahwinona signed a document entitled ""Release of All Claims."" It recited that for consideration of $6,000, re ceipt of which was acknowledged, Ahwinona ""hereby releases and forever discharges Clarence Jackson, the Maniilaq Association, and the State of Alaska."" Ahwinona's signature was affixed before a notary public. His attorney signed an attached ""Attorney's Representation"" dated May 28 stating that she had explained and discussed the nature and purpose of the release with Ahwinona and that to the best of her knowledge, ""my client understands the nature and effect of this document and assents to its terms."" On May 15, prior to signing the release, Ahwinona executed a document entitled ""Special Power of Attorney,"" which permitted his attorney ""as my attorney-in-fact"" to endorse and cash ""the settlement check in the amount of $6,000.00"" and sign release documents in the case ""against the State of Alaska, Clarence Jackson, and Maniilaq Association."" That power was also executed before a notary. On June 24 Ahwinona's attorney sent to Ah-winona a letter which enclosed his ""full and final settlement check in the amount of $4,000.00 and a copy of your Settlement Sheet."" The settlement sheet, countersigned by Ahwinona on June 18, acknowledged that the ""full settlement amount"" was $6,000 and that $4,000 was the ""total due client"" after deduction of attorney's fees. The attorney's trust account check to Ahwinona in the amount of $4,000 bore the notation ""Full & Final Settlement."""
"The State and Jackson filed an answer to Ahwinona's complaint, raising the 1991 settlement and release as a defense. The State then moved to dismiss pursuant to Civil Rule 12(b)(6), asserting that the claims were barred by the prior settlement. In support, the motion to dismiss relied upon Ahwinona's 1994 complaint and the documents which Ah-winona attached to that complaint, including the 1991 release and attorney's representation.
Ahwinona opposed the motion in an un-sworn memorandum which asserted that the release he signed released only Maniilaq Association. He asserted that when he agreed to settle, he expected settlement from all three defendants, including the State and Jackson, but learned ""while in the process of signing [the] release for Maniilaq Association"" that the State was not going to pay for the settlement. He also asserted that the State's lawyers did not send him release papers to sign to release the State and Jackson ""formally."" He further asserted that Jackson and the State were responsible for his injury, and that they had agreed to settle but then ""turned around"" and said that they were not going to pay for the settlement. The trial court granted the State's motion to dismiss and dismissed Ahwinona's claims with prejudice.
Ahwinona sought reconsideration, and elaborated on his theory that the State and the Department of Law had agreed to settle but ""went back on their word"" when they failed to pay the settlement and provide a release of liability for him to execute. It appears to have been Ahwinona's theory that the State could not settle the claims against itself and Jackson unless the State itself paid the settlement proceeds to Ahwinona and provided him with a release document authored by the Attorney General's Office. It was also apparently his theory that the check and the release did not discharge the State's responsibility to settle the claims against the State and Jackson. The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration."
"The trial court entered final judgment against Ahwinona. Ahwinona appeals.
III. DISCUSSION
It is uncertain what documents the trial court considered apart from the complaint. Normally, if the trial court in deciding a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss relies on ""matters outside the pleadings,"" the motion is to be treated as one for summary judgment, and resolved in accordance with Rule 56. Alaska R. Civ. P. 12(c). Maynard v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 902 P.2d 1328, 1329 (Alaska 1995); Shotting v. Dillingham City Sch. Dist., 617 P.2d 9, 11 n. 4 (Alaska 1980). In Brice v. State, 669 P.2d 1311, 1314 (Alaska 1983), we summarized the three alternatives available to a reviewing court when it is unclear whether the trial court relied on matters outside the pleadings. We stated:
The reviewing court may either (1) reverse the decision and remand for proper consideration as either a Rule 12(b)(6) motion or a Rule 56 summary judgment motion; (2) review the decision as if it were á Rule 12(b)(6) decision, with accompanying exclusion of the materials external to the pleadings; or (3) review the decision as if it were the grant of summary judgment after conversion of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to one for summary judgment.
Id. (citing Martin v. Mears, 602 P.2d 421, 427 (Alaska 1979)).
In this case the documents evidencing the prior settlement and terms of the release were attached to Ahwinona's 1994 complaint. Under these circumstances, the trial court could properly rely upon these materials in deciding the State's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) without converting it into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56. Industrial Constructors Corp. v. Bureau of Reclamation, 15 F.3d 963, 964-65 (10th Cir.1994); Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 453 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 114 S.Ct. 2704, 129 L.Ed.2d 832 (1994); Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1112 (10th Cir.1991); Hal Roach Studios v. Richard Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 n. 19 (9th Cir. 1990); Chester County Intermediate Unit v. Pennsylvania Blue Shield, 896 F.2d 808, 812 (3d Cir.1990); Morton v. Becker, 793 F.2d 185, 187 (8th Cir.1986); Sullivan v. United States, 788 F.2d 813, 815 n. 3 (1st Cir.1986); Quiller v. Barclays Am./Credit, Inc., 727 F.2d 1067, 1069 (11th Cir.1984), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1124, 106 S.Ct. 1992, 1993, 90 L.Ed.2d 673 (1986); 2A James W. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice ¶ 12.09[3] n. 6, at 12-107 (2d ed.1995); 5A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1357, at 299 (2d ed.1990). Therefore, under alternative two outlined in Brice, we can review the superior court decision as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion with reference to the documents attached by Ahwinona to his complaint."
"Because we have the discretion to review the superior court's decision as if that court converted the State's motion to a summary judgment motion, Brice, 669 P.2d at 1314 (citing Douglas v. Glacier State Telephone Co., 615 P.2d 580, 591-92 (Alaska 1980)), we alternately review and affirm the superior court decision under that standard.
After the court granted the motion to dismiss, denied Ahwinona's motion for reconsideration, and was considering entry of final judgment, Ahwinona asserted that he understood he would be paid $6,000 by each defendant. This was the first time he expressly made this factual assertion. Ahwinona did not make this assertion in any sworn documents. Nonetheless, disregarding the fact that this unsworn assertion was not timely raised and did not qualify as evidence creating a genuine fact dispute, Ahwinona's misunderstanding of the terms of the release raised no material factual issue.
In Witt v. Watkins, 579 P.2d 1065 (Alaska 1978), we articulated the test for setting aside a release:
Once the party relying on a release establishes that it was given with an understanding of the nature of the instrument, the burden is on the releasor to show by clear and convincing evidence that the release should be set aside. Factors that may be considered are the manner in which the release was obtained including whether it was hastily secured at the instigation of the releasee; whether the relea-sor was at a disadvantage because of the nature of his injuries; whether the relea-sor was represented by counsel; whether he relied on representations of the releasee or a physician retained by the releasee and whether liability was seriously in dispute. The relative bargaining positions of the parties and the amount to be paid should also be considered."
"Ahwinona presents no persuasive argument that his signing of the release was coereed, the result of disadvantaged bargaining ability due to his injury or otherwise, or founded on representations made to him by the State or Jackson or their agents. Rather, Ahwinona's claim is based on his misunderstanding of the settlement agreement. Ahwinona states ""[wjhen I agreed with the defendants to settle out of court, I was expecting settlement of six thousand dollars from each of the defendants."" In support of this expectation, Ahwinona argues that ""[t]he release of liability signed by me states that each side bear their own cost and attorney's fees. That means specifically that . the state has its own cost for personal injury; . [and] Clarence Jackson has his own cost for personal injury.""
When he settled in 1991 Ahwinona was represented by counsel who attested to the fact that she explained the release and that Ahwinona understood ""the nature and effect of [the release] and assent[ed] to its terms."" Absent any showing of coercion or fraud, Ahwinona's mistaken understanding of the release is not sufficient to set it aside. See Mitchell v. Mitchell, 655 P.2d 748, 753 (Alaska 1982) (refusing to set aside a settlement, stating that the releasor's mistake was ""legally irrelevant because the [settlement] clearly and unambiguously dismisses the entire lawsuit.""). Despite Ahwinona's misinterpretation, the release clearly discharges all claims against the State and Jackson arising out of the snowmobile incident. Even if we assume Ahwinona was seeking reformation of the release to reflect his alleged understanding of the release terms, Ahwinona fails to raise material fact issues sufficient to succeed on such a claim. Therefore, Ahwinona did not raise any genuine issues of material fact sufficient to avoid the clear terms of the release and the effect of the prior settlement."
"Given the record before it, the superior court could not permissibly have denied judg ment to the State of Alaska and Clarence Jackson. It consequently did not err in dismissing Ahwinona's complaint. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the trial court's entry of final judgment against Ahwinona.
. See also Murat v. F/V Shelikof Strait, 793 P.2d 69, 75 (Alaska 1990) (stating that unauthenticated documents can be considered in support of a motion when no timely objection to the documents is made, relying on ""the well-recognized principle that a failure to timely raise any eviden-tiary objection constitutes waiver of that objection and permits the court to consider the proffered evidence"") (citing Kvasnikoff v. Weaver Bros., Inc., 405 P.2d 781, 784 (Alaska 1965) (holding that unauthenticated documents may be considered in support of a motion for summary judgment where the documents were not objected to or their authenticity disputed)).
. In Brock v. Rogers & Babler, Inc., 536 P.2d 778, 782 (Alaska 1975), we held that the respondent in a summary judgment motion ""must set forth specific facts showing that he could produce admissible evidence reasonably tending to dispute the movant's evidence. Assertions of fact in pleadings and memoranda are not admissible evidence and cannot be relied upon for the purposes of summary judgment."" (Citations omitted.)
. Ahwinona's mistaken belief that he would receive $6,000 from each defendant is not a sufficient basis for reformation of the release. ""Reformation of an instrument is the proper remedy where it is alleged that the instrument does not conform to the actual intentions of the parties."" D.M. v. D.A., 885 P.2d 94, 96 (Alaska 1994) (citing Oaksmith v. Brusich, 774 P.2d 191, 197 (Alaska 1989))."
"OPINION
COMPTON, Chief Justice.
I. INTRODUCTION
Pier Hale appeals the superior court's af-firmance of a Workers' Compensation Board decision denying her claim for certain medical expenses. The Board held that the Anchorage School District was not required to pay Hale's physical therapist for treatments in excess of the Board's standard treatment frequency because the physical therapist failed to submit a conforming treatment plan within the statutory period. The Board also held that the School District was required to pay Hale's chiropractor for ten treatments. We affirm the former holding and reverse the latter.
II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
The following facts are taken from Anchorage Sch. Dist. v. Hale, 857 P.2d 1186 (Alaska 1993) (Hale I), the first appeal of this case:
On September 26, 1988, Pier Hale suffered injuries to her back and right shoulder while working as a teachers' assistant for the Anchorage School District. She received medical attention for these injuries at the Providence Hospital Emergency Room on October 2nd. Three days later her doctor recommended that she undergo daily therapy for these injuries for two weeks. This therapy began on October 7, 1988, at Anchorage Physical Therapists. Since daily therapy would exceed the number of compensable treatments allowed under the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board's (Board) continuing treatment guidelines, 8 Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 45.082(f) (1992), Hale was required to gain Board approval for the excess treatments if she wanted her employer to pay for them. The Board can give such approval only if the employee's doctor furnishes the employer -with a detailed treatment plan within fourteen days after starting the treatments. AS 23.30.095(c)."
"Hale filed an application for adjustment of claim with the Board seeking payment for her treatments in excess of the Board's frequency standards. The Board denied this request, limiting Hale to compensation for the number of treatments allowed under the Board's guidelines. The Board based its decision solely upon Physical Therapists' failure to file a timely, conforming treatment plan.
Hale appealed the Board's decision to the superior court on the ground that the Board's standards and procedures for compensation for continuing similar treatments are invalid. The superior court held that 8 AAC 45.082(f) is invalid, reversed the Board's decision, and remanded the ease to the Board for further consideration. The School District then filed this petition for review.
Id. at 1187-88 (footnotes omitted). In Hale I we held that 8 AAC 45.082(f) was a valid exercise of the Board's rulemaking authority. Id. at 1188-91. We reversed and remanded for further proceedings. Id. at 1191.
On remand, the superior court affirmed the Board on the medical expenses issue, holding that the School District was not required to pay Physical Therapists for treatments in excess of the Board's frequency standards, based on Physical Therapists' failure to file a timely treatment plan. The superior court also affirmed the Board's order requiring the School District to pay for ten chiropractic treatments Hale received from Dr. Kenneth Ketz. Hale appeals.
III. DISCUSSION
A. Standard of Review
When the superior court acts as an intermediate appellate court, we review the merits of the underlying administrative decision, giving no deference to the superior court's determination. Tesoro Alaska Petroleum Co. v. Kenai Pipe Line Co., 746 P.2d 896, 903 (Alaska 1987). We review the Board's denial of Hale's medical expenses claim under the independent judgment test, since whether Physical Therapists failed to file a treatment plan in accordance with AS 23.30.096(e) is a question of law involving no agency expertise. See Handley v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 838 P.2d 1231, 1233 (Alaska 1992). We review the Board's factual finding that Dr. Ketz was entitled to reimbursement for ten chiropractic treatments under the substantial evidence test. Id."
"Hale argues that Physical Therapists complied with AS 23.30.095(c) by submitting a treatment plan within fourteen days after it was determined that Hale would need continuing treatment. Hale misreads AS 23.30.095(c) by assuming that a health care provider's obligation to file a treatment plan turns on the indefinite or continuous nature of the recommended treatment. In fact, the obligation to file a treatment plan is entirely dependent on the frequency, not the duration, of treatments. By its plain language, AS 23.30.095(c) requires a physician or health care provider to submit a conforming treatment plan ""if the course of treatment will require more frequent outpatient visits than the standard treatment frequen-cy_"" AS 23.30.095(c). If the treatments exceed the standard treatment frequency, then a plan must be submitted ""within 14 days after treatment begins."" Id.
The standard treatment frequency for the first month of any treatment is three treatments per week. 8 AAC 45.082(f). On October 7 Hale began receiving daily physical therapy at Physical Therapists. It was therefore incumbent on Physical Therapists to submit a conforming treatment plan by October 21, in order to be paid for treatments in excess of the standard treatment frequency. AS 23.30.095(c). This was the Board's conclusion. We agree.
Hale argues that the Board's reading of AS 23.30.095(c) places an unfair burden on the health care provider by requiring it to anticipate, at the outset, that the prescribed treatment will continue ""for some indefinite period of time."" As the statutory analysis outlined above makes clear, Physical Therapists needed no ""clairvoyance"" to comply with AS 23.30.095(c). Once it began a course of treatment of daily physical therapy, the fourteen-day notification period of AS 23.30.095(c) commenced. Regardless of when Hale's treating physician determined that Hale would need long-term physical therapy, Physical Therapists was required to submit a conforming treatment plan within fourteen days after October 7, the date it began physical therapy in excess of the standard treatment frequency."
"On April 24, 1989, Hale began a course of treatment with Dr. Kenneth Ketz. On April 27 Dr. Ketz filed a treatment plan calling for chiropractic treatments in excess of the standard treatment frequency. The Board found that the plan was timely filed; that it conformed with AS 23.30.095(c); and that the treatments called for in the plan were likely to improve Hale's condition. See 8 AAC 45.082(g). The effect of these findings was to make the School District responsible for all of Dr. Ketz's treatments, including those in excess of the standard treatment frequency. After reviewing the payments the School District had already made to Dr. Ketz, the Board determined that the School District still owed Dr. Ketz for eleven treatments. Later in the same decision, the Board held, without explanation, that Dr. Ketz was entitled to payment for ten treatments.
The Board's initial finding that Dr. Ketz was owed for eleven treatments was correct. The Board's later conclusion that Dr. Ketz was owed for ten treatments is not supported by substantial evidence. We therefore reverse, and direct the Board on remand to enter an order requiring the School District to pay Dr. Ketz for eleven treatments.
IV. CONCLUSION
We AFFIRM the Board's holding that the School District was not required to pay Physical Therapists for treatments in excess of the standard treatment frequency. We REVERSE the Board's holding that the School District must pay Dr. Ketz for ten chiropractic treatments. The case is REMANDED to the Board for an order requiring the School District to pay Dr. Ketz for eleven treatments."
"OPINION
FABE, Justice.
I. INTRODUCTION
This is an appeal from the decision of the superior court upholding the University of Alaska's award of a coal hauling and unloading contract to Royal Contractors. We affirm."
"The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF or the University) generates its own power and produces heat for the campus buildings by means of a coal-burning power plant. For many years the University obtained coal for its power plant through the Alaska Railroad Corporation (ARRC), which delivered the coal in rail cars to a siding next to the power plant. This method of delivery required UAF employees to unload the coal into the hoppers. In 1992 Timothy C. Gun-derson, d/b/a Alaska Contract Motor Express, (Gunderson) submitted an unsolicited proposal to UAF, offering to truck coal to UAF and to deliver the coal directly into the coal hoppers at the UAF power plant.
UAF entered into a sole-source contract with Gunderson in the fall of 1992. Upon learning of this contract, ARRC filed a formal written protest with UAF, asserting that the sole-source contract violated both state and university procurement codes. In response to the protest, UAF appointed a hearing officer who determined that the sole-source contract violated competitive contracting requirements.
UAF responded to the hearing officer's decision by issuing Request For Proposal (RFP) number 93P0085TK. A preproposal conference was held between UAF and interested contractors.
The criteria for evaluation and award of the contract were set forth in the RFP as follows:
Award will be to the low responsive, responsible offeror whose offer conforms in all essential respects to the solicitation requirements, price and other factors specifically set forth herein considered."
"Discussions or negotiations may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. If ""Best and Final"" offers are requested, they will be evaluated against the same criteria as were the initial proposals.
The RFP also requested information describing the offerors' proposed methodology and a checklist of requirements for contractors to be considered responsive and responsible, as well as a detailed pricing schedule and specifications for performance. Following the pre-proposal conference, UAF issued an amendment to the RFP clarifying issues raised at the conference.
There were no objections to the RFP, and none of the contractors, including Gunderson, complained or asserted that UAF had failed to set forth adequate criteria for the evaluation of the proposals and determination of the final award.
In response to the RFP, UAF received nine proposals, including Gunderson's. Royal Contractors (Royal) offered the lowest price at $7.82 per ton of coal delivered and unloaded. Alaska Pacific Transport, Inc. offered the second lowest price, at $8.00 per ton. Haulin Hanna, Inc. proposed a price of $8.12 per ton, while Gunderson was the fourth lowest proposer at $8.18 per ton.
As permitted under the competitive proposal method of contract selection, UAF requested from the qualified offerors further proposal information and clarification, including price confirmation. This request did not reveal the prices offered by other contractors, nor did it disclose any recipient's ranking in relation to the other proposals received. In response, Royal offered a price reduction to $7.57 per ton. UAF determined that Royal was the low responsive and responsible proposer, and a Notice of Intent to Award Contract to Royal was issued."
"Gunderson appealed this administrative decision to the superior court. The superior court upheld the chief procurement officer's determinations and the denial of Gunderson's protest. In reaching this conclusion, the court found that (1) UAF did not violate the state procurement code or its own procurement regulations and procedures by using the RFP procedure to award the coal hauling and unloading contract at issue; (2) UAF's RFP included sufficient evaluation factors to satisfy the requirements of state law and UAF's own regulations; (3) Gunderson had standing to challenge the responsiveness of Royal's proposal as it relates to the question of UAF's implied duty to consider, fairly and honestly, all of the proposals; and (4) Royal's proposal was responsive as it did not contain any variance that would give it a substantial advantage over any of the other contractors.
This appeal followed.
III. DISCUSSION
Gunderson asserts that UAF disregarded the rules and regulations governing the award of public contracts. He raises the following issues on appeal: (1) the RFP issued by UAF did not contain any evaluation factors, in violation of AS 36.30.210(b) and UAF Procurement Regulations and Procedures P-3-064; (2) the proposal of Royal, the successful bidder, was not responsive to the terms and specifications of the RFP; and (3) Royal amended its proposal after the due date in violation of AS 36.30.240 and UAF Procurement Regulations and Procedures P-3-081 by further reducing its price.
A. Standard of Review"
"When an appeal of an agency decision involves a question of statutory interpretation, this court applies one of two standards. ""The 'rational basis' test is used when the issue involves agency expertise or the determination of fundamental policies within the agency's statutory function."" Public Employees' Local 71 v. State, 775 P.2d 1062, 1063 (Alaska 1989). This standard is generally applied in two circumstances:
First, . where the agency is making law by creating standards to be used in evaluating the case before it and future cases. Second, . when a case requires resolution of policy questions which lie within the agency's area of expertise and are inseparable from the facts underlying the agency's decision.
Tesoro Alaska Petroleum Co. v. Kenai Pipe Line Co., 746 P.2d 896, 903 (Alaska 1987) (quoting Earth Resources Co. v. State, Dep't of Revenue, 665 P.2d 960, 964 (Alaska 1983)). However, when the statutory interpretation does not involve agency expertise, or the agency's specialized knowledge and experience would not be particularly probative, this court independently reviews the decision and substitutes its own judgment. Public Employees'Local 71, 775 P.2d at 1063.
The superior court found that the applicability of UAF's procurement regulations and procedures to the award of a coal hauling and unloading contract was a question of statutory interpretation not involving agency expertise, since the regulations and procedures were developed in accordance with the requirements of the State Procurement Code in AS 36.30.005 — .995. The superior court then substituted its judgment in the resolution of the issues presented."
"We conclude that the appropriate standard for reviewing the decision of the University's chief procurement officer is the reasonable basis standard rather than the substitution of judgment standard employed by the superior court. Under this standard, we seek to ""determine whether the agency's decision is supported by the facts and has a reasonable basis in law, even if we may not agree with the agency's ultimate determination."" Teso-ro Alaska Petroleum, 746 P.2d at 903.
B. The Request for Proposals
Gunderson claims that UAF violated the Alaska procurement code and its own regulations by failing to disclose relevant evaluation criteria in the RFP as required by state law and UAF procurement regulations. Specifically, Gunderson claims that the RFP failed to list the factors that were going to be considered by the procurement officer in evaluating the proposals and omitted information about the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors.
AS 36.30.200, which sets forth the competitive sealed proposal method for awarding an ""agency contract,"" does not apply to the Uni versity because AS 36.30.990(1) specifically exempts the University from the definition of ""agency"" under the state procurement code. Furthermore, under AS 36.30.005(c), ""all rights, powers, duties and authority relating to the procurement of supplies, services, professional services, and construction"" are delegated to the University's Board of Regents. However, this provision also states that ""[t]o the maximum extent possible, authority granted under this subsection shall be exercised in accordance with this chapter."" Additionally, the Board of Regents is directed to ""adopt regulations . that are substantially equivalent to the regulations adopted by the commissioner of administration."" AS 36.30.005(c)."
"RFP No. 93P0035TK provides in part:
The University of Alaska Fairbanks is soliciting offers for the hauling and off loading of coal for the UAF Power Plant. Transportation services are to be provided from mine mouth, Healy, Alaska to the UAF Power Plant. Coal shall be off loaded into the coal receiving facility located below the railroad tracks at the UAF Power Plant facility. The successful offeror shall provide all labor, equipment and supplies necessary to execute the terms and conditions contained in this RFP.
The University requires from 110 to 220 tons of coal per day depending on load and weather conditions. Hauling and off loading services shall be performed in support of continuous operation of the Power Plant. The contract shall commence upon award and shall continue until June 30,1994, with one (1) year renewal options for up to seven (7) additional years, ending not later than June 30,2001.
We hold that the foregoing satisfies the requirement of a ""purchase description"" for purposes of P-3-064(2) as well as explicitly describing the ""delivery or performance schedule."" The RFP also contains evaluation criteria, including price, responsiveness and responsibility:
Subject to provisions of section 11, Instructions to Offerors, and the terms and conditions contained herein, an award will be to a single offeror. Award will be to the low responsive, responsible offeror whose offer conforms in all essential respects to the solicitation requirements, price and other factors specifically set forth herein considered."
"Discussions or negotiations may be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. If ""Best and Final"" offers are requested, they will be evaluated against the same criteria as were the initial proposals.
Even if the evaluation criteria listed in the RFP were deficient in some unexplained respect, Gunderson has ""failed to demonstrate that such error prejudiced [his] proposal in comparison to others, since each proposal received identical treatment."" King v. Alaska State Hous. Auth., 512 P.2d 887, 894 (Alaska 1973) (holding agency's failure to assign specific grade to earthquake risk did not deprive evaluation of proposals of reasonable basis); see also Fairbanks N. Star Borough Sch. Dist. v. Bowers Office Prods., Inc., 851 P.2d 56, 59 n. 3 (Alaska 1993) (finding consideration of factors only implicitly included in RFP justified).
A review of the record confirms the University's assertion that the RFP contained the evaluation factors required by P-3-064. We therefore affirm the superior court's decision holding that UAF's RFP included sufficient evaluation factors to satisfy the requirements of state law and UAF's own regulations.
C. Royal's Proposal
1. Responsiveness to Terms and Specifications
Gunderson contends that Royal's proposal was not responsive to the terms and specifications of the RFP. Gunderson complains that Royal's successful bid proposed the use of ""end-dump containers"" while the RFP in Specification No. 2, Scope of Services stated:
The coal must be delivered in bottom dump containers to enable dumping through a grill . and into a grizzly located below the railroad tracks. Services shall be performed in strict accordance with these specifications, and all terms and conditions of the contract."
"UAF concedes that the type of truck proposed by Royal, a self-unloading trailer that emptied through the rear by means of a conveyor belt, was not the type of trailer initially contemplated by the University. However, UAF points out that ""the reason for the bottom-dump trailer specification was that clearance in the University's facility did not allow raising a conventional end-dump trailer for unloading purposes.""
It is well settled that a public entity ""is required to reject bids which vary materially from the specifications set forth in the published request for proposal."" McBirney & Assocs. v. State, 753 P.2d 1132, 1136 (Alaska 1988). We have previously held that ""[a] variance is considered material if it gives one bidder 'a substantial advantage over other bidders and thereby restricts or stifles competition.' "" Id. (quoting Chris Berg, Inc., 680 P.2d. at 94).
In this case, the purpose of the bottom-dump specification in the RFP was to allow adequate clearance for dumping at UAF's facility. In denying Gunderson's protest, the chief procurement officer concluded that the proposal by Royal contained only a ""minor variation on the theme established by the RFP — that is that coal may be delivered to the UAF Power Plant by means other than rail car."" He based this conclusion on his finding that ""the size and capacity of the grizzly located in the coal handling facility does not restrict end dumping as proposed by Royal.... For purposes of this RFP they have proposed a method of delivery and off loading that appears viable and they will be held to the requirements for performance."""
"2. Reduction of Proposed Price
After evaluating the proposals received, UAF sent a form letter to those offerors ""within the competitive range for further consideration."" This June 24, 1993 letter requested a confirmation of the price schedule from the original proposal and further informed these offerors that
[a]s soon as the evaluation is completed you will be advised of the results. In addition, you are notified that additional clarification or information and a best and final offer may be requested at a later date.
(Emphasis added.)
Upon receipt of this letter, Royal amended its proposal by further reducing the price on its price schedule, without awaiting a request by UAF for a best and final offer. Gunder-son argues that the University did not provide any of the other offerors an opportunity to make a best and final offer at a later date. Gunderson also contends that Royal's price reduction violated University PR & P 3-081.
As UAF points out, changes in price after the proposal deadline are expressly permitted under the University's competitive sealed proposals procedure. P-3-061(a) provides:
The competitive sealed proposals method differs from competitive sealed bidding in two important ways. First, it permits discussions with competing offerors and changes in their proposals including price; and second, it allows comparative subjective evaluations to be made when determining acceptable proposals for negotiation and award of the contract.
The ability of offerors to make price adjustments is further recognized under P-3-061(b): ""Under competitive sealed proposals, revisions in a proposal, including prices, may be made after proposals are opened."" Furthermore, Royal's submission was not an untimely modification to the RFP but instead was a response to a letter requesting verification of its proposal."
"The chief procurement officer found that the University did not accept a ""late modification"" but had merely allowed a change in price expressly permitted by P-3-061(b). The chief procurement officer's decision did not constitute an abuse of discretion, and the decision has a reasonable basis in the law.
IV. CONCLUSION
""The determination by a public agency of the responsiveness of a bid is within the agency's discretion, subject, on judicial review, to an ascertainment that there was a reasonable basis for the agency's action."" Chris Berg, Inc., 680 P.2d at 94. In this ease, the chief procurement officer did not abuse his discretion in awarding the coal hauling contract to Royal. We hold that there is a reasonable basis for the award to Royal and AFFIRM the decision of the superior court upholding the award of the contract to Royal.
. Gunderson filed suit in response to the hearing officer's finding. The superior court dismissed Gunderson's claims against ARRC, ruling that ARRC was immune from suit under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. This court concluded that the superior court properly granted summary judgment in favor of ARRC. Gunderson v. University of Alaska, Fairbanks, 902 P.2d 323 (Alaska 1995).
. Alaska Pacific Transport, Inc. and Gunderson did not change their prices in response to the request for clarification and price confirmation; however, Haulin Hanna, Inc. increased its price to $13.82 per ton, changing Gunderson's ranking to the third most favorable proposal.
. The contract was formally awarded to Royal on September 23, 1993."
"A request for proposals must contain that information necessary for an offeror to submit a proposal or contain references to any information that cannot reasonably be included with the request. The request must provide a description of the factors that will be considered by the procurement officer when evaluating the proposals received, including the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors.
. AS 36.30.990(1) states that "" 'agency' . does not include (i) the University of Alaska.""
. Gunderson also acquiesced to the RFP process and did not object until after he learned that the contract would go to another bidder. The University's RFP clearly stated in Section 7(a):
Offerors must read the RFP thoroughly. Any ambiguity, conflict, discrepancy, omission or other errors in this RFP should be reported in writing to the University of Alaska address for inquiries shdwn on the face of the RFP prior to the Pre-proposal Conference and in any case must be reported prior to the proposal submit-tal deadline.
Therefore, UAF has a strong argument that Gun-derson has waived his objections.
This argument finds support in the federal government contract bidding process. Protests against the language and specifications of an Invitation for Bids (IFB) must be received by the Comptroller General (Comp.Gen.) prior to bid opening.
The Comp. Gen. will not consider a protest against an alleged deficiency in the IFB if the protester goes along with the procurement without objection until it appears that the award may go to another bidder. If the bidder has not protested before then, he is deemed to have acquiesced in the terms of the IFB."
". P-3-081 states:-
Unless otherwise provided in the request for proposals, any proposal, withdrawal, or modification received after the established due date at the place and closing time designated for receipt of proposals is late and may only be considered if its lateness is due solely to mishandling by the university.
. In response to the University's request for clarification, Gunderson indicated that he was proposing to use his own new type of specially designed equipment; two other bidders adjusted their prices.
.In its decision the superior court addressed the issue of whether Gunderson had standing to protest the responsiveness of Royal's proposal. The court determined that Gunderson had a sufficient personal stake in the outcome to have standing to protest the responsiveness of Royal's proposal. In holding that Gunderson had standing, the superior court stated:
Acknowledging the Alaska Supreme Court's stated liberal construction of standing in administrative appeals, and the fact that the responsiveness issue is only part of Gunderson's argument, this court finds that Gunderson has standing to challenge the responsiveness of Royal's proposal as it relates to the question of UAF's implied duty to fairly and honestly consider all of the proposals.
UAF renews its argument before this court that Gunderson lacks standing to protest the responsiveness of Royal's proposal. It argues that Gun-derson does not have a sufficient personal stake in the outcome of the controversy since he did not present the second lowest price proposal. Although a judgment of the superior court may be affirmed on different grounds than those advanced by the trial court, we need not reach the issue of standing given our conclusion that the chief procurement officer did not abuse his discretion in the contract award."
"BRYNER, Chief Judge.
Codefendants Clint D. and Connie J. Knix appeal their convictions of perjury, AS 11.56.200(a), engaging in a scheme to defraud, AS 11.46.600(a)(2), and second-degree theft, AS 11.46.180(a) and AS 11.16.110(2)(B), raising various constitutional claims and statutory construction questions. We affirm the perjury and scheme to defraud convictions but hold that the theft convictions merge with the convictions for scheme to defraud.
Clint and Connie Knix applied for and received public assistance from the State of Alaska, Division of Public Assistance (DPA), from October 1991 through October 1992. From October 1991 through April 1992, the Knixes declared no income. Early in 1992, DPA received an allegation of welfare fraud, which indicated that the Knixes were earning income through a business venture called ""Scrumptious Sourdough."" On May 21,1992, DPA employee Guy Swafford interviewed the Knixes concerning their business. During the interview, Clint Knix acknowledged that the Knixes had previously done business under the name Scrumptious Sourdough, but he told Swafford that the business had made no sales and had earned no income since September of 1991.
At Swafford's request, Clint Knix wrote out a statement declaring that the Knixes had received no income from their business venture from September 1991 through May 1992. Beneath this declaration, Swafford wrote, ""UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY, THIS IS A TRUE AND ACCURATE STATEMENT."" Both Knixes signed and dated the statement. Swafford, a notary public, then added his own signature and affixed his notary seal."
"On appeal, the Knixes first argue that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support their convictions for perjury. The Knix-es specifically argue that the state failed to prove that their May 21, 1992, statement to Swafford qualified as a ""sworn statement"" for the purposes of the perjury statute.
Under AS 11.56.200(a), ""[a] person commits the crime of perjury if the person makes a false sworn statement which the person does not believe to be true."" Alaska Statutes 11.56.240(2) defines two forms of ""sworn statement."" For present purposes, we need consider only the form of sworn statement defined in subparagraph (2) (A) of the statute: ""a statement knowingly given under oath or affirmation attesting to the truth of what is stated, including a notarized statement[.]""
By its own terms, subparagraph (2)(A) requires this form of sworn statement to be given under oath or affirmation. Under AS 09.63.010, oaths or affirmations may be taken by justices, judges, and magistrates, by clerks of court or their deputies, or by notaries, postmasters, and commissioned officers and municipal clerks in certain circumstances. Under AS 09.63.030(a), any officer authorized to administer an oath may notarize a document by certifying ""on the document that it was signed and sworn to or affirmed before the officer.""
The Knixes point out that DPA employee Guy Swafford testified at trial that he never actually administered an oath or affirmation to the Knixes; and although Swafford affixed his notary seal and signature to the Knixes' statement, he did not certify on the statement ""that it was signed and sworn to or affirmed before [him],"" as required under AS 09.63.030(a). Given Swafford's failure to administer an oath or affirmation and his failure to include a proper certification, the Knixes insist that their signed statement to Swafford cannot properly be considered a sworn statement as defined in AS 11.56.240(2)(A)."
"The Knixes nevertheless say that Gargan is distinguishable. They point out that, unlike Gargan, the signed statement in this case does not certify on its face that the Knixes were under oath and does not otherwise ""purport[] to be sworn."" Id. at 1005. For these reasons, according to the Knixes, their statement to Swafford cannot be construed as ""a verification on its face of the truthfulness of the facts contained therein."" Id.
We disagree. As we have previously pointed out, a sworn statement can be made under either ""oath or affirmation attesting to the truth of what is stated[J"" AS 11.56.240(2)(A). Although the Knixes' statement does not on its face purport to have been given under oath, it clearly does purport to have been given under affirmation. ""An 'affirmation' is a statement by which a person signifies that he is bound in conscience to act truthfully. No particular form of oath or affirmation is required by Alaska law[.]"" Anchorage Sand and Gravel Co., 619 P.2d at 1016. On its face, the written statement given to Swafford by the Knixes de- elared that, ""under penalty of perjury, this is a true and accurate statement."" By virtue of this language, the Knixes plainly ""signifie[d] that [they were] bound in conscience to act truthfully."" Id. This readily qualifies as an affirmation, and its presence on the face of the notarized statement renders the statement one that ""purports to be sworn."" Gargan, 805 P.2d at 1005.
Although Swafford did not expressly ""certify on the [face of the statement] that it was signed and sworn to or affirmed before [him,]"" AS 09.63.030(a), the inference that it was so affirmed flows logically from the presence of the affirmation itself, coupled with Swafford's signature seal of office. Alaska's perjury statute specifically provides that ""it is not a defense [to a charge of perjury] that . the oath or affirmation was taken or administered in an irregular manner."" AS 11.56.200(b)(2). To the extent that Swaf-ford's certification failed to comply with the formal statutory requirements governing certification of notarized documents, the deficiency falls squarely within the realm of this provision."
"Errors or omissions in the jurat ordinarily will not render void an otherwise valid affidavit. See, e.g., American Home Life Ins. Co. v. Heide, 199 Kan. 652, 433 P.2d 454, 458 (1967) (""If a declaration has in fact been made under oath, it is an affidavit although no jurat be attached."") (quoting James v. Logan, 82 Kan. 285, 108 P. 81 (1910)); Land Clearance for Redevelopment Auth. of St. Louis v. Zitko, 386 S.W.2d 69, 78 (Mo.1964) (""the omission of a jurat will not render a properly executed affidavit a nullity""); King v. State, 167 Tex.Crim. 440, 320 S.W.2d 677, 678 (App.1959) (""When a jurat on its face is defective, the fact that it was properly sworn to may be shown by other evidence."") (citing Stanzel v. State, 112 Tex.Crim. 628, 18 S.W.2d 158,160 (App.1929)).
The principal exception involves situations in which the jurat is blank and the affidavit lacks both the notary's signature and the official notary seal. In such cases, some courts have been unwilling to allow extrinsic proof that the affidavit was in fact executed in the presence of a notary. State v. Phippen, 244 N.W.2d 574 (Iowa 1976); Miller v. Palo Alto Bd. of Supervisors, 248 Iowa 1132, 84 N.W.2d 38 (1957).
In short, the superior court properly concluded that sufficient evidence was presented at trial to allow the jury to find that the written statement signed by the Knixes in Swafford's presence on May 21, 1992, amounted to perjury: a ""false sworn statement which [the Knixes did] not believe to be true."" AS 11.56.200(a)."
"Prior to the conclusion of the Knixes' trial, Judge Murphy conducted a painstakingly thorough on-record inquiry to determine whether the Knixes wished to exercise their right to testify at trial. During the inquiry, the Knixes made veiled, conelusory references to threats that had purportedly been made to them in connection with their contemplated exercise of the right to testify. However, despite repeated efforts by the trial court to delve into the nature of and circumstances surrounding the alleged threats, despite a break in proceedings to allow the Knixes to consult with their attorneys, and despite repeated assurances by Judge Murphy that the court stood ready to hear further information and to take appropriate curative action, the Knixes steadfastly refused to substantiate their vague claim of threats or to divulge any further information explaining their situation.
In response to questioning by Judge Murphy, each of the Knixes' trial attorneys denied threatening their clients, professed ignorance of any actual threats, and assured Judge Murphy that the Knixes had been thoroughly apprised of their right to testify. But defense counsel, too, spoke only in general terms: apparently seeking to avoid a violation of the attorney-client privilege, counsel declined to provide the court with any significant detail or to shed meaningful light on the situation.
Upon completion of the inquiry by Judge Murphy, neither the Knixes nor their attorneys requested any action or relief from the court. The case proceeded, and neither Knix testified. In spite of Judge Murphy's mid-trial offer of a post-trial inquiry into the alleged threats, neither the Knixes nor their trial attorneys ever requested a post-trial hearing. Now, however, the Knixes complain that they were coerced into remaining off the stand and that their waiver of the right to testify was involuntary."
"A trial judge faced with a defendant who, in the course of this process, voices fears of reprisal as a consequence of testifying — even vague and insubstantial fears — must do everything realistically possible to delve into the issue and elicit an informed, voluntary choice. To this end, the judge should invite a full disclosure by the defendant and the defendant's counsel of any purported threat, offer to invoke the full weight of the court's protective powers against the source of any threat, and conduct a thorough inquiry in response to any information disclosed. The judge should also ensure that the defendant has been provided an adequate opportunity to consult with counsel concerning any potential threats or pressure and should take appropriate measures in the event that an active conflict of interest between client and attorney comes to light.
In the Knixes' ease, Judge Murphy did all of the foregoing, but to no avail. When the judge received no response to his efforts, there was little else he could do. The inescapable corollary of the fundamental right to testify is the equally fundamental right to silence. Faced with the Knixes' persistent refusal to elaborate on their situation, Judge Murphy confronted a practical dilemma. On the one hand, the judge could hardly order the unwilling Knixes to take the stand and testify in their own defense. On the other hand, with nothing more than an unsubstantiated hint of threats and repeated assurances by the Knixes and their counsel that no further information was forthcoming, the judge could hardly stop the trial in midstream. As a practical and legal matter, Judge Murphy was powerless to do anything but what he did: require the Knixes to choose among their clearly explained options and to live with the consequences of their choices."
"The Knixes next argue that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the culpable mental state required for conviction of the offense of scheme to defraud. The trial court instructed the jury, in relevant part, that to prove the crime of scheme to defraud, the state was required to establish that the Knixes ""knowingly engaged in conduct constituting a scheme"" and ""that the scheme was to defraud one or more persons of $10,000[.]"" The Knixes now complain that the court should have instructed the jury that the state was required to prove not just that the Knix-es knowingly participated in a scheme, but that they did so with specific intent to defraud their victims.
Because the Knixes failed to object below to the elements of the offense instruction for scheme to defraud, we review their claim only for plain error. Hilbish v. State, 891 P.2d 841, 850 (Alaska App.1995). A plain error is one that is both obvious and obviously prejudicial. Id.; see also S.R.D. v. State, 820 P.2d 1088, 1095 (Alaska App.1991) (""A plain error is an obvious one that results in substantial prejudice.""); Reischman v. State, 746 P.2d 912, 915 (Alaska App.1987) (""In order to establish plain error, the appellant must show that the error was obvious and substantially prejudicial"").
Alaska's scheme to defraud statute, AS 11.46.600, does not specify a culpable mental state:
(a) A person commits the crime of scheme to defraud if the person engages in conduct constituting a scheme
(1) to defraud five or more persons or to obtain property or services from five or more persons by false or fraudulent pretense, representation, or promise and obtains property or services in accordance with the scheme; or"
"The state argues that in the absence of an explicitly designated culpable mental state, AS 11.81.610(b) controls the statute's interpretation. According to AS 11.81.610(b), when ""a provision of law defining an offense does not prescribe a culpable mental state, the culpable mental state [for] . conduct is 'knowingly[.]' "" The state concludes that this provision required proof that the Knixes ""knowingly"" engaged in a scheme to defraud.
The state's argument is sound as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough, for it ignores the ordinary and unmistakable meaning of the words ""scheme to defraud."" The ordinary definitions of both words strongly imply an element of intentionality. In relevant part, Webster's defines ""scheme"" as ""a plan or program of something to be done: a planned undertaking . as A. a crafty or unethical project[.]"" And Webster's defines ""defraud"" to mean ""to take or withhold from (one) some possession, right, or interest by calculated misstatement or perversion of truth, trickery, or other deception.""
Alaska's scheme to defraud statute provides no indication that the words ""scheme"" and ""defraud"" are used in anything other than their ordinary meaning. Neither word is defined in Alaska's criminal code. As defined by the dictionary, the individual words describe conduct directed toward a specific objective. These words are coupled in AS 11.46.600(a) by the purposive word ""to,"" yielding the statutory phrase, ""scheme to defraud,"" which unmistakably refers to purposive conduct — a scheme — that is intended to achieve a specific result — a fraud. The notion of intentional conduct is thus intrinsic in the ordinary meaning of the term ""scheme to defraud."""
"Subsections (a)[ (1) ] and [ (2) ] of the statute are based on 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (1970) and the revised versions of that provision appearing in the proposed Federal Criminal Code § 1437 95th Cong., 1st Sess. § 1734 (1977). The federal provision is commonly referred to as the mail fraud statute.
A substantial body of case law has developed around the mail fraud statute making it an effective tool in the area of consumer frauds. Because the language of the proposed statute in part parallels that of the mail fraud statute, it is expected that the judicial decisions under the federal provision will be highly relevant to the construction of the Code provision.
Commentary on the Alaska Revised Criminal Code, Senate Journal Supplement 47 (1978).
Case law interpreting the federal statute uniformly supports our conclusion that the phrase ""scheme to defraud"" describes purposeful conduct. Like Alaska's scheme to defraud provision, the federal mail fraud statute proscribes participation in a scheme to defraud and does not specify the applicable culpable mental state:
Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises . [uses the mail commits a felony].
18 U.S.C. § 1341. Federal courts construing the mail fraud statute's reference to ""scheme . to defraud"" unanimously agree that the phrase necessarily implies specific intent.
In short, we think the state mistaken in arguing that Alaska's scheme to defraud statute does not require proof of specific intent. We construe the statutory phrase ""scheme to defraud"" as meaning a scheme intended to defraud."
"The Knixes cannot plausibly claim that this instruction was erroneous in requiring proof of knowing participation in a scheme to defraud. If the instruction was erroneous at all, its error was one of omission: its failure to require proof of specific intent to defraud in addition to proof of knowing participation in a scheme. This point is well illustrated by the federal pattern jury instruction for the mail fraud statute, an instruction cited and relied on by the Knixes themselves. In relevant part, it requires the jury to find both knowing participation and specific intent to defraud:
(1) the defendants] . knowingly participated in a scheme . to defraud [or] . knowingly participated in a scheme to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises .
(2) the defendants did so with the intent to defraud[.]
Devitt, Blackmar & O'Malley, Federal Practice and Instructions, § 40.03 (1990).
As we have previously pointed out, the Knixes can belatedly complain of the instruction given below only if its omission of specific intent language amounted to plain error: that is, if the omission was obviously erroneous and substantially prejudiced the Knixes' trial. We find no obvious error or substantial prejudice. We reach this conclusion for precisely the reason that prompted us to hold that the crime of scheme to defraud requires proof of specific intent: the element of specific intent is implicit in the plain meaning of the words ""scheme to defraud."""
"Just as the phrase ""scheme to defraud"" unmistakably refers to conduct directed at achieving a conscious objective — obtaining property of another by fraud — so the trial court's instruction requiring the jury to find that the Knixes knowingly engaged in a scheme to defraud unmistakably communicated the need to find that the Knixes acted with specific intent to defraud — that they engaged in their scheme with the ""conscious objective . to cause that resultf.]"" AS 11.81.900(a)(1). And just as it is all but inconceivable that the Knixes could have knowingly engaged in a scheme to defraud without acting intentionally, so it is all but inconceivable that a reasonable juror could find them guilty of knowing participation in the scheme without necessarily concluding that they acted with specific intent to defraud.
The Knixes complain that the omission of specific intent language from their scheme to defraud instruction might have prejudiced them by allowing the jury to convict them for participating in a ""scheme that defraud[ed]"" rather than in a ""scheme to defraud."" (Emphasis by the Knixes.) The simple and sufficient answer to this complaint is that the court never told the jury to convict the Knix-es upon proof of a scheme ""that"" defrauded; rather, the court explicitly instructed the jury to convict only if convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that they engaged in a scheme ""to"" defraud.
As a matter of common sense, we think that this distinction is one that reasonable jurors would understand and correctly apply. The jury instructions as a whole said nothing to suggest that knowing participation in a scheme to defraud did not require a finding of intent to defraud. Moreover, at no point in its final argument to the jury did the state attempt to characterize scheme to defraud as a general intent, rather than a specific intent, crime. Indeed, the prosecution expressly characterized the Knixes' acts as intentional."
"We ordinarily presume that a jury follows the trial court's instructions. The record in this case provides no reason to suppose that the Knixes' jury strayed from its duty to heed the scheme to defraud instruction as actually given or that the jury interpreted the instruction in other than a common sense manner.
In summary, even though the disputed scheme to defraud instruction failed to expressly incorporate a specific intent requirement, the instruction did not preclude the jury from basing its verdict on proof of specific intent to defraud; to the contrary, the instruction implicitly required such proof. Absent an objection and a request for specific intent language, the instruction was legally sufficient as given; and under the circumstances of this ease, it resulted in no discernible prejudice. We find no plain error.
The Knixes' final claim is that their convictions for theft by deception (second-degree theft) should have merged with their scheme to defraud convictions. The state concedes error. We are empowered to accept this concession if it is supported by law and factually grounded. Marks v. State, 496 P.2d 66, 67-68 (Alaska 1972). We find that it is.
Under the charges and theory pursued by the state at trial, the fraudulent scheme for which the Knixes were convicted consisted of the individual acts of theft for which they were simultaneously convicted. Under the circumstances of this case, the thefts and the scheme to defraud involved no appreciable differences in intent or conduct; and in the specific factual context of this case, there was no significant variance in the basic societal interests served by the theft and scheme to defraud statutes. Double jeopardy thus precludes multiple punishment for these offenses. Whitton v. State, 479 P.2d 302, 312 (Alaska 1970)."
". Clint Knix was individually charged with and convicted of an additional count of perjury as a result of a false sworn statement he made on October 16, 1992. The circumstances surrounding this offense are not at issue here, and Knix does not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on the separate perjury count.
. The second form of ""sworn statement,"" defined in AS 11.56.240(2)(B), permits a perjury charge to be established without proof of an oath or affirmation when a statement is made ""under penalty of perjury"" by a person who certifies, in accordance with AS 09.63.020(a), that ""a notary public or other official empowered to administer oaths is unavailable!)]"" Since we conclude that sufficient evidence existed to prove that the Knix-es' statement was given under oath or affirmation, and so qualified as a ""sworn statement"" under AS 11.56.240(2)(A), we need not decide whether it also qualified as a sworn statement under AS 11.56.240(2)(B).
. AS 09.63.030(a) provides:
(a) When a document is required by law to be notarized, the person who executes the document shall sign and swear to or affirm it before an officer authorized by law to take the person's oath or affirmation and the officer shall certify on the document that it was signed' and sworn to or affirmed before the officer.
Subsection (b) of the same statute prescribes a generic form of certification that ""may be"" used by any officer who notarizes a document; subsection (c), which deals specifically with notaries (as opposed to other types of authorized officers), spells out the manner in which a notary must sign the document and affix the notary seal."
".See also United States v. Thai, 29 F.3d 785, 812 (2nd Cir.1994) (""An affirmation is simply a solemn undertaking to tell the truth; no special verbal formula is required.""); State v. Zamorsky, 159 N.J.Super. 273, 387 A.2d 1227, 1232 (App.Div.1978) (""The remaining step was to obtain from [the witness] . a solemn commitment that she would speak the truth. This is the substance of an oath, or of an affirmation or declaration, all of which are forms of attestation by which a witness signifies that [he or she] is bound in conscience to perform an act faithfully and truth-&Hy[.]"").
. The Knixes argue that LaVigne requires a knowing and voluntary on-record waiver of the right to testify. The state reads LaVigne as requiring something less: an on-record inquiry to ensure that the defendant understands that the right to testify is personal to the defendant and cannot be usurped by the defendant's counsel. LaVigne itself is ambiguous on this score. Although the LaVigne court appears to have been primarily concerned with the personal nature of the right to testify and the danger of that right being waived by counsel, the closing paragraph of the decision advises:
To avoid future cases such as LaVigne's, we believe that trial judges should take steps to insure that a criminal defendant's failure to take the stand in his or her own defense was the result of a knowing and voluntary decision made by the defendant. To accomplish this, we believe judges should make an on-the-record inquiry after the close of the defendant's case, although out of the jury's hearing, into whether a nontestifying defendant understands and voluntarily waives his right. Such action insures a valid waiver of the defendant's right."
"A notable exception is the constitutionally protected right to counsel, whose corollary is the constitutionally protected right to self-representation. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Within this corollary pair, however, the right to counsel is clearly dominant, and right to self-representation is clearly subordinate. A criminal defendant who does not affirmatively and expressly waive the right to counsel must proceed with legal representation. But while forfeiture of the right to counsel is not tolerated, forfeiture of the right of self-representation is the established norm: the right is commonly ignored unless a defendant affirmatively asserts it, and even then, the trial court must attempt to discourage the defendant from proceeding without counsel and must ensure that the defendant is minimally qualified to pursue a course of self-representation.
The right to testify and its corollary, the right to silence, stand on unique footing. Both are fundamental and constitutionally enshrined. Neither has been established as clearly dominant over the other; they are equally vital. Yet one right is essentially active, while the other is passive: exercise of the right to testify requires the defendant's active participation; the right to silence can be asserted by complete inaction. And the two rights are mutually exclusive. A defendant cannot simultaneously exercise the right to testify and to remain silent. The exercise of one right necessarily entails a relinquishment of the other."
"In the present case, we assume that LaVigne does require a knowing and voluntary waiver, and we conclude that the record establishes that the Knixes did knowingly and voluntarily relinquish their right to testify. We thus avoid the hypothetical problems illustrated above. These hypotheticals, however, counsel against a hasty conclusion that LaVigne should be construed to hold that knowing and voluntary on-record waiver of the right to testify will always be required when a criminal defendant declines to testify.
. The Knixes suggest on appeal that Judge Murphy might have conducted in camera proceedings in the absence of their attorneys or ordered independent counsel appointed for the limited purpose of consulting with them concerning the exercise of their right to testify. These measures were neither suggested nor requested below. Conducting in camera proceedings in the absence of counsel or appointing special consultative counsel would inevitably have intruded upon the existing relationship between the Knixes and their trial counsel. Measures of this kind could be justified, if at all, only upon a substantial showing of necessity. Nothing in the record indicates the existence at trial of a potential conflict between the Knixes and their attorneys warranting interference with the Knixes' established attorney-client relationships. And nothing suggests that either of the Knixes would have been more forthcoming in camera than they were in the courtroom.
. Moreover, even assuming the Knixes had established a LaVigne violation, the error would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. To make a threshold showing of prejudice stemming from denial of the right to testify, the Knixes were required to show that they would have offered relevant testimony if allowed to testify at trial. LaVigne, 812 P.2d at 221. To date, the Knixes have made no showing that any testimony they proposed to give might have been relevant; indeed, they have never unequivocally asserted that they actually would have testified had the trial court undertaken further efforts to elicit a voluntary waiver."
". See, e.g"" United States v. McNeive, 536 F.2d 1245, 1247 (8th Cir.1976) (""Since the term 'scheme to defraud' connotes some degree of planning by the perpetrator, it is essential that the evidence show the defendant entertained an intent to defraud.""); United States v. Nance, 502 F.2d 615, 618 (8th Cir.1974) ("" 'Scheme' to defraud within the purview of this section involves some connotation of planning and pattern. Thus, intent to defraud is an essential element.""); see also United States v. Kreimer, 609 F.2d 126 (5th Cir.1980); United States v. Van Dyke, 605 F.2d 220 (6th Cir.1979); United States v. Beecroft, 608 F.2d 753 (9th Cir.1979); United States v. Williams, 545 F.2d 47 n. 2 (8th Cir.1976) (""The government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with an intent to defraud under § 1341.""); United States v. Jones, 425 F.2d 1048 (9th Cir.1970); United States v. Koenig, 388 F.Supp. 670 (S.D.N.Y.1974).
. We note that the legislature has defined ""intent to defraud"" in AS 11.46.990(10) as meaning:
(A) an intent to injure someone's interest which has value or an intent to use deception; or
(B) knowledge that the defendant is facilitating a fraud or injury to be perpetrated or inflicted by someone else.
.Alaska Pattern Jury Instruction (Criminal) 46.600 reads, in relevant part:

"OPINION
SHORTELL, Justice Pro Tem.
In this appeal, we are called upon to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in ordering Arbelovsky's and Garcia's case dismissed with prejudice. We reverse.
I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
On February 4, 1991, plaintiffs Frank Ar-belovsky and Chris Garcia (the plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit against City Electric, Inc. (City Electric) and a group of defendants that consists of Ebasco Services, Inc., Ebasco Constructors, Inc., and Enserch Constructors, J.V. (ECJV) (City Electric and ECJV are referred to collectively as ""the defendants""). ECJV was served in March 1991. ECJV answered the complaint on April 17, 1991. Two and one-half years later, on July 2, 1993, the plaintiffs served the complaint and summons on City Electric. City Electric moved to dismiss the suit under Civil Rule 41(e) for failure to prosecute because more than one year had passed ""without any proceedings having been taken."" On August 11, 1993, the superior court dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. Prior to becoming aware of the court's August 11 dismissal without prejudice, ECJV filed a motion for dismissal with prejudice. On August 20, 1993, the plaintiffs refiled their lawsuit against the defendants. City Electric joined ECJV's motion to dismiss with prejudice on August 27, 1993. The superior court denied this motion as moot in light of the August dismissal without prejudice. However, the court noted that the defendants could raise their claim for dismissal with prejudice in the case refiled on August 20."
"Perhaps due to a mistaken belief that their motion for reconsideration automatically stayed the order to pay costs and fees, the plaintiffs did not mail payment until June 23, 1994, and defendants did not receive it until June 27, 1994. Thus, payment was tendered thirteen days after the June 10 due date.
On June 22, 1994, ECJV filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice for failure to obey the court's order to pay fees and costs. City Electric joined the motion. These motions to dismiss were based solely on the failure to pay costs and fees in a timely manner. The next day, June 23,1994, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motions, arguing that their May 19 motion for reconsideration stayed the May 11 orders and that they had made pay ment immediately after reconsideration was denied.
On June 30, 1994, the court (apparently prematurely) denied the motion to dismiss. On July 7, the plaintiffs filed an additional opposition to the motion. The defendants subsequently moved for reconsideration of the denial of the motion. The court granted reconsideration on July 29,1994, and vacated its June 30 order. The court scheduled oral argument on the motions to dismiss for September 22,1994.
Counsel for the plaintiffs did not appear at the September 22 hearing. The court attempted to contact plaintiffs' counsel at his office, but received only an outdated message. After proceeding with oral argument in the absence of the plaintiffs' counsel, Judge Link granted the pending motions.
Judge Link expressed frustration -with the fact that his orders had not been followed in a timely manner. He noted that the sanctions he had imposed for failure to prosecute should have warned the plaintiffs to pay particular attention to the case. He expressed concerns about the ability of the defendants to litigate the case because of the time that had passed since the case was filed and said that he thought that sanctions short of dismissal with prejudice would not be sufficient to make up for the injuries suffered by the defendants. He dismissed the case with prejudice."
"A trial court's decision to dismiss a case with prejudice is evaluated under the abuse of discretion standard of review. Power Constructors, Inc. v. Acres Am., 811 P.2d 1052, 1054 (Alaska 1991). Under the abuse of discretion standard, the trial court's decision will only be overturned if this court has ""a definite and firm conviction that the judge made a mistake."" City of Kenai v. Ferguson, 732 P.2d 184, 190 (Alaska 1987).
A trial court's discretion to order litigation-ending sanctions is severely limited, whether the dismissal is requested as a discovery sanction under Civil Rule 37, or for non-compliance with court orders pursuant to Civil Rule 41(b), or as a result of a litigant's failure to prosecute a claim as required by Civil Rule 41(e). There must be ""willful noncompliance"" with court orders, or ""extreme circumstances,"" or ""gross violations"" of the Rules. The record must also ""clearly indicate a reasonable exploration of possible and meaningful alternatives to dismissal."" Power Constructors, 811 P.2d at 1055. Exploration of alternative sanctions will not be assumed if the record is inadequate, nor will conclusory rejection of all sanctions short of dismissal be accepted as a reasonable exploration of meaningful alternatives. Hughes, 875 P.2d at 753. If meaningful alternative sanctions are available, the trial court must ordinarily impose these lesser sanctions rather than a dismissal with prejudice. Power Constructors, 811 P.2d at 1055, citing Zeller v. Poor, 577 P.2d 695, 697 (Alaska 1978); see also Mely, 409 P.2d at 983 (holding Rule 41(b) sanction of dismissal with prejudice too harsh)."
"Judge Link considered more, however, than the minimal delay in payment in entering his dismissal order. He took into consideration the history of the case, his prior dismissal without prejudice, the frustrating, unresponsive conduct of the plaintiffs and their lawyer, and the defendants' assertions of prejudice resulting from that conduct. He appears to have expanded the issues before him to encompass arguments for dismissal with prejudice raised in prior motions. He decided that alternative sanctions short of complete dismissal would be inadequate under the circumstances.
To the extent the dismissal here was ordered based on the trial court's re-evaluation of arguments made in prior defense motions, the findings supporting his dismissal order are problematic for a number of reasons.
First, attorneys' fees to compensate the defendants for prior dilatory conduct had been deemed adequate sanctions shortly before the final dismissal order was entered. Although the defendants complained that these fees were inadequate compensation under the circumstances, there would seem to be nothing hindering the trial court from ordering increased monetary sanctions against the plaintiffs for their latest transgressions, including, perhaps, compensation for all attorneys' fees reasonably spent on the latest motions. Further prosecution of the lawsuit could have been conditioned on payment of those fees.
Second, the passage of time and its effect on the defendants was the focus of the trial court's concern at the September 22 hearing. Prior to that hearing, the court had never found that the passage of time had prejudiced the defendants. The evidence in support of those assertions was not particularly strong. ECJV's initial motion to dismiss with prejudice was supported solely by the affidavit of its lawyer. Fairly summarized, that affidavit stated that ECJV's lawyer had been informed that the ECJV joint venture had terminated, that one of the joint ventur-ers had gone out of business, that the offices of the other joint venturers had relocated out of Alaska, that five of the employees of the joint venturer no longer worked for any of the ECJV defendants, that ""none of these persons has been interviewed or contacted"" regarding the lawsuit, and that locating joint venture records as of August 1998 would be ""unusually difficult and expensive."""
"No further evidence of prejudice was brought to the court's attention in any of the defendants' subsequent motions to dismiss. The only supplementary proof on this issue consisted of three affidavits submitted in support of ECJV's May 1994 motion for protective order. Two of these affidavits were signed by ex-employees of ECJV; they described with more particularity the expense and difficulty of finding records from the project and locating its prior employees. Significantly, neither of these affidavits actually said that any particular employee could not be located after diligent efforts had been attempted. The third affidavit was signed by ECJV's lawyer. It set out at greater length his previous affidavit's assertions of difficulty and expense of locating pertinent ECJV documents and identifying those that were discoverable.
The proof available to the court on September 22, 1994 on all motions, including motions other than the pending motions to dismiss, showed no more than that future discovery would be an expensive and difficult process, and witnesses might be difficult to locate.
Judge Link had considered these assertions before. He had reserved the option of ordering the plaintiffs to pay up to $10,000.00 of future discovery costs ""pending a showing of how much cost is attributable to delay and how much would have been incurred with a timely prosecution."" He could have ordered payment of these fees as a condition of continued prosecution if the proof had been supplemented appropriately. It never was."
"III. CONCLUSION
The plaintiffs engaged in serious dilatory conduct. They inexcusably delayed prosecuting their case for years and the trial court appropriately dismissed the case without prejudice for the initial delay. It properly conditioned further prosecution of the case on the payment of costs and attorneys' fees. It reasonably reserved the option of requiring payment of further costs occasioned by the plaintiffs' delay and inactivity. But it abused its discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice after the plaintiffs did not comply promptly with its order for payment of costs and fees. Even assuming that the record showed the type of extreme eircum-stances required for such a dismissal, the trial court did not adequately explore possible and meaningful alternatives to dismissal. Further orders requiring payment of costs and fees occasioned by the plaintiffs' conduct might have been appropriate, as well as orders requiring pretrial discovery and trial preparation to be completed within a reasonable time. These measures and appropriate sanctions for failure to comply with them in the future are still available to the trial court.
The trial court's order dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice is REVERSED.
EASTAUGH, J., not participating.
.ECJV's motion states:
Come now the defendants . and move for an order dismissing the plaintiffs' claims against them herein with prejudice, in accordance with this court's order dated May 11, 1994.
The attached affidavit of counsel read:"
"3. More than 30 days has elapsed since the date of the Order without the plaintiffs making payment to the ECJV defendants in accordance with that order. Plaintiffs have made no payment to the ECJV defendants and, insofar as the ECJV defendants are aware, have not provided the court with any sort of proof of payment. Therefore, according to the terms of the May 11, 1994 Order, plaintiffs' case against the ECJV defendants should be dismissed with prejudice.
City Electric's July 5, 1994 joinder in ECJV's motion to dismiss with prejudice states:
City Electric, Inc., joins in Enserch's motion to dismiss the above-referenced case with prejudice for failure to pay court ordered costs and attorney's fees in a timely fashion. City Electric received payment from Mr. Collins' trust account well past the deadline set by the court for payment of costs and fees. Payment was received by uncertified check in the law offices of Guess & Rudd on June 27, 1994. See Affidavit of Cynthia L. Ducey attached. The check has been deposited in Guess & Rudd's trust account to ensure that it will clear. Pursuant to the court's order, payment was to have been received no later than June 15, 1994 (payment to be made ""within 30 days"" of the May 11, 1994 order). Payment is untimely and the case should be dismissed with prejudice. This is simply the latest in a series of failures by Mr. Collins to prosecute the case or to follow court orders. The case should be dismissed with prejudice.

. He said:
[W]ell, I can't pass judgment on the validity of the plaintiffs' claims, I don't know anything about them, but I do know that the affidavits that have been submitted saying how hard this thing is to defend as a result of the passage in time make perfect sense. The JV has been dissolved, the records are at different parts of the country, people have retired, moved to different parts of the country, memories have faded. You know, there comes a point in time when enough is enough, and this is enough.
If there was a way to level the playing field, for example, if I could require that plaintiffs paid each defendant $25,000.00 and costs and attorney fees or something so that the attorneys could be compensated for the amount of time they spent trying to make plaintiff comply with the Civil Rules and the case could then proceed on an even playing field level — on a level playing field, I'd probably do that. But I can't because of the dissipation of the evidence that the defendants need to defend this case. That sanction wouldn't work. I've tried everything else. So it's, as far as I'm concerned, the system simply can't tolerate any more of the abuse that it's taken, and I don't expect the defendants to.
. This motion was denied by Judge Link as moot. In denying this motion, Judge Link said: ""The parties are also advised that this court believes that affidavits given in support of motions to dismiss must be made from personal knowledge.""
. This is not to say that a party's past record of misconduct is off-limits to a court when it considers imposition of sanctions. On the contrary, the scope and duration of prior misconduct should be considered in determining whether sanctions should he imposed and how severe they should be. But the ultimate sanction of dismissal with prejudice should be reserved for cases in which lesser sanctions are not reasonably available or the misconduct of the party being sanctioned is so egregious that a lesser sanction would be inappropriate. Even if prejudice need not be shown in all cases involving unreasonable delay, Power Constructors, 811 P.2d at 1056 n. 7, in cases such as this, where the court actually considered prejudice as a disposi-tive factor supporting its dismissal order, the evidentiary record must support its conclusion that the most drastic sanction available should be applied."
"RABINOWITZ, Justice.
I. INTRODUCTION
The superior court determined that R.C., the natural child of T.B., is a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A), (C), and (F), and that it is in the best interests of R.C. for the State to retain custody of him for two years. T.B., R.C.'s mother, who was earing for R.C. until the State interceded, now brings this appeal.
II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
T.B. is R.C.'s mother. A Colorado court terminated her parental rights in 1988, after finding that she had abandoned R.C. and had not complied with a rehabilitation plan. The Colorado court awarded custody first to R.C.'s grandfather, and then to R.C.'s uncle, G.C. Thereafter, G.C. executed two separate powers of attorney giving custody of R.C. to T.B. The first one, executed on December 18, 1990, was entitled ""Special Power of Attorney and Grant of Temporary Custody"" and was effective ""until its revocation by me."" The second one, executed on October 13, 1994, contained similar language, but was entitled, ""Special Power of Attorney and Grant of Permanent Custody."" On December 23, 1990, R.C. arrived in Alaska, and lived with T.B. until May 1993, at which time the State took emergency custody of him.
In November of 1992, T.B. withdrew R.C. from school. She re-enrolled him on January 21, 1993. He missed about six weeks of classes. The previous spring, R.C. had been severely injured when another child kicked him in the testicles. T.B. claims that R.C. was assaulted again in the fall of 1992, which prompted her to withdraw him from school. She attempted to enroll him in a home schooling program, but when her application was denied, she returned R.C. to school."
"Following the State's exercise of emergency custody in the wake of the May 18 incident, the State designed a plan which would enable T.B. to resume caring for R.C. The plan called for her to attend regular meetings at Alcoholics Anonymous, complete parenting classes, participate in a psychological evaluation, have regular meetings with R.C., and complete individual and family counseling. However, T.B. did not comply with the treatment plan. The superior court found that she attended only four of six parenting classes, that she visited R.C. only ""sporadically,"" that she did not provide the court with a record of AA meetings, and that she did not undergo counseling. The superior court noted that T.B. claimed that her failure to complete the program set up by the State was caused by the distance between her home and the location of the classes and by her inability to afford cab fare to the location of the classes.
The superior court determined that R.C. is a child in need of aid pursuant to AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A), (C), and (F). The superi- or court then awarded custody of R.C. to the Department of Health and Social Services for up to two years and also provided for visitations with T.B.
T.B. appeals the superior court's classification of R.C. as a child in need of aid and also appeals the superior court's dispositional order awarding custody to the Department of Health and Social Services.
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
A superior court's finding that a child is in need of aid will be overturned if this court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. In the Matter ofAS.W., 834 P.2d 801, 806 (Alaska 1992). Factual findings supporting the superior court's determination that a minor is a child in need of aid are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. A.H. v. State, 779 P.2d 1229, 1231 (Alaska 1989)."
"A. Did the Superior Court Err in Holding that R.C. Is a Child in Need of Aid?
Since the superior court articulated three separate grounds in support of its conclusion that R.C. is a child in need of aid, we address each in turn.
1. Did the superior court err in concluding that R.C. is a child in need of aid pursuant to AS 17.10.010(a)(2)(C)?
In its Memorandum of Decision the superi- or court found:
1. This Court has jurisdiction of this case for purposes of adjudication and disposition under the provisions of A.S. 47.10.010(a)(2)(C).
2. As a result of actions done by or conditions created by R.C.'s mother, T.B., on May 18, 1993, there was an imminent and substantial risk that R.C. would suffer substantial physical harm. R.C. thwarted the risk of harm by his actions in seeking assistance from Jessica Townsend. Jessica Townsend thwarted the risk of harm to R.C. by her actions in assisting R.C. and in preventing T.B.'s access to R.C. during the incident.
Alaska Statute 47.10.010(a)(2)(C) provides for jurisdiction over a child who is in need of aid as a result of
the child having suffered substantial physical harm or if there is an imminent and substantial risk that the child mil suffer such harm as a result of the actions done by or conditions created by the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or the failure of the parent, guardian, or custodian adequately to supervise the child[.]
(Emphasis added).
Our review of the record leads us to the conclusion that sufficient evidentiary support is lacking for the superior court's conclusion that ""[a]s a result of actions done by or conditions created by R.C.'s mother, T.B., on May 18, 1993, there was an imminent and substantial risk that R.C. would suffer substantial physical harm"" under AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(C). Essentially, after R.C. swung a sword at a motorcycle (or possibly at a person), T.B. yelled at R.C. and threatened him. This may have been an overreaction to the incident. However, this isolated incident, without evidence that T.B. was prone to violence or that T.B. had any history of violence towards R.C., falls short of establishing an imminent and substantial risk that the child will suffer substantial physical harm. See F.T. v. State, 862 P.2d 867 (Alaska 1993) (where the state presented no direct evidence concerning father's alleged physical abuse of son, insufficient evidence existed to support the superior court's adjudication under AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(C)); In the Matter of S.A, 912 P.2d 1235, 1238 (Alaska 1996) (""Likewise, the testimony that [the mother] sometimes disciplines [her children] by yelling at them cannot justify a CINA adjudication under subsection (C)."")."
"2. Did the superior court err in concluding that R.C. is a child in need of aid pursuant to AS 17.10.010(a)(2)(F)?
The superior court found that R.C. is a child in need of aid under the terms of AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(F). More particularly, in its Memorandum of Decision it stated:
The Court concludes that as a result of T.B.'s action in withholding R.C. from school from November, 1992 through January, 1993, he suffered substantial neglect.
Alaska Statute 47.10.010(a)(2)(F) provides for jurisdiction over a child who is in need of aid as a result of ""the child having suffered substantial physical abuse or neglect as a result of conditions created by the child's parent, guardian, or custodian."" (Emphasis added).
Our review of the evidence persuades us that support for an adjudication of R.C. as a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(F) is lacking. T.B. claims that she withdrew R.C. from school soon after he was assaulted at a school bus stop. This assault followed an assault the previous spring which caused serious injuries to R.C.
During R.C.'s absence from school, T.B. attempted to enroll him in a home schooling program. When her application for home schooling was denied, she re-enrolled R.C. in school. While T.B. should have attempted to enroll R.C. in the home schooling program before withdrawing him from school, her actions do not constitute ""substantial physical neglect.""
In Matter of S.D., Jr., 549 P.2d 1190, 1197-98 (Alaska 1976), we held that parents show neglect or a lack of proper care when they keep their children from attending school for an extended period of time without ""some justifiable reason."" Here T.B.'s concern for her son's health and safety constitutes a justifiable reason, especially given the history of assaults committed against him."
"3. Did the superior court err in concluding that R.C. is a child in need of aid pursuant to AS 4.7.10.010(a)(2)(A)?
Alaska Statute 47.10.010(a)(2)(A) provides for jurisdiction over a child who is in need of aid- as a result of ""the child being habitually absent from home or refusing to accept available care, or having no parent, guardian, custodian, or relative caring or willing to provide care_"" (Emphasis added).
In its Memorandum of Decision the superior court determined that it ""must give full faith and credit to the ORDER TERMINATING THE PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP, issued in the Matter of R.C-by the District Court of the State of Colorado _ According to that order, T.B.'s personal right to R.C. was terminated, and R.C.'s legal custody and guardianship was granted to R.C. and F.C. [the minor's maternal grandparents]."" Custody was later transferred to the minor's uncle, G.C. The superior court additionally found that ""R.C. has no parent, guardian, custodian or relative caring or willing to provide care"" and determined that R.C. is a child in need of aid pursuant to AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A).
On appeal, T.B. claims that the superior court erred in holding that she was not R.C.'s custodian during the relevant times. She argues that the powers of attorney executed by G.C. appointed her custodian of R.C. The State advances two reasons for upholding the superior court.
First, the State argues that, under CIÑA Rule 2(b), G.C. had no authority to appoint T.B. as a custodian. Rule 2(b) states:"
"(Emphasis added). Accordingly, the State claims that, since G.C. was merely R.C.'s guardian and not his parent, he had no authority to appoint T.B. as a custodian. We view the State's argument as exceedingly technical. Common sense dictates that a legal guardian who has all the authority of a parent may do what a parent may do, so if a parent may appoint a custodian, a guardian may also appoint one.
Additionally, it is not clear that CINA Rule 2(b) provides the definition of ""custodian"" for purposes of AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A), since Chapter 10 of Title 47 provides no definition of ""custodian."" See AS 47.10.990. Furthermore, AS 13.26.020 states:
A parent or guardian of a minor or incapacitated person, by a properly executed power of attorney, may delegate to another person, for a period not exceeding one year, any powers regarding care, custody, or property of the minor child or ward, except the power to consent to marriage or adoption of a minor ward.
We believe that the provisions of AS 13.26.020 are relevant and controlling in in terpreting AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A). In short, G.C. had authority, pursuant to AS 13.26.020, to appoint a custodian for R.C.
The State also argues that G.C. lacked authority to appoint T.B. as R.C.'s custodian for an indefinite period of time. This is because AS 13.26.020, quoted above, permits custodians to be appointed for only one year. Accordingly, under G.C.'s December 18, 1990 power of attorney appointing T.B. as a custodian, T.B.'s appointment expired in December 1991, approximately one and one-half years before the State took emergency custody of R.C. Technically speaking, then, R.C. had no custodian after December 1991 willing to assume care for him after the State took custody."
"T.B.'s care for R.C. for approximately two and a half years under the power of attorneys and guardianship documents certainly qualifies her at the very least as a custodian.
There is merit in T.B.'s argument. T.B. exercised actual care of and had sole custody of R.C. for a period of approximately two and one-half years immediately prior to the May 18, 1993 incident which culminated in the State's taking emergency custody of R.C. Considering this fact, we think it just and appropriate to characterize T.B. as a custodian willing to provide care for R.C. Given our conclusion that T.B. functioned as R.C.'s de facto custodian, we hold that the superior court erred in adjudicating R.C. a child in need of aid under the provisions of AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A).
V. CONCLUSION
The superior court's judgment that R.C. is a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A), (C), and (F) is REVERSED and VACATED. Additionally, the superior court's judgment granting custody of R.C. to the State for a period of two years is REVERSED and VACATED.
. There is some indication that R.C. attempted to strike the person who was on the motorcycle.
. AS 47.10.010 provides in part:
(a) Proceedings relating to a minor under 18 years of age residing or found in the state are governed by this chapter, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, when the court finds the minor
(2) to be a child in need of aid as a result of (A) the child being habitually absent from home or refusing to accept available care, or having no parent, guardian, custodian, or relative caring or willing to provide care .;"
"(F) the child having suffered substantial physical abuse or neglect as a result of conditions created by the child's parent, guardian, or custodian.
. The State claims that the school investigated the bus stop incident, and determined that no assault took place. The superior court did not make a finding as to whether this assault took place, but rather stated, ""According to T.B. she removed R.C. from school because of assaultive behavior directed at him by peers.""
.In Matter of S.D., Jr., we referred to AS 14.30.010, which requires parents and guardians to ""maintain the child in attendance at a public school...."" AS 14.30.010 also lists circumstances pursuant to which a child will be excused from attending a public school. It might be inferred that in Matter of S.D., Jr., we intended to limit ""justifiable reason[s]"" to the exceptions listed in AS 14.30.010. Matter of S.D., Jr. should not be interpreted in such a manner. Circumstances might arise, such as those in the case at bar, where an absence from school is not justified by the exceptions noted in As 14.30.010, but which nevertheless do not warrant characterizing the minor as a child in need of aid.
. The superior court further found that
[tjhe powers of attorney executed by G.C. have no legal significance as to T.B.'s status as R.C.'s mother or guardian. G.C. lacked the legal capacity to make either designation.
. No restrictions regarding R.C.'s uncle's guardianship have been brought to our attention.
. A State social worker testified that she was not aware of any other relatives who are willing to care for R.C. However, the Guardian Ad Litem's report filed in conjunction with the dispositional phase of the proceedings notes that R.C.'s grandmother is willing to care for R.C. The superior court did not note this discrepancy in its findings, but rather stated that R.C. had no ""parent, guardian, custodian, or relative caring or willing to provide care."" Since R.C.'s grandmother is apparently willing to care for R.C., the superior court erred in deciding that R.C. is a child in need of aid under AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A). However, as explained below, we conclude that T.B. also qualified to care for R.C. under AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A)."
"We note that our holding makes it unnecessary to address whether T.B. might also qualify as a ""relative"" within the terms of AS 47.10.010(a)(2)(A).
.In this appeal the State has not argued that returning R.C. to the custody of T.B. would violate principles of full faith and credit given the Colorado court's judgment terminating T.B.'s parental rights.
Though the superior court accorded full faith and credit to the Colorado judgment severing T.B.'s parental rights, the superior court recognized T.B. as a ""party to this proceeding by order made in open court on October 14, 1993."" Additionally, the superior court mentioned in its findings of fact that the ""DFYS developed a case plan, the object of which was to return R.C. to family custody."" Thus, it seems likely that, had T.B. completed the program to the satisfaction of the State, it would not have attempted to have R.C. adjudicated as a child in need of aid.
T.B. never asked the superior court to revoke the Colorado court's severance of her parental rights, as she had perhaps the right to do. In Rita T. v. State, 623 P.2d 344, 347 (Alaska 1981), we said:
We conclude that as long as a child remains the ward of the court, under AS 47.10.080(f) his or her natural parents are entitled to a review of the order terminating their parental rights....
See also AS 47.10.080(f).
Since the matter of the restoration of T.B.'s parental rights was not raised below and not briefed in this appeal, we decline to address this complex issue which necessarily involves issues of full faith and credit."
"I. INTRODUCTION
Paul Tipton appeals the superior court's affirmance of the decision of the Alaska Workers' Compensation Board (Board) dismissing his workers' compensation claim. The Board held that AS 23.30.110(c) barred Tipton's claim because he failed to request a hearing within two years after an earlier hearing had been cancelled. We reverse.
II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
On April 23, 1984, Paul Tipton was severely injured while in the course of his employment with ARCO Alaska, Inc. As a result of his injury, Tipton received temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, temporary partial disability (TPD) benefits, and permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits. In the spring of 1985, ARCO offered a number of employees incentives to resign. Tipton took advantage of this ""special termination plan"" and resigned, effective September 28, 1985.
On May 6, 1987, Tipton filed with the Board an Application for Adjustment of Claim, claiming entitlement to additional TTD and PPD benefits. Along with the application, Tipton filed a Statement of Readiness to Proceed (SRP) in which he requested a hearing on the matter. On July 16, ARCO filed a Notice of Controversion. The hearing, scheduled for October 1, 1987, was continued by stipulation of the parties.
On March 23, 1988, Tipton filed a second SRP. A hearing was scheduled for Septena- ber 1, 1988. The Board cancelled the SRP on September 2, 1988, apparently because the parties had reached a tentative settlement. ARCO drafted the proposed settlement agreement and mailed it to Tipton on September 20, 1988. Tipton refused to sign the agreement because he felt it required him to release all claims against ARCO."
"In September 1991, ARCO filed a petition to dismiss Tipton's workers' compensation claim. The Board granted the petition, concluding that Tipton's claim was barred by AS 23.30.110(c), because he had not requested a hearing within two years after the cancellation of the September 1, 1988 hearing. On appeal to the superior court, see Aaska Appellate Rule 602, the court affirmed the Board's decision. Tipton appeals.
III. DISCUSSION
At issue is the interpretation and application of former AS 23.30.110(c) , which provided in part,
If a claim is controverted by the employer and the employee does not request a hearing for a period of two years following the date of controversion, the claim is denied.
Section 110(c) requires an employee to request a hearing within two years after the employer controverts the employee's claim. ARCO controverted Tipton's claim on July 16, 1987. Tipton requested a hearing on March 23, 1988, within two years of the date of controversion. Tipton's hearing request was cancelled because the parties were close to settling; however, the proposed settlement was never ratified by Tipton, and therefore his claim and hearing request were still before the Board. In this situation, there is nothing explicit or implicit in the language of section 110(c) which would require Tipton to request another hearing to avoid dismissal.
ARCO argues that in order to avoid the time-bar of section 110(c), an employee must request a hearing every time a hearing is cancelled. We do not read the provision so broadly. The defense of statute of limitations is ""generally disfavored,"" Lee Houston & Assocs. v. Racine, 806 P.2d 848, 854 (Alaska 1991), and neither '""the law [n]or the facts should be strained in aid of it.' "" Safeco Ins. Co. v. Honeywell, 689 P.2d 996, 1001 (Alaska 1981) (quoting Guy F. Atkinson Co. v. State, 66 Wash.2d 570, 403 P.2d 880, 882 (1965)). ARCO's interpretation does more than strain the language of section 110(c): it adds a proviso that simply is not there."
"IV. CONCLUSION
The Board's decision and the superior court's judgment are REVERSED. This ease is REMANDED to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
. The ""independent judgment"" standard of review applies to matters of statutory construction. State, Dep't of Nat. Resources v. City of Haines, 627 P.2d 1047, 1049 (Alaska 1981).
. AS 23.30.110(c) was amended in 1988. See § 48, ch. 79, SLA 1988. The version of AS 23.30.110(c) in effect prior to the 1988 amendments applies in this case. See Id. (providing that the 1988 amendments to section 110(c) apply only to injuries sustained on or after July 1, 1988).
. ARCO relies on Jonathan v. Doyon Drilling, Inc., 890 P.2d 1121 (Alaska 1995), to support its position. In Doyon Drilling, the employer filed a notice of controversion before the employee filed a claim with the Board. Id. at 1121-22. After the employee filed a claim, the employer controverted the claim a second time. Id. at 1122. The employee requested a hearing within two years of the employer's second controversion, but not within two years of the employer's initial controversion. Id. The question presented in Doyon Drilling was whether the limitations period in section 110(c) was triggered by a notice of controversion filed prior to the filing of an employee's written claim. Id. at 1122-25. We held that the ""the limitations period of section 110(c) is only triggered after the employee flies a claim."" Id. at 1124. Doyon Drilling does not address the issue of whether section 110(c) requires an employee to request a new hearing every time a hearing is cancelled."
"OPINION
RABINOWITZ, Justice.
I. .INTRODUCTION
This appeal arises out of an action brought by Michele Ramsey against the Washington Insurance Guaranty Association (WIGA). A jury awarded Ramsey $200,000 after finding that WIGA had violated its duty to reasonably settle an underlying personal injury action. In this appeal, WIGA argues that the superior court improperly determined that it had personal jurisdiction over WIGA. WIGA also contends that it is statutorily immune from an action for refusal to settle. WIGA further contends that because it did not violate any duty it owed to its insureds, and because there was no adverse judgment, as a matter of law WIGA was not liable under the covenant settlement which Ramsey entered into with the insureds. Finally, WIGA argues that the superior court erred in denying its motions for a directed verdict and judgment n.o.v. because there was no reasonable evidentiary basis for determining that the claim was worth $200,000. We affirm the superior court on all counts."
"The underlying action in this case was a negligence claim filed by Michele Ramsey against Paul Ursino and his employer Frank Coluccio Construction Company (Coluccio). Ramsey was working as a flag person at a construction site in Juneau. Ursino, who was working as a foreman on an unrelated construction project, drove to the Juneau site in a pickup truck owned by Coluccio to borrow some equipment. As Ursino approached, Ramsey tried to stop him. A dispute ensued during the course of which Ur-sino slowly drove into Ramsey, bumping her several times. Ramsey alleged that as a result she sustained knee injuries and emotional distress. Ramsey's claim against Co-luccio was based on a theory of respondeat superior as well as independent negligence. Ramsey sought both compensatory and punitive damages.
Coluccio was insured by Pacific Marine Insurance Co. (PACMAR), a Washington insurance company. On June 7, 1989, PAC-MAR was adjudged insolvent and WIGA stepped in to handle all claims against PAC-MAR. WIGA is a nonprofit unincorporated statutory entity established to ""avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer[.]"" WIGA functions to pool the risk of an insurer's insolvency by requiring each insurer licensed in the State of Washington to contribute to a fund an amount proportionate to its share of the total insurance premiums written in Washington during the preceding calendar year. WIGA is authorized to handle any claims filed against insolvent insurers, up to the statutory limit of $300,000. In carrying out this function WIGA is given broad authority to defend any action on a claim brought against the association, as well as to ""adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the association's obligation!;.]"" WIGA is governed by a Board of Directors, selected by the association members. However, its claims processing is generally handled through designated claims servicing facilities. Robert Lander, an independent contractor, was retained by WIGA as a ""claims manager"" and eventually oversaw the Ramsey claim."
"The case proceeded to trial in the superior court in Juneau. Immediately before and throughout the course of the trial the various parties attempted to settle the action. During this period Ramsey offered to settle the case for $200,000. In the midst of the trial, on November 9, Ramsey asked Superior Court Judge Carpeneti to intercede in the settlement negotiations. The parties' attorneys conferred with Judge Carpeneti. Both Drennan and Findley advised Lander to take the offer. Judge Carpeneti's assessment was that the case could end in a wide range of results but that as an estimate he would value the case at $175,000. At the close of the conference Lander deferred making any decision on the offer.
With WIGA refusing to settle, Coluccio and Ursino accepted an offer from Ramsey to enter into a consent judgment for $300,-000, the maximum claim allowed under the WIGA statute. The-settlement agreement included a covenant not to enforce the judgment against the parties personally. In exchange, Ursino and Coluccio assigned any claim they had against WIGA to Ramsey. This settlement ended the underlying litigation without a jury verdict and formed the basis for the present action.
Ramsey then filed a complaint against WIGA seeking payment of the $300,000 judgment as a covered claim. WIGA first filed an answer alleging inter alia that the Alaska courts lacked personal jurisdiction over it. The superior court held a hearing on this issue and ultimately denied WIGA's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. WIGA next filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that it had statutory immunity from any claim arising from its refusal to settle. The superior court denied this motion as well. It held that WIGA had a statutory duty to accept a reasonable settlement offer and therefore that this action did not fall within the ambit of WIGA's statutory immunity from all tort or contract actions."
"III. DISCUSSION
A. Did the Superior Court Properly Determine That it Had Personal Jurisdiction Over WIGA
In Alaska, personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant is conferred by our long-arm statute. ""We have construed this statute to extend Alaska's jurisdiction to the maximum reach consistent with the guarantees of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment."" Volkswagenwerk, AG. v. Klippan, GmbH, 611 P.2d 498, 500 (Alaska 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 974, 101 S.Ct. 385, 66 L.Ed.2d 236 (1980). Thus, the dis-positive question is whether assertion of jurisdiction under our long-arm statute in the instant case would violate WIGA's constitutional right to due process.
Ramsey makes two arguments that jurisdiction was proper in this case. First, she argues that WIGA's activities with regard to the underlying suit established sufficient ""minimum contacts"" in Alaska to make it reasonably foreseeable that it would be haled into court in this state. Second, she argues that WIGA stepped into the shoes of an insolvent insurance carrier which had sufficient contacts with Alaska, and that therefore jurisdiction may be conferred on WIGA as a successor in the litigation.
In order to pass constitutional muster, the acts of the nonresident defendant must establish sufficient ""minimum contacts"" with the forum state, such that maintaining a suit there ""does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' "" International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 158, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). As the superior court correctly noted,"
"Thus, the inquiry must focus on the nature of the defendant's contacts with the forum.
A number of other courts have addressed the issue of whether personal jurisdiction may be established over an out-of-state guaranty association. These courts are split as to whether personal jurisdiction may properly be maintained. Those that have decided that jurisdiction was constitutional have generally focused on the foreseeability to the guarantor that a covered claim might arise in the forum jurisdiction, when the insurers which they are guaranteeing insure risks in the forum state. Alternatively, the South Carolina Supreme Court relied on the idea that the guaranty association was the ""alter-ego"" of the insolvent insurance company. Bell v. Senn Trucking Co., 308 S.C. 364, 418 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1992). That court focused on specific statutory language in the Georgia statutes which states that the Georgia Pool is ""deemed to be the insurer for such period with respect [to] and to the extent of the claims with all the rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer....""
The courts which have found that jurisdiction would violate due process, on the other hand, state that jurisdiction over the guaranty association must be determined independently of the insurer. They note that the obligations of the guaranty association generally are not coextensive with those of the insurer because of limitations on the amount and type of claims which are covered. Thus, these courts conclude that the fund cannot be said to stand in the insurer's shoes, Pennsylvania Life & Health Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Superior Court, 22 Cal.App.4th 477, 27 Cal. Rptr.2d 507, 513 (1994), and that any obligation which arises in the forum state is solely a result of the guaranty association's statutory duty, rather than any action which it took in the forum state. Nor can the association be said to have derived an economic benefit from its connections with the forum state. Therefore there is no independent basis for establishing jurisdiction. See Pennsylvania Life, 27 Cal.Rptr.2d at 513. Finally, these courts also reason that these funds have an important social purpose which might be undermined if they are required to bear the expense of litigating in multiple jurisdictions. Id. at 515; Brewer, 602 So.2d at 1269."
"WIGA wrote letters and telephoned Ramsey's attorney about her claim and the pending lawsuit; WIGA hired attorneys to defend the Ramsey claim and to represent the insureds; WIGA authorized offers of judgment to settle Ramsey's claim; WIGA maintained contact with the insureds attorneys and it advised the attorneys on aspects of the settlement negotiations; WIGA took part in the settlement conference, moved to intervene and stated its objections to the proposed settlement on the record. These contacts are not ""minimum"". WIGA came to this jurisdiction to defend a claim and it would be unreasonable to think that it would not be called back into court concerning the Ramsey judgment.
In contrast, in each of the other cases cited by the parties, the guaranty association raised the personal jurisdiction issue at the outset of their proceedings in the forum state.
WIGA responds to this line of reasoning by arguing that it was required by statute to engage in these activities and thus it did not undertake ""deliberate and purposeful acts by which the defendant is considered to have availed itself of the forum state's law."" WIGA cites Northpark Nat'l Bank v. Bankers Trust Co., 572 F.Supp. 520 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), where a federal court held that check clearing activities performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for New York banks could not be used to establish personal jurisdiction in New York. Despite the fact that the FRBC derived more than $1.2 million in fees from performing this activity, it was statutorily required to perform this function, and the fees which were charged were intended solely to cover the costs of this service. The court therefore concluded that it was not the type of ""affirmative and voluntary act"" which was necessary to establish jurisdiction. Id. at 522-23. Similarly, in the present case, although the actions taken by WIGA in Alaska may have been sufficient quantitatively, WIGA argues that they are not of the character necessary to establish minimum contacts. WIGA was merely engaging in its statutory duty to defend the underlying suit brought by Ramsey, and it derived no economic benefit from its actions in the forum."
"Nor did the superior court err in determining that the establishment of jurisdiction comports with ""fair play and substantial justice."" We have stated that
[i]n making this determination, we are called upon to evaluate the burden on the defendant, the forum state's interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiffs interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and the shared interest of the states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.
American Nat'l Bank v. International Sea-foods, 735 P.2d 747 (Alaska 1987). WIGA argues that assertion of jurisdiction by the courts of Alaska would unnecessarily tax WIGA's resources and would therefore undermine the statutory purpose of protecting insureds and claimants in the State of Washington. We think this argument is unpersuasive. First, if there were no personal jurisdiction in Alaska, nothing would prevent Ramsey from bringing a similar claim in Washington. Thus, WIGA would bear the expense of litigation anyway. Second, WIGA presented no evidence that its potential exposure in other jurisdictions is excessively large, or that its purpose is in any way threatened by being forced to litigate in other jurisdictions. Finally, as the superior court noted, any additional costs could be effectively passed on to the insurance companies and their consumers through increased assessments. We conclude that the superior court of Alaska's exercise of personal jurisdiction over WIGA does not violate WIGA's due process rights."
"The Washington Insurance Guaranty Association Act has a general immunity provision, RCW 48.32.150, which states:
There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against any member insurer, the association or its agents or employees, the board of directors, or the commissioner or his representatives for any action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this chapter.
WIGA argues that this language immunizes it from a claim for refusal to settle.
RCW 48.32 is based on the Posft-Assessment Property and Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act, which was drafted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and adopted in the vast majority of states. Washington adopted the statute in 1971. RCW 48.32.010. The operative language of section 48.32.150 is identical to the language in the model act.
In our view, the plain meanings of the immunity provision of the statute and other provisions of the statute refute WIGA's argument. The immunity provision states in relevant part:
There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against . the association . for any action taken . in the performance of [its] powers and duties under this chapter.
This language simply states that WIGA can not be held liable for any actions it takes in accordance with its duties. The language necessarily implies that WIGA can be held liable for actions it takes which are not within its duties. It follows that if it is within WIGA's duties to reasonably settle claims, and WIGA refuses to reasonably settle a claim, such a refusal is not in accordance with WIGA's statutory duties, and therefore WIGA cannot claim immunity from liability based on that refusal."
"an unpaid claim, including one for unearned premiums, which arises out of and is within the coverage of an insurance policy to which this chapter applies issued by an insurer....
RCW 48.32.030(4). It is well established in Washington that insurers do have the duty to accept reasonable settlements. Tank v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 105 Wash.2d 381, 715 P.2d 1133, 1136-37 (1986); Murray v. Mossman, 56 Wash.2d 909, 355 P.2d 985, 987 (1960); Evans v. Continental Casualty Co., 40 Wash.2d 614, 245 P.2d 470, 478-80 (1952); Burnham v. Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., 10 Wash.2d 624, 117 P.2d 644, 648 (1944). It follows that such a duty ""arises out of and is within the coverage of an insurance policy"" within the meaning of RCW 48.32.030(4), and that WIGA has a duty to reasonably settle covered claims.
WIGA claimed at oral argument that it would undeniably have an obligation to indemnify and defend covered claims, and that it could be sued, in spite of the immunity provision, if it abdicated those obligations, but that this does not apply to the duty to reasonably settle claims. We cannot discern any meaningful distinction between these two duties and the duty to reasonably settle claims. Each of the duties ""arises out of and is within the coverage of an insurance policy"" within the terms of RCW 48.32.030(4). Any action taken by WIGA in violation of those duties is not an action taken pursuant to statutory authority, and therefore does not warrant immunity.
This conclusion is supported by the Washington Supreme Court's decision in Seattle First Nat'l Bank v. Washington Ins. Guar. Assoc., 116 Wash.2d 398, 804 P.2d 1263 (1991). There, the insured bought a novel form of insurance from an insurer that subsequently was declared insolvent. When the insured attempted to recover from WIGA, WIGA claimed that RCW 48.32 prohibited recovery for the type of insurance in question. The Washington Supreme Court disagreed, and ordered WIGA to pay for the claim, as well as some attorney fees and costs. Thus, the resolution of the Seattle First National Bank case clearly indicates that WIGA does not enjoy total immunity from suits by insureds. Interestingly, the Washington Supreme Court did not address the immunity provision in resolving that case. Thus, whatever the reach of the immunity provision of the statute, its scope did not preclude the claim asserted in Seattle First National Bank."
"WIGA attempts to distinguish Seattle First National Bank. It claims that, in that case, ""the insureds commenced the action but no claim of immunity was raised since it was a pure statutory construction."" To the extent that the sentence can be comprehended, it seems that WIGA is arguing that Seattle First National Bank is distinguishable because the issue there involved whether a certain form of insurance was, in substance, equivalent to a form of insurance for which the statute precluded coverage. It is true that the identical issue is not disputed here. However, the difference is irrelevant. Even WIGA admits that Seattle First National Bank ""involve[d] particular constructions of the Act which were determinable as a matter of law."" The same can be said of the case at bar: whether WIGA has a duty to reasonably settle is a question of law.
Seattle First National Bank is significant for another reason. There, the Washington Supreme Court held that, for the purpose of applying a contractual attorney's fees provision, the insured's suit against WIGA was based on contract. Specifically, the Washington Supreme Court stated:
[A]n action is on a contract if the action arose out of the contract and if the contract is central to the dispute. Here, the [insurance] agreements are the source of this action and central to the dispute.... We thus conclude that this is an action on the contract....
Seattle First National Bank, 804 P.2d at 1270. At the very least, this language implies that WIGA's statutory duties are derived from the contractual duties assumed by the insurer. The opinion's language concluding that ""this is an action on the contract"" also makes it likely that the insured can actually sue WIGA in contract. However, since the appellee in the case at bar specifically noted that her claim was to enforce WIGA's ""statutory obligations"", we need not address whether appellee might have also asserted a claim in contract for relief against WIGA."
"[The insured] alleges that PIGA has failed to investigate, pay, or settle, an alleged covered claim, and has failed to advise [the insured] of purported claims procedures. Taken together, however, these allegations are undeniably part of PIGA's statutory powers and duties to adjust, handle, and pay covered claims while denying all oth-ers_ To the extent that we may ultimately find that [the insured's] claims are in fact covered claims, PIGA may lose its statutory immunity to the extent that it then fails to assume, at such later date, its payment obligations in a timely manner.
Id. at 1265. We read this language as holding that PIGA is immune only from allegations of wrongdoing for claims which are not ""covered claims,"" but that PIGA has a statutory obligation to settle claims. We think that the same reasoning applies to WIGA.
WIGA also relies on three cases from other states for the proposition that guaranty associations have no duty to reasonably settle claims. WIGA first relies on Schreffler v. Pennsylvania Ins. Guar. Assoc., 402 Pa.Super. 309, 586 A2d 983 (1991). Interestingly, that case involved facts virtually identical to the facts in the case at hand. However, Schreffler supports our conclusion that WIGA has a statutory duty to accept reasonable settlements. The case states only that a ""bad faith"" claim cannot arise against PIGA. We take this to mean a common-law claim. However, Schreffler specifically states that, ""settlement is a power conferred upon PIGA under the terms of the Act."" Id. 586 A.2d at 985. Therefore, Schreffler merely states that an insured cannot sue the guaranty association in tort or contract. It makes no mention of whether the insured can sue the guaranty association for its statutory obligation of settlement."
"We hold that WIGA had no immunity for a claim to enforce its statutory duties.
C. Was the Covenant Settlement Enforceable in Light of the Fact that WIGA Did Not Breach Its Duty to Defend?
WIGA's third argument is somewhat confused. We believe that WIGA is arguing as follows: WIGA concedes that where an insurer or insurance guaranty association refuses to defend an action, the insured is free to settle the action and then seek recovery from the insurer. However, where, as here, the insurer provides a defense but merely refuses to settle the action, no action may be brought against the insurer so long as the insured faces no actual risk of loss. Because Ramsey covenanted not to enforce the judgment against the insured, WIGA claims it cannot subsequently be held hable.
In support of this argument, WIGA argues that the cap provision on the total amount of covered claims contemplates that the insured will be exposed to excess judgments. WIGA reasons from this that because the Act mandates that the cooperation provision in the policy is applicable, the drafters of the Act must have intended that the risk of the insured and the risk of the pool should be linked. Thus, the insureds may not retain their coverage after settling in such a way as to eliminate the risk of an excess judgment.
This conclusion simply does not follow from WIGA's stated premise. WIGA's brief seems to imply that the Act, by virtue of setting a $300,000 cap on awards, contemplates that the insured will be forced to bear the risk of an excess judgment in some eases. However, to the extent that insureds will sometimes need to bear the burden of excess judgments, this burden seems to be merely the result of practical exigencies, rather than the result of an intent to couple the risk of the insured with the risk of liability by the pool. As noted by WIGA in its brief, the cap on recovery by any single claimant is aimed at assuring that funds are available at an acceptable cost to guaranty at least a minimum payment to all deserving claimants. WIGA cites no authority suggesting that there is any other purpose for this provision."
"D. Could a Reasonable Jury Have Determined the Claim was Worth $200,000?
The final issue raised by WIGA is whether the superior court improperly denied its motion for a judgment not withstanding the verdict. WIGA makes two arguments in this regard. First, it argues that under Isaacson v. California Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 44 Cal.3d 775, 244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297 (1988), before awarding damages, the jury had to find that ""a judgment against the insured in excess of [CIGA's] statutory limit of liability is likely."" Isaacson, 244 Cal.Rptr. at 667, 750 P.2d at 309. Thus, in the instant ease, Ramsey would have had to show that a verdict of more than $300,000 was likely. Second, WIGA argues that no reasonable jury could have accepted Ramsey's $200,000 settlement.
As to WIGA's first argument, it is correct that the California Supreme Court formulated the test in Isaacson in this manner. However, this is not the only permissible formulation of WIGA's statutory duty. Because the insureds must demonstrate that they were harmed by the guaranty association's violation of its statutory duty, the inquiry must include consideration of the potential harm to the insured which was caused by the failure of the association to settle (i.e. an excess verdict). In the present case, the jury was instructed, ""[Wjhen making a decision about a settlement offer, WIGA is required to consider the personal financial interests of Coluccio and Mr. Ursino equally with its own financial interests."" Additionally, when considering the reasonableness of any particular settlement offer, the jury was instructed to consider ""[t]he risks and the expense of continuing the trial between Ms. Ramsey and Coluccio and Mr. Ursino"" and ""[t]he ability of Coluccio and Mr. Ursino to pay any adverse judgment."" We think that the issue of the extent of WIGA's statutory duty was sufficiently encompassed in these jury instructions."
"[t]he releasing person's damages; the merits of the releasing person's liability theory; the merits of the released person's defense theory; the released person's relative faults; the risks and expenses of continued litigation; the released person's ability to pay; any evidence of bad faith, collusion, or fraud; the extent of the releasing person's investigation and prepara tion of the ease; and the interests of the parties not being released.
Id. 658 P.2d at 1236. However, since WIGA nowhere asked this court to consider whether the Glover factors were satisfied, we do not address the issue.
As to WIGA's second argument, there is ample evidence in the record which could form the basis of a finding that the claim should have been reasonably settled for $200,000. Even if none of the witnesses had testified that the claim was worth $200,000, the jury was given sufficient details concerning the underlying events and the proceedings in the earlier trial to make its own assessment of the value of the claim. The evidence introduced included Ramsey's initial settlement brochure which estimated damages, not including punitives, at almost $250,-000. Also, the judge in the underlying case estimated that the award could be anywhere between zero and $500,000, and should probably be valued at $175,000. Additionally, the attorneys which WIGA appointed to represent Ursino and Coluceio recommended that WIGA accept Ramsey's offer to settle for $200,000. Finally, there was a good deal of evidence regarding how the trial was progressing. Based on these details a reasonable jury could find that the claim should reasonably have been settled for $200,000."

Normally when considering questions of law, we are ""not bound by the lower court's decision"" and will ""adopt the rule of law that is most persuasive in light of precedent, reason, and policy."" Gain v. Ha, 591 P.2d 1281, 1284 n. 6 (Alaska 1979). However, since we are interpreting the law of another state, we look to that state's precedent before we turn to reason and policy. We also note that the Washington Supreme Court applies de novo review to questions of statutory interpretation. Stuckey v. Department of Labor and Indus., 129 Wash.2d 289, 916 P.2d 399 (1996).
.Professor Keeton has articulated the insurer's duty to settle as follows:
With respect to the decision whether to settle or try the case, the insurance company must in good faith view the situation as it would if there were no policy limit applicable to the claim.... The insurer is negligent in failing to settle if, but only if, such ordinarily prudent insurer would consider that choosing to try the case (rather than to settle on the terms by which the claim could be settled) would be taking an unreasonable risk — that is, trial would involve chances of unfavorable results out of reasonable proportion to the chances of favorable results."

. WIGA does not assert that the claim in the case at bar is uncovered.
. A similar message is apparent in Agency Budget Corp. v. Washington Ins. Guar. Assoc., 93 Wash.2d 416, 610 P.2d 361 (1980). There, the Washington Supreme Court considered whether an amendment to RCW 48.32 applied retroactively. While the court ruled that the amendment could only be applied prospectively, the language that it used is informative. It stated that, ""the 1976 amendment created a new cause of action [for .insureds] and corresponding liability [for WIGA]."" Id. 610 P.2d at 366 (emphasis added). In our view this language contemplates that causes of action can be maintained against WIGA.
. This holding differs from California law, since the California Supreme Court held that the California Insurance Guaranty Association can be liable for failure to fulfill its statutory duties, but is immune from common law claims. Isaacson v. California Ins. Guar. Assoc., 44 Cal.3d 775, 244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 664-65, 750 P.2d 297, 306 (1988).
. Given the Washington Supreme Court's holding, it would seem that the insured could have sued WIGA on the insurance contract for a bad faith handling of the insurance claim. In Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Butler, 118 Wash.2d 383, 823 P.2d 499, 503 (1992), the court stated, ""An action for bad faith handling of an insurance claim sounds in tort."" However, the case does not imply that an insurer can be sued only in tort. Additionally, that case contains no discussion of the origin of the duty of good faith which an insurer owes to an insured. An earlier Washington Supreme Court decision does contain such a discussion. However,"
"the contract between insurer and insured . Tank, 715 P.2d at 1136 (emphasis added). Thus, while Safeco allows an insured to sue in tort, Tank recognizes that the duty of good faith arises in contract. Therefore, it seems that in Washington, an insured can sue an insurer in either tort or contract for bad faith handling of an insurance claim.
A Washington appellate court held in Vaughn v. Vaughn, 23 Wash.App. 527, 597 P.2d 932, 934 (1979), that bad faith claims sound exclusively in tort. However, the two Washington Supreme Court cases on which the Vaughn court relied provide questionable support for this proposition. First, Vaughn relied on Hamilton v. State Farm Ins. Co., 83 Wash.2d 787, 523 P.2d 193 (1974). However, that case does not seem to address the issue of whether bad faith claims sound in tort or in contract. Second, Vaughn relied on Murray, 355 P.2d at 985. However, that case does not state that tort is the exclusive field of law by which an insured can recover against an insurer. Furthermore, Murray does not contain the same sort of in-depth discussion of the issue as does Tank. Finally, we note that an early Washington Supreme Court case, Evans, 245 P.2d at 480, explicitly declined to address whether a bad faith claim could sound in contract. Therefore, we see no obstacle that would prohibit an insured from suing WIGA in contract for bad faith handling of a claim.
We note in passing that the appellate court in Vaughn also held that tort claims for bad faith handling of an insurance claim could not arise against WIGA. Interestingly, the court did not consider the immunity provision of the act, but instead reasoned that such a tort would not be a ""covered claim"" within the meaning of RCW 48.32.030(4). Vaughn, 597 P.2d at 934. In any case, Vaughn's holding concerning tort claims against WIGA does not speak to the contract claims against WIGA sanctioned by Seattle First National Bank, or to the statutory claim at issue in this case."

.See RCW 48.32.090(1) (requiring insureds to cooperate with WIGA). Coluccio's policy contained a standard cooperation provision which required the insured to cooperate in the investigation, settlement and defense of any claim.
.In its points on appeal, WIGA also challenged the failure of the superior court to include a jury instruction stating that WIGA was immune from suit, and for including several instructions setting forth the elements of Ramsey's claim. Because we have concluded that WIGA was not in fact immune from suit, it follows that WIGA's objections to the court's instructions are without merit. The other issues which WIGA raised in its points on appeal are waived, since WIGA failed to argue them in its briefs. See Wetzler v. Wetzler, 570 P.2d 741, 742-43 (Alaska 1977).
. In determining whether the superior court erred in denying a motion for directed verdict or judgment n.o.v., we must decide whether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, a reasonable jury could reach only one conclusion on the issue in controversy. Beaumaster v. Crandall, 576 P.2d 988 (Alaska 1978).
. The superior court relied on Isaacson in its decision that WIGA was not immune from, suit. As our discussion of the immunity provision makes clear, we do not rely on that case for our conclusion that WIGA is not immune.
. This fact is not necessarily probative as to the value of the claim, since, though the attorneys were appointed and paid by WIGA, they represented Ursino and Coluceio. The attorneys' advice to settle within the statutory limits might have been biased, since such a settlement would relieve their clients of any financial liability."
"MATTHEWS, Justice.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mane Airoulofski appeals a superior court decision granting summary judgment to the Municipality of Anchorage (""Municipality""). The superior court held that Airoulofski had waived his tort claims against the Municipality by failing to prosecute his case. The Municipality cross-appeals, contesting the superior court's earlier refusal to dismiss the case pursuant to Alaska Civil Rule 16.1.
II. FACTS & PROCEEDINGS
On December 20, 1986, the Anchorage Police Department arrested Mane Airoulofski twice. On both occasions, the police were mistaken. Alleging negligence, Airoulofski filed a complaint against the State, the Municipality, the Yellow Cab Company, Super 8 Motel, and assorted agents of these entities. Airoulofski filed his complaint on September 26, 1987. The case was assigned to the superior court's ""fast-track"" calendar under Civil Rule 16.1.
When contacted by claims adjustors from the State and Municipality, Airoulofski agreed to provide both defendants an unlimited extension of time to answer pending the outcome of settlement negotiations. In a letter to Airoulofski's attorney, the Municipality's adjustor stated that ""upon a request from you we will retain counsel and respond to the suit immediately."" Super 8 Motel answered the complaint in November 1987.
Airoulofski and Super 8 Motel proceeded with discovery. After Airoulofski failed to comply with an order compelling responses to Super 8's discovery requests, the superior court dismissed the complaint. Upon Airou-lofski's motion for reconsideration, the superior court vacated its order and allowed the case to continue. In February 1989, Super 8 moved for dismissal under Civil Rule 41(e), based upon Airoulofski's failure to take action in the case for sixteen months. Airou-lofski filed an opposition to Super 8's motion."
"On October 20, 1993, Airoulofski filed a Memorandum to Set Civil Case for Trial, serving the State and Municipality. The superior court declined to set the case for trial on December 10,1998, giving Airoulofski sixty days to file a valid motion to set. Airou-lofski requested answers from the remaining defendants on December 17,1993.
The State and Municipality responded by filing a motion to dismiss, arguing that Air-oulofski's delay in bringing the case to trial mandated dismissal under Rule 16.1(g). The superior court denied the motion on February 11,1994, holding:
Defendants were always at liberty to request issuance of a notice of intent to dismiss under Rule 16.1. Plaintiff was en titled to such notice prior to dismissal. Defendants are not precluded from filing a motion to dismiss on the basis of laches, if such motion can be supported by the facts of this case.
This decision forms the basis of the Municipality's cross-appeal.
The State and Municipality filed their answers on February 24,1994, and the superior court issued an order setting trial for September 26, 1994. The State moved for, and was granted, judgment in its favor on the pleadings. Default was entered against Yellow Cab and its agent on April 4, 1994.
The Municipality commenced discovery in March 1994. On July 19, 1994, the Municipality moved for summary judgment ""pursuant to the doctrines of laches, estoppel, waiver, and abandonment, based on plaintiffs six year delay in prosecuting the action."" On September 13, 1994, the superior court granted the Municipality's motion, ruling:"
"(Emphasis deleted.) Airoulofski appeals.
III. DISCUSSION
Airoulofski argues that his delay in prosecuting his claim was not direct unequivocal conduct sufficient to evidence a waiver. The Municipality contends that the superior court's February 11, 1994 refusal to dismiss Airoulofski's claim pursuant to Rule 16.1 was erroneous.
A. Superior Court's Refusal to Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute Under the Civil Rules
Alaska's Civil Rules contain two provisions by which cases may be dismissed for failure to prosecute. Rule 16.1(g) allows dismissal of dormant eases governed by the fast-track procedures of Rule 16.1. Under Rule 41(e), cases operating by standard civil procedures may be dismissed for want of prosecution. The Municipality's cross-appeal involves the interpretation of these rules; accordingly, this court exercises its own independent judgment. Ford v. Municipality of Anchorage, 813 P.2d 654, 655 (Alaska 1991).
1. Rule 16.1(g) does not allow dismissal without transfer and notice.
Rule 16.1(g) establishes the following procedures for dismissal of inactive cases on the court's fast-track calendar: The Municipality argues that despite the court system's failure to transfer the case to the inactive calendar and notify the parties of its intent to dismiss, the superior court should have dismissed Airoulofski's case under this rule. We disagree.
Where a motion to set trial and certificate have not been filed within 270 days after the service of the summons and complaint, the ease shall be transferred to the inactive calendar by the clerk of the court. The clerk shall promptly notify counsel in writing of the transfer. All cases which remain on the inactive calendar for more than 60 days shall be dismissed, unless within that period: (1) A proper motion to set trial and certificate is filed; or (2) the court on motion for good cause orders a case continued on the inactive calendar for a specified additional period of time. Notwithstanding Civil Rule 41(b), the dismissal does not operate as an adjudication upon the merits unless a previous dismissal has been entered by the court under this rule, or by the plaintiff or parties under Civil Rule 41(a)(1)."
"The plain language of Rule 16.1(g) precludes dismissal of fast-track cases without transfer to the inactive calendar and, importantly, notice to the parties. Rule 16.1(g) does not mandate dismissal of cases which are inactive for 330 days; only cases that remain inactive for sixty days following their placement upon the inactive calendar are properly dismissed. Transfer and notice to the parties are thus explicitly incorporated as prerequisites to dismissal under Rule 16.1(g).
Thus, we hold that the superior court did not err in refusing to dismiss Airoulofski's claim under Rule 16.1.
2. Rule 4.1(e) does not apply to fast-track cases.
In Ford, this court ruled that ""the language in Rule 16.1(g) and (m) provides that the rule is the exclusive means to dismiss fast-track cases."" Ford, 813 P.2d at 656. Thus, Rule 41(e) does not apply to fast-track cases. While the Municipality recognizes this, it argues that the general policies favoring the speedy resolution of disputes that underlie Rule 41(e) should be applied to this case in such a way as to allow dismissal of the claim and to make a dilatory plaintiff bear the burden of the court's oversight. However, we note that even Rule 41(e) would not allow dismissal of this claim.
Rule 41(e) provides:
Actions which have been pending in a court for more than one year without any proceedings having been taken may be dismissed as a matter of course, for want of prosecution, by the court on its own motion or on motion of a party to the action. The clerk shall review all pending cases semi-annually and in all cases in which no proceedings have been taken for more than one year, the court shall hold a call of the calendar or the clerks shall send notice to the parties to show cause in writing why the action should not be dismissed. If good cause to the contrary is not shown . within 30 days of distribution of the notice, the- court shall dismiss the action."
"Second, Rule 41(e) only allows dismissal if no proceeding has been taken in the case for a period of more than one year. This court has held that where a previously inactive party mails a request for a trial date and pre-trial conference to the court before its opponent files a motion to dismiss under Rule 41(e), the request constituted a ""proceeding"" so that dismissal was improper. Zeller v. Poor, 577 P.2d 695, 697 (Alaska 1978). Cf. Power Constructors, Inc. v. Acres American, 811 P.2d 1052, 1054 (Alaska 1991) (""A pretrial memorandum filed after the court issues its notice of dismissal does not constitute a 'proceeding' under Civil Rule 41(e)."" (emphasis added)). Here, Airoulofski made a request for a trial date before the Municipality filed its motion to dismiss the claim. Therefore, as in Zeller, by the time the Municipality filed its motion a proceeding had occurred within the prior year and dismissal would have been improper even if the case were subject to Rule 41(e).
B. Dismissal of Claims for Implied Waiver and Estoppel
The superior court granted summary judgment based upon implied waiver and estoppel. In review of summary judgment, this court must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact, and whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party and against the movant. Swenson Trucking & Excavating, Inc. v. Truckweld Equipment Co., 604 P.2d 1113, 1116 (Alaska 1980)."
"We have noted:
A waiver can be accomplished either expressly or implicitly. An implied waiver arises where the course of conduct pursued evidences an intention to waive a right, or is inconsistent with any other intention than a waiver, or where neglect to insist upon the right results in prejudice to another party. To prove an implied waiver of a legal right, there must be direct, unequivocal conduct indicating a purpose to abandon or waive the legal right, or acts amounting to an estoppel by the party whose conduct is to be construed as a waiver.
Milne v. Anderson, 576 P.2d 109, 112 (Alaska 1978) (citations omitted).
""[N]eglect to insist upon a right only results in an estoppel, or an implied waiver, when the neglect is such that it would convey a message to a reasonable person that the neglectful party would not in the future pursue the legal right in question."" Van Biene, 847 P.2d at 589. Even where neglect results in prejudice to another party, for an implied waiver to arise there must be direct, unequivocal conduct indicating a purpose to abandon the right. Milne, 576 P.2d at 112; Miscovich v. Tryck, 875 P.2d 1293, 1301 (Alaska 1994). The superior court held that Airoulofski's prolonged failure to notify the Municipality of his intent to litigate against it, while proceeding against Super 8 Motel without service of papers on the Municipality, signified a waiver according to these standards.
Under the circumstances, we believe that proceeding against one defendant while allowing others to postpone their answers pending the outcome of settlement negotiations did not give rise to a waiver. The parties had agreed to ""an unlimited extension of time"" pending settlement negotiations, with the Municipality noting that upon Airou-lofski's request it would ""retain counsel and respond to the suit immediately."" A reasonable person would not necessarily conclude that Airoulofski did not intend to prosecute his claim against the Municipality. Airoulof-ski took no actions that would constitute direct, unequivocal conduct indicating a purpose to abandon his claim against the Municipality. His silence toward the Municipality while prosecuting his claim against Super 8 could be the product of any number of factors, including mistake, negligence, or incompetence, or even of a misunderstanding as to the status of the settlement negotiations. See Van Biene, 847 P.2d at 589 (no implied waiver where conduct amounts at most to neglect or internal mistake)."
"IV. CONCLUSION
We find no merit to the Municipality's argument that the superior court should have dismissed Airoulofski's claim earlier under Rule 16.1(g), since that rule does not allow dismissal without transfer and notice. We REVERSE the superior court's grant of summary judgment to the Municipality, since we find that Airoulofski did not demonstrate conduct sufficient to waive his claim. The case is REMANDED to the superior court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
. Alaska Civil Rule 16.1 establishes special procedures designed to reduce delay in civil litigation. Cases are assigned to the fast-track calendar by administrative order of the judicial district's presiding judge.
. This order was entered before we decided Ford v. Municipality of Anchorage, 813 P.2d 654 (Alaska 1991). Under Ford, dismissal under Rule 41(e) is improper when the case has been placed under the fast-track provisions of Rule 16.1. Id. at 656.
. The Municipality also argues that the superior court's dismissal of Airoulofski's claims against Super 8 operated to dismiss Airoulofski's claim against all defendants. This argument is without merit. The superior court's order stated: ""[P]laintiff's claims against Super 8 Motel are dismissed."" This was not a dismissal of Airoulof-ski's claims against the State or Municipality. Dismissal of claims against one defendant was within the court's authority. S & B Mining Co. v. Northern Commercial Co., 813 P.2d 264, 269 (Alaska 1991).
. While we have on occasion treated equitable estoppel and waiver as separate defenses arising from delay in asserting a right, see Miscovich v. Tryck, 875 P.2d 1293, 1301-2 (Alaska 1994), we have also recognized that ""[t]he type of implied waiver created by neglect to insist upon a right is, in reality, a type of equitable estoppel."" Wausau Ins. Cos. v. Van Biene, 847 P.2d 584, 589 (Alaska 1993). In this case, the claim under either doctrine is the same: Airoulofski's delay constituted an assertion that he did not intend to prosecute the case against the Municipality, and the Municipality would be prejudiced were he allowed to contradict this assertion."
"OPINION
MATTHEWS, Justice.
Challenged in this case is an order determining that Mark Bridge, the presumptive father of Johnny Bridge, is not the biological father of Johnny.
Mark and Melody Bridge were married in December of 1990. They separated a year later. Johnny was born on January 7, 1992. Melody and Mark were divorced in December of 1993.
In May of 1992, the State initiated an investigation based on a number of complaints regarding the care which Johnny was receiving from Melody and Melody's boyfriend, Kyle Restin, Sr. On August 4, 1992, the State filed a non-emergency petition seeking the adjudication of Johnny as a child in need of aid. In October of 1992 the court appointed counsel for Mark, who was then living in Oregon. In January of 1993, Melody gave birth to a child fathered by Kyle Restin; Kyle, Jr. On March 4, 1993, the State filed an amended petition for adjudication of Johnny and Kyle, Jr., as children in need of aid. The amended petition states that the State took emergency custody of Johnny and Kyle, Jr., on March 3, 1993.
On August 2, 1993, Melody relinquished her parental rights to Johnny and Kyle, Jr., and Kyle, Sr., relinquished his parental rights to Kyle, Jr. Mark, on the same day, signed a stipulation that Johnny was a child in need of aid ""for the reason that [Mark Bridge] is unable to care for [Johnny Bridge] for the reason he is living out-of-state and the suitability of placement with him is still being investigated through the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children."" The stipulation further provided that Johnny would remain in the temporary custody of the Department of Health and Social Services ""until disposition in this matter."" Pursuant to this stipulation the superior court entered an order adjudicating Johnny to be a child in need of aid, set a disposition hearing and dates for reports from the State and Johnny's guardian ad litem."
"The testing was performed, and on February 1, 1994, the State received a copy of a letter from a physician with the Memorial Blood Center of Minneapolis which concluded that ""it is possible to establish that [Mark Bridge] cannot be the biological father of [Johnny Bridge]."" Based upon this letter, the State terminated Mark's visitation with Johnny.
Mark filed a motion ""to review disposition and case plan"" which sought the continuation of Mark's visitation with Johnny and challenged the standing of the State to deny Mark's paternity. Mark sought oral argument and ""an appropriate hearing"" on an expedited basis in connection with this motion.
The State filed a combined pleading which was both an opposition to the motion for review of the disposition order and case plan and a motion ""for finding that [Mark Bridge] is not the father of [Johnny Bridge]."" This pleading was supported by an affidavit of Philip Kaufman, the state social worker on the case, to which was attached the letter from the director of the Memorial Blood Center of Minneapolis and blood test results excluding Mark as a biological parent of Johnny.
The guardian ad litem filed an opposition to Mark's motion to review the disposition order. In addition, the guardian filed a pleading supporting the State's motion for a finding that Mark is not the father of Johnny: ""It is in the minor's best interest for the court to enter such finding.""
Mark filed a timely opposition to the State's motion. In the opposition Mark again challenged the authority of the State to deny his parenthood of Johnny. He did not, however, question the test results or ask for further proceedings to determine the question of his biological paternity. The court denied Mark's motion for review of the disposition order and case plan and granted the State's motion for a finding that Mark is not the father of Johnny. The order concluded that ""[Mark] is no longer entitled to party status in this matter."" The court added: ""The court finds proof which rebuts the presumption of paternity, i.e. blood tests. Evidence does not support [Bridge's] claim on either factual or legal grounds that he should be denominated as a 'psychological parent' or claim any other equitable rights to the child."""
"Johnny has been appropriately adjudicated as a child in need of aid. Mark stipulated to this adjudication. Further action in the case contemplated a range of possibilities, extending from adoption of Johnny by his foster family to relinquishment of custody of Johnny to Mark. For each of these possibilities a threshold determination of Mark's paternity of Johnny was an important consideration. The superior court, as the trial court of general jurisdiction in the state, AS 22.10.020(a), had jurisdiction to make this determination. Given the critical importance of the question of paternity, the State, as custodian of the child, has the authority to seek a determination of paternity when substantial questions concerning parentage are raised. See J.W.F. v. Schoolcraft, 763 P.2d 1217, 1221 (Utah App.1988), rev'd on other grounds, 799 P.2d 710 (Utah 1990) (guardian ad litem ""had a responsibility as well as a right to raise the issue of [the presumptive father's] paternity"" and a juvenile court in a ""neglected child"" proceeding had jurisdiction to decide the question of paternity). In In re Lisa R., 13 Cal.3d 636, 119 Cal.Rptr. 476, 479-80, 532 P.2d 123, 127-28, cert. denied, 421 U.S. 1014, 95 S.Ct. 2421, 44 L.Ed.2d 682 (1975), the Supreme Court of California stated:
Notwithstanding the absence of specific authorization to make particular determinations, a juvenile court is nevertheless vested with the authority to make such determinations which are incidentally necessary to the performance of those functions demanded of it by the Legislature pursuant to the Juvenile Court Law. That law is replete with references to ""parents."" In some of such instances the court is merely required to respond to allegations of parentage without first having actually to find the existence of a parent-child relationship. However, in other significant respects the law cannot be judicially applied without a determination of parentage when such question is placed in issue. Thus wardship may initially depend, in the circumstances of a particular case, on a finding that a minor has no parent or ""persistently or habitually refuses to obey the reasonable and proper orders or directions of his parents."" It is manifest that a juvenile court cannot find that a minor has no parent or that he refuses to obey a parent without a contemporaneous determination of parentage."
"On his second claim, Mark argues that he ""did not have an opportunity to present any evidence"" on the issue of paternity. In addition he argues that the blood test was not accompanied by sworn testimony that the test was a scientifically accepted one or that procedures to make the test valid were followed.
Mark's first point is without merit, for in opposing the State's motion he did not do so on the ground that he had evidence which challenged the blood test or that he wished time to have an opportunity to develop such evidence. In the absence of a preliminary demonstration of the existence of relevant disputed facts no hearing was required. Epperson v. Epperson, 835 P.2d 451, 453 (Alaska 1992). Cf. State v. Albert, 899 P.2d 103, 105 n. 2 (Alaska 1995) (""Although the rule is silent as to the circumstances under which a hearing must be held when opposition is filed, our cases generally indicate the necessity for an evidentiary hearing in any case in which there are factual disputes on material issues.""); Estate of Miner v. Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n, 635 P.2d 827, 834 (Alaska 1981) (quoting NLRB v. Bata Shoe Co., 377 F.2d 821, 826 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 917, 88 S.Ct. 238, 19 L.Ed.2d 265 (1967) (holding that ""there is no requirement, constitutionally or otherwise, that there be a hearing in the absence of substantial and material issues crucial to [the] determination"")); Alaska R. Civ. P. 56(c) (judgment for the summary judgment movant shall be rendered if the pleadings and evidentiary materials show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law)."
"For the above reasons the judgment of the superior court is AFFIRMED.
RABINOWITZ, Justice, dissenting.
MOORE, C.J., not participating.
. All names of parties used in this opinion are pseudonyms.
. He did, however, request a hearing concerning various legal theories:
A hearing is required to determine which legal standard the court should first apply to reach a just and fair result in this matter; shouldn't this court still consider Mr. [Bridge] a parent, based on the presumption of the legitimacy of children born in to a marriage? Even if not, serious questions of fact exist as to the Best Interests of [Johnny] as [Mark Bridge] retains legitimate residual parental rights, such, for example, the right to have his son retain the [Bridge] name or the right of a presumptive father to claim a child bom of a legitimate marriage as his son, as there is no other parent asserting a contrary or superior right to this child.
. For example, under the child in need of aid statute, the court is authorized to find a child in need of aid based on parental conduct, and to terminate parental rights based on parental conduct. AS 47.10.010(a)(2); AS 47.10.080(c)(3). A threshold question in such cases may be whether a person claiming the rights of a parent is a parent. Under Rule 2(1) of the Child in Need of Aid Rules, ""parent"" means a biological or adoptive parent.
. There is a presumption, rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence, that Mark is Johnny's father. Smith v. Smith, 845 P.2d 1090, 1092 (Alaska 1993). The effect of this presumption was to shift to the State the burden of going forward with the presentation of evidence. Evidence Rule 3 01 (a). This duplicates the burden that was already imposed on the State as the party moving for relief in the nature of summary judgment. As such, the presumption does not prevent such relief from being entered if, in consideration of all the evidence including the basic fact giving rise to the presumption — Mark's marriage to Melody at the time of Johnny's birth — it could not be reasonably concluded that Mark was Johnny's father. On this record a conclusion that Mark was Johnny's father would be unreasonable. The fact that the presumption is rebut-table only by clear and convincing evidence does not change this conclusion. If there were any evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the question whether Mark was Johnny's father, such evidence would suffice to prevent relief in the nature of summary judgment regardless of the standard of proof to be used at trial. See Moffatt v. Brown, 751 P.2d 939, 943 (Alaska 1988) (""We decline to incorporate the applicable substantive evidentiary standard into this state's summary judgment practice."")."
"OPINION
MATTHEWS, Justice.
Alaska Statute 13.31.070 validated provisions transferring at death property contained in certain instruments which do not qualify as wills. The question here is whether joint tenancy designations on stock certificates are covered by AS 13.31.070. We an swer in the affirmative, because the literal requirements of the statute are met, and the result is consistent with state policy as reflected in a subsequent amendment to the statute, which clearly includes stock certificates.
I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
Anthony M. Evanco (decedent) died on March 13, 1992. His will directed that his sizable estate be divided equally among his surviving brothers and sisters. The will also nominated the decedent's brother, Eugene J. Evancoe (personal representative), as the personal representative of the estate.
At the time of his death, the decedent owned and was in possession of a substantial number of stock certificates and some certificates of deposit. On their face, these certificates named both the decedent and another person as owners, designating them as ""joint tenants,"" ""joint tenants with rights of surviv-orship,"" or with other similar designations. The superior court found that the decedent intended to retain control and ownership of the stock certificates and the certificates of deposit during his lifetime, but to have ownership pass to the named joint tenants automatically and outside of probate upon his death. Neither party contests this finding on this appeal.
Shortly after assuming his duties, the personal representative delivered each of the stock certificates and certificates of deposit to the persons designated ""joint tenants"" on the certificates."
"The superior court concluded that the personal representative's ""distribution of the joint tenancy stocks directly to the named joint tenants was consistent with the provisions of AS 13.81.070 and was valid under Alaska law."" It further concluded that ""Eugene J. Evancoe should not be removed as the personal representative of the estate of Anthony M. Evanco, and the removal petition should be dismissed with prejudice.""
The guardian appeals this decision.
II. DISCUSSION
The question that we must decide on this appeal is whether the superior court was correct in its conclusion that
Eugene J. Evaneoe's distribution of the joint tenancy stocks directly to the named joint tenants was consistent with the provisions of AS 13.31.070 and was valid under Alaska law.[ ]
Generally, a decedent's directions concerning disposition of his property are invalid unless they are contained in a will. However, at the time of Anthony Evanco's death, Alaska had adopted a ""validating statute,"" which declares certain will substitutes to be nontestamentary and thereby not subject to the formal requirements of a will. AS 13.31.070 (current version at AS 13.33.101). This statute provided in pertinent part:
(a) Any of the following provisions in an insurance policy, contract of employment, bond, mortgage, promissory note, deposit agreement, pension plan, trust agreement, conveyance or any other written instrument effective as a contract, gift, conveyance, or trust is considered to be nontesta-mentary, and AS 13.06 — AS 13.36 does not invalidate the instrument or any provision that"
"(3) any property which is the subject of the instrument shall pass to a person designated by the decedent in either the instrument or a separate writing, including a will, executed at the same time as the instrument or subsequently.[ ]
Initially, we must decide whether AS 13.31.070 applies to this case. The guardian argues that the statute should not apply because: (1) ""[The statute] does not currently validate POD [payable on death] stocks and mutual fund shares""; and (2) the residual clause in the statute should not be interpreted to encompass stocks, because stock certificates were ""widely used"" at the time of the statute's drafting, and the residual clause is ""logically viewed as a protective device aimed at those incipient instruments that the enumerated portion fails to cite.""
We find the guardian's argument unpersuasive. A share of corporate stock evidenced by a stock certificate can fairly be regarded as a ""written instrument effective as a contract."" See AS 13.31.070(a). Further, we can think of no policy reasons for excluding stock certificates from that category. Additionally, effective January 1, 1997, AS 13.31.070 was superseded by a substantially similar provision, AS 13.33.101, which clearly encompasses stock certificates. When an ambiguous statute that we have not construed and an unambiguous successor statute can reasonably be interpreted in a consistent manner, the policy embodied in the successor statute is a factor that is appropriately considered in interpreting the old statute. For these reasons, we conclude that AS 13.31.070 applies to stock certificates."
"In addition, the requirement that the instrument be ""effective as a contract, gift, conveyance, or trust"" is satisfied. See AS 13.31.070(a). As previously stated, a share of stock may properly be regarded as a contract between a shareholder and his corporation. The joint tenancy designation can appropriately be characterized as a provision naming a third-party beneficiary. See Corbin on Contracts § 783 (1951). Thus, the joint tenancy designations on the stock certificates were ""effective as a contract.""
In conclusion, the validating statute applies and requires that an otherwise valid provision in a stock certificate be regarded as nontestamentary. Consequently, we hold that the joint tenancy designations on the stock certificates in this case are valid and effective will substitutes.
AFFIRMED.
. The guardian also contends that the superior court erred in concluding that the certificates of deposit could be distributed to the named joint tenants. However, at the time of Anthony's death, AS 13.31.020(a) (current version at AS 13.33.212(a)) provided in relevant part that ""[sjums remaining on deposit at the death of a party to a joint account belong to the surviving party or parties as against the estate of the decedent unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intention at the time the account is created."" A bank certificate of deposit designating a joint tenant is a ""joint account."" See AS 13.31.005(1) (current version at AS 13.33.201(1)); AS 13.31.005(4) (repealed, § 18 ch. 75 SLA 1996). In addition, AS 13.31.030 (current version at AS 13.33.214) provided that ""[a]ny transfers resulting from the application of AS 13.31.020 . are not to be considered as testamentary."" Therefore, we reject this contention."
". Under common law the attempted transfer in this case of stock certificates would be invalid. The parties agree that the joint tenancy designations did not operate as a valid inter vivos trans fer or irrevocable assignment, because the decedent intended to retain control and ownership of the stock certificates during his lifetime, and because there was no delivery. See Neuschafer v. McHale, 76 Or.App. 360, 709 P.2d 734, 738-39 (1985) (holding that where the court determined that the decedent's intention was to ""avoid probate,"" placing shares of stock in joint tenancy with rights of survivorship was not a valid inter vivos gift, and was testamentary and void); see also Uniform Probate Code § 6-201, Official Comment (1983) (stating that provisions in a promissory note to pay to another named person if the payee dies are invalidated by most states for noncompliance with the statute of wills). Consequently, the purported transfer would be treated as testamentary. Because the purported transfer does not comply with the formalities in the statute of wills, it would be invalid, and the stocks would pass according to the provisions of the will. See AS 13.11.155 (current version at AS 13.12.502) (requiring, among other things, signatures of two people who witnessed the testator sign or acknowledge the signature on the will).
. We will refer to this statute as the ""validating statute.""
. We have previously noted that ""[t]he relationship between a corporation and its shareholders is primarily contractual."" Hanson v. Kake Tribal Corp., 939 P.2d 1320, 1325 (Alaska 1997)."
"(a) A provision for a nonprobate transfer on death in an insurance policy, contract of employment, bond, mortgage, promissory note, certificated or uncertificated security, account agreement, custodial agreement, deposit agreement, compensation plan, pension plan, individual retirement plan, employee benefit plan, trust, conveyance, deed of gift, marital property agreement, or other written instrument of a similar nature is nontestamentary. This subsection includes a written provision that (1) money or other benefits- due to, controlled by, or owned by a decedent before death must be paid after the decedent's death to a person whom the decedent designates either in the instrument or in a separate writing, including a will, executed either before or at the same time as the instrument, or later; . [or]
(3) property controlled by or owned by the decedent before death that is the subject of the instrument passes to a person the decedent designates either in the instrument or in a separate writing, including a will, executed either before or at the same time as the instrument, or later. (Emphasis added.) Shares of a corporation's stock evidenced by stock certificates clearly are ""certificated securities,"" and therefore are among the specifically enumerated instruments in the current statute.
. Cf. Hansen v. Stroecker, 699 P.2d 871, 874-75 (Alaska 1985) (stating that where we had never ruled on question of whether to adopt ""wait-and-see"" approach as common law rule, and where legislature had enacted a prospective statute embodying ""wait-and-see"" approach, we were influenced by the statute in determining common law rule applicable to suit filed prior to the effective date of the statute)."
"Alaska Criminal Rule 45(e)(1) currently provides that, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, the time within which a defendant must be tried begins to run from the date the ""charging document"" is served upon the defendant. This case raises the question of whether an ""Order and Conditions of Release"" form issued by a magistrate following an arrestee's initial appearance under Criminal Rule 5(a)(1) is a ""charging document"" for purposes of Rule 45(e)(1), triggering the time period for bringing the arrestee to trial. We hold that it is not.
On July 3, 1996, Kelly G. Bailey was arrested and taken before a magistrate pursuant to Criminal Rule 5(a)(1). The magistrate ordered Bailey to be held in lieu of $2500 bail. The magistrate then signed an ""Order and Conditions of Release"" form that was captioned ""State of Alaska vs. Kelley [sic] Bailey."" This form bore the case number ""96-5035 Cr,"" and it referred to the ""charges"" against Bailey as third-degree assault, driving while intoxicated, and resisting arrest.
However, the State of Alaska never brought these or any other charges against Bailey. When Bailey appeared in court on July 24 (as she had been directed to do upon her release), no charges had been filed, and Bailey was discharged. When she left court on July 24, Bailey had never been served with any criminal complaint, indictment, information, or citation.
Six weeks later, on September 9, 1996, the Municipality of Anchorage filed a criminal complaint against Bailey under a new case number, 3AN-M96-7101 Cr. This complaint charged Bailey with the municipal offenses of driving while intoxicated and resisting an officer. AMC § 09.28.020(A); AMC § 08.05.530(A)."
"In this appeal, Bailey argues that the bail release form she received from the magistrate at her initial appearance constituted a ""charging document"" for purposes of Rule 45(c)(1). Bailey contends that the bail release form was a ""charging document"" because the form notified her that the State of Alaska was bringing a criminal case against her and that she was charged with various offenses under state law.
Criminal Rule 45(c)(1) currently provides, in pertinent part, that ""the time for trial shall begin running, without demand by the defendant, from the date the charging document is served upon the defendant."" This is a significant change from the pre-1993 version of the rule. Under the former version of the rule, the time for bringing a defendant to trial generally began to run ""[f]rom the date the defendant [was] arrested, initially arraigned, or from the date the charge (complaint, indictment, or information) [was] served upon the defendant, whichever [was] first.""
In her ruling, Judge Nolan wrote that ""it appears that the rule was amended [in 1993] specifically to eliminate an arrest as the trig gering event for commencement of the rule."" Judge Nolan's conclusion is firmly supported by memoranda of the Supreme Court's Standing Committee on the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the body that proposed the 1993 amendment to the court. The Criminal Rules Committee proposed that Rule 45(c) be amended so that the time for bringing a defendant to trial would no longer begin running from the date of the arrest, but would instead begin to run from the date the defendant was held to answer to a charge."
"Bailey's argument is premised on an interpretation of Rule 45(c)(1) that is inconsistent with the legislative history of the 1993 amendment. Under the pre-1993 version of Rule 45(c), a formal arrest and a consequent appearance before a magistrate would have triggered the running of the time for trial, even though the arrest was not followed up with criminal charges. See Knowlton v. State, 795 P.2d 1287, 1288 (Alaska App.1990). But documents generated by the Criminal Rules Committee show that one of the Committee's purposes in proposing the 1993 amendment was to ensure that such an arrest and initial appearance should no longer trigger the running of Rule 45.
In a memorandum dated April 6, 1992, Committee member Cynthia M. Hora told the Committee that Rule 45(c) should be amended to avoid having the time for trial commence when a person is ""arrested and held to answer [through] the action[s] of the police and [a] magistrate,"" if ""the prosecutor later conelude[s] that there [is] insufficient evidence to file a charge and eause[s] the outright release of the defendant."" (According to Hora's memorandum, this same result — the non-triggering of Rule 45 — should apply even if the government at some later time decides to formally charge the person ""with the same offense for which he or she was arrested."") (Quoting II Standards for Criminal Justice, § 12-2.2 and 20-21 (1986).)
To ensure that Rule 45 would not be triggered by the ""aetion[s] of the police and magistrate"" when the prosecuting authority subsequently declines to file charges, Hora proposed that Rule 45(c)(1) no longer refer to a person's arrest."
"MANNHEIMER, Judge.
This appeal requires us to decide whether the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, or ""HGN"" test, satisfies the standard for admissibility of scientific evidence established in Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923), and reaffirmed as the governing standard in Alaska in Contreras v. State, 718 P.2d 129, 134-36 (Alaska 1986)."
"As we explain in more detail below, we conclude that the horizontal gaze nystagmus test is premised on generally accepted scientific theory. Although there is genuine dispute as to whether a person's precise level of intoxication or precise blood-alcohol level can be ascertained by his or her performance on the HGN test, there is no dispute that alcohol consumption causes observable nystag-mus. We conclude that, if a person demonstrates nystagmus during the HGN test, this is a reasonable indication that the person may have consumed alcohol and is potentially intoxicated. Therefore, with certain qualifications explained below, we hold that evidence of a person's performance on the HGN test is admissible under the Fry e-Contreras rule.
How This Case Arose
In the early morning of March 1, 1994, Alaska State Trooper Lee Robert Oly was patrolling the Glenn Highway, accompanied by his supervisor, Trooper Oscar Siegfried. Oly observed an oncoming Toyota pull off to the other side of the highway. Intending to check on the welfare of the Toyota's driver, Oly turned his patrol car around and pulled up behind the stopped Toyota. Ballard, who was driving the Toyota, got out of his vehicle. Ballard had to steady himself against the Toyota, and he staggered as he walked toward Oly. When Ballard stopped walking, he continued to have difficulty maintaining his balance; he swayed from side to side. Oly smelled the odor of alcoholic beverages on Ballard's breath, and he saw that Ballard appeared to have difficulty focusing his eyes (which were bloodshot). Based on these observations, Oly decided to administer field sobriety tests to Ballard."
"Ballard's Pre-Trial Objection to the HGN Evidence and the Testimony Presented at the Frye Hearing
Before trial, Ballard asked the district court to exclude all evidence of his performance on the HGN test, contending that the HGN test did not meet the Frye standard for admissibility. District Court Judge Natalie K. Finn conducted an extensive hearing into the scientific foundations of the HGN test, as well as its reliability and validity.
At this hearing, the State presented an instructional videotape produced by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), demonstrating its recommended procedure for administering a three-part HGN test. The State also called Trooper Tim Schoenberg, who demonstrated the three parts of the test in the courtroom: asking the subject to track a moving object, asking him to focus on the object at the limits of his peripheral vision, and asking him to focus on the object at an angle of 45 degrees from the center of his field of vision. Schoenberg not only described how the HGN test is to be administered, but he also described how the HGN test is taught to officers.
Trooper Oly, the officer who arrested Ballard, then testified concerning his own training in the three-part HGN test. Oly told the court that his training included administering the HGN test to nineteen test subjects. Like Schoenberg, Oly demonstrated the three portions of the HGN test on a volunteer in the courtroom.
(One of Ballard's expert witnesses, Dr. Ronald Nowaczyk, later critiqued Oly's performance. Nowaczyk noted that Oly had performed the three portions of the HGN test on one of the subject's eyes, then had performed the three portions of the test on the subject's other eye; the NHTSA recommends performing each portion of the test on each eye before moving to the next portion of the test. However, Dr. Nowaczyk did not suggest that this variation would affect the test results.)"
"Burns testified that, within the scientific community, it was well-accepted that alcohol intoxication causes nystagmus. Nystagmus is not, however, an unerring indicator of alcohol intoxication; it can also be caused by other drugs, by brain trauma, or by certain diseases. Moreover, approximately half of the population will exhibit an eyeball tremor when fixing their eyes on an object at the limit of their peripheral vision. For this reason, of the three parts of the HGN test conducted on Ballard, checking for nystag-mus at maximum deviation of the eyes was the least informative. Burns conceded that only ""distinct nystagmus"" during this portion of the test would be a meaningful indicator of intoxication.
Although Burns declared that the HGN test is a ""highly sensitive"" measure of whether a person is intoxicated, she also stated that the HGN test was never designed to be used alone, but rather in conjunction with other field sobriety tests such as the walk- and-turn test and the one-leg-stand test. Burns added, however, that among such a battery of tests, the HGN test has distinctive value because nystagmus is an involuntary response. An alcoholic can learn to control or compensate for the effects of intoxication on balance, physical agility, and verbal acuity, but it is all but impossible to disguise nystagmus.
Burns told the district court that, for purposes of assessing the reliability and validity of the HGN test, the relevant community of researchers and practitioners consisted of scientists concerned with alcohol and drug research, scientists concerned with traffic safety, and law enforcement professionals. Among this community, Burns testified, the battery of three field sobriety tests that includes walk-and-turn, one-leg-stand, and HGN is generally accepted as an accurate indicator of a person's intoxication."
"Smith conceded that alcohol-produced nys-tagmus is observable by police officers in the field, but he strenuously questioned whether precise observations of nystagmus could be made outside of a controlled laboratory setting. In particular, Smith asserted that it is ""impossible"" for a police officer conducting a traffic stop to detect whether a driver's eyes are smoothly pursuing a moving object. Smith pointed out that the lighting at the scene of a traffic stop can be inadequate to observe the subject's eyes. He also pointed out that, if the driver is balancing unsteadily, the driver's eyes may not move smoothly when tracking an object because the driver's head is itself moving. Smith also pointed out the possibilities that the officer may not move the target object smoothly, or that the driver is myopic and therefore not able to see the object clearly. Smith told the court that he had ridden along with police officers some ten to twelve times, and he had observed that the HGN test was very difficult to perform during a roadside traffic stop.
Smith also testified that, even when nys-tagmus is visible, it is quite difficult to determine whether the angle of onset is less than 45 degrees unless one is armed with a protractor. Smith, like Burns, testified that the occurrence of nystagmus at maximum deviation is not a good indicator of intoxication because some 50 to 60 percent of the normal population displays such nystagmus. However, on cross-examination by the court, Smith admitted that the nystagmus manifested by half the population at the edges of their vision was a ""tiny"" nystagmus, readily distinguishable from the ""distinct"" nystag-mus that occurs in people who have blood-alcohol levels exceeding .10 percent."
"Turning to the validity of the HGN test (that is, the likelihood that the test accurately measures intoxication or non-intoxication), Nowaczyk told the court that he could not come to a statistical conclusion based on the data available to him. However, he believed that the HGN test ""tend[s] to overestimate"" people's levels of blood alcohol. Nowaczyk referred the court to a field study of the HGN test which showed that significant numbers of drivers failed the HGN test even though their blood-alcohol levels were below .10 percent. According to Nowaczyk, this field study showed that 15 percent of drivers with blood-alcohol levels of .00 to .04 percent failed the HGN test. Among drivers with blood-alcohol levels of .05 to .09, 64 percent failed the HGN test. However, among drivers with blood-alcohol levels of .10 to .15, the percentage failing the HGN'test rose to 95. Under cross-examination, Nowaczyk admitted that the HGN test appeared to be quite accurate in confirming the intoxication of people whose blood-alcohol level is .10 percent or higher.
After considering this testimony and reviewing the exhibits, Judge Finn ruled that the horizontal gaze nystagmus test met the Frye standard for admission of scientific evidence. The judge concluded that the scientific community accepted the connection between the appearance of nystagmus and the consumption of alcoholic beverages. While Judge Finn acknowledged that the HGN test might not be reliable enough to satisfy the standards for tests employed to make medical diagnoses, she concluded that the HGN test was a sufficiently reliable indicator of intoxication to be introduced in conjunction with the results of other field sobriety tests to establish whether a driver was under the influence. Responding to Ballard's further objections that Trooper Oly might not have administered the HGN tests in the approved manner, Judge Finn ruled that such questions were properly left to the jury."
"Trial Testimony Concerning Ballard's Performance on the HGN Test and the Various Other Field Sobriety Tests
At trial, Trooper Oly described how he administered the three parts of the HGN test to Ballard. Holding a pen about six inches in front of Ballard's face, Oly moved the pen to the left and then to the right, watching Ballard's eyes for ""smooth pursuit"" of the moving pen. Oly next held the pen all the way to the left, then all the way to the right, to see whether Ballard's eyes exhibited involuntary jerking when he looked at the pen at the extremes of his vision. Finally, Oly brought the pen to approximately a 45-degree angle from the center of Ballard's face, to see if Ballard's eyes jerked while looking at the pen at that angle.
Oly testified that Ballard's performance on the HGN test was among the worst of all the people Oly had tested. According to Oly, Ballard's eyes jerked during all three stages of the test. Oly told the jury that Ballard's performance on the test was ""dramatically different"" from what one would expect from a sober person — that Ballard's performance indicated that he was ""a very impaired individual"".
Oly also described the balance and agility tests he had administered to Ballard. In one of these tests, Oly had Ballard stand on one leg. According to Oly, Ballard did ""very poorly"" on this test: to maintain his balance, Ballard was forced to spread his arms and either put the other foot down or hop onto the other foot. Again, Oly characterized Ballard's performance on this test as characteristic of a ""very impaired person"". Ballard also failed the walk-and-turn test: he wobbled and lost his balance while standing, walking, and turning."
"Based on Ballard's performance on all these field sobriety tests, as well as Oly's observations of Ballard's eyes, breath, and movements when he first got out of the Toyota, Oly concluded that there was ""absolutely no doubt"" that Ballard was intoxicated (as opposed to simply being tired and having consumed one or two drinks). Oly then arrested Ballard for driving while intoxicated.
Trooper Oscar Siegfried, who was riding as Oly's supervisor and who observed this entire encounter, confirmed that Ballard was swaying while standing and walking, that Ballard failed the walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests, that Ballard appeared highly intoxicated, and that there was a strong odor of alcoholic beverages on Ballard's breath, an odor that was obvious once Ballard was placed in the patrol car. Siegfried testified that it was ""not a close call"" as to whether Ballard was intoxicated. Siegfried did not mention the HGN test during his testimony.
Ballard took the stand and testified that he had not been intoxicated. He said that he had consumed three drinks the evening before, then had gone to sleep for approximately seven hours. Ballard said that he was still drowsy from this lengthy sleep when the troopers stopped him. Ballard also testified that his balance was normally not that good and that his eyes sometimes had trouble tracking moving objects.
The State introduced no Intoximeter evidence; Ballard was prosecuted under AS 28.35.030(a)(1), which prohibits driving ""while under the influence of intoxicating liquor""."
"Ballard's attorney mentioned the HGN test once during his summation as well, arguing that it was inconsistent for Trooper Oly to claim that Ballard had been unsteady on his feet and yet able to hold his head steady during the HGN test. The defense attorney also made a general remark that could have been interpreted to include the HGN test along with the other field sobriety tests: ""[WJhat should . be clear to you from hearing how these different tests work is [that], although they may in certain circumstances identify those people who are under the influence of alcohol or impaired by alcohol, . these tests [also] have the potential for identifying those people who don't perform well under pressure."" Other than these quoted excerpts, the two attorneys did not emphasize or even mention the HGN test to the jury during summation.
The jury convicted Ballard of driving while intoxicated. He now appeals, contending that the State should not have been permitted to introduce evidence of his performance on the HGN test.
HGN Evidence Satisfies the Frye Test
Under the Frye test (which sets the minimum standard for admissibility of scien- tifie evidence in Alaska), the proponent of scientific evidence is required to demonstrate that the evidence rests on generally accepted scientific principles or discoveries. Contreras, 718 P.2d at 134 (citing Frye, 293 F. at 1014). Ballard argues that the scientific theory underlying the HGN test is not generally accepted in the scientific community, and thus HGN evidence does not satisfy the Frye test."
"Further, there appears to be scientific agreement that the more alcohol in a person's blood, the more likely the person is to exhibit observable nystagmus. For example, in one study cited by Ballard's expert, Dr. Nowaczyk, the HGN test was administered to drivers with a wide range of blood-alcohol levels: 15 percent of drivers with blood-alcohol levels of .00 to .04 percent failed the HGN test; 64 percent of drivers with blood-alcohol levels of .05 to .09 percent failed the test; and 95 percent of drivers with blood-alcohol levels of .10 to .15 percent failed the HGN test.
In the last decade, numerous state courts have addressed the question of whether HGN evidence meets the Frye standard. Of the courts that have resolved this issue, most have held that HGN evidence does not satisfy Frye if the HGN test results are introduced to establish that the person tested had a particular level of blood alcohol. However, these same courts hold that HGN evidence satisfies Frye if the HGN test results are admitted for the more modest purpose of indicating that the person has consumed alcohol and is potentially under the influence. See Whitson v. State, 314 Ark. 458, 863 5.W.2d 794, 797-98 (1993); State ex rel. Hamilton v. City Court of City of Mesa, 165 Ariz. 514, 799 P.2d 855, 857-58 (1990); State v. Superior Court, 149 Ariz. 269, 718 P.2d 171, 181-82 (1986); People v. Joehnk, 35 Cal.App.4th 1488, 42 Cal.Rptr.2d 6, 15-17 (1995); Hawkins v. State, 223 Ga.App. 34, 476 S.E.2d 803, 808-09 (1996); State v. Garrett, 119 Idaho 878, 811 P.2d 488, 491 (1991); People v. Buening, 229 Ill.App.3d 538, 170 Ill.Dec. 542, 547-48, 592 N.E.2d 1222, 1227-28 (1992) ; People v. Wiebler, 266 Ill.App.3d 336, 203 Ill.Dec. 597, 600, 640 N.E.2d 24, 27 (1994); State v. Armstrong, 561 So.2d 883, 887 (La.App.1990); State v. Taylor, 694 A.2d 907, 911-12 (Me.1997); Schultz v. State, 106 Md.App. 145, 664 A.2d 60, 69-70, 74, 75-77 (1995); People v. Berger, 217 Mich.App. 213, 551 N.W.2d 421, 423-24 (1996) (per curiam); City of Fargo v. McLaughlin, 512 N.W.2d 700, 707-08 (N.D.1994); State v. O'Key, 321 Or. 285, 899 P.2d 663, 689-690 (1995) ; State v. Sullivan, 310 S.C. 311, 426 S.E.2d 766, 769 (1993); Emerson v. State, 880 S.W.2d 759, 769 (Tex.Crim.App.1994); Richardson v. State, 766 S.W.2d 538, 540 (Tex.App.1989)."
"From our examination of the record in this case, as well as our examination of the lengthy discussions of the scientific research and literature concerning HGN that is contained in such decisions as State v. O'Key, Schultz v. State, and State v. Superior Court, supra, we conclude that the science underlying the HGN test — and, in particular, the principle that alcohol consumption causes nystagmus — is generally accepted within the relevant scientific community. Moreover, there is general agreement that a properly trained police officer (or other trained lay person) can observe nystagmus under field conditions. While there is considerable debate about the power of the HGN test to disclose or predict a person's precise level of blood alcohol, there is widespread agreement that horizontal nystagmus is a reliable and valid indicator of the presence of alcohol in a person's blood and, consequently, of the person's potential intoxication.
Ballard contends that HGN testing is not a ""reliable"" indicator of intoxication — that is, the test does not yield sufficiently uniform results. He points to the testimony of Dr. Nowaczyk, who quoted a study indicating that HGN testing is reliable only 59 to 66 percent of the time. Other studies have shown much higher reliability for the HGN test; these studies suggest that the three-test battery recommended by the NHTSA (HGN, walk-and-turn, one-leg-stand) is the most accurate field technique for gauging whether a person is under the influence. See Schultz, 664 A.2d at 73 n. 12. In our view, the difference among the studies is not significant."
"Ballard also argues that HGN testing is not a ""valid"" indicator of intoxication — that is, the test does not yield sufficiently accurate evidence of intoxication. He relies on studies showing that many people fail the HGN test even though their blood-alcohol levels are lower than .10 percent. Ballard asserts that the validity of the HGN test is undermined by these ""false positives"". But Ballard's argument (and most of the studies he cites to support it) are premised on the assumption that, if the HGN test is a valid indicator of intoxication, then a person whose blood-alcohol level is lower than .10 percent should pass the test. This premise is mistaken.
Alaska law forbids a person from driving while he or she is under the influence of alcohol — when the person's ability to control a motor vehicle is impaired. AS 28.35.030(a)(1). While the law also forbids people from driving when their blood-alcohol level is .10 percent or higher, see AS 28.35.030(a)(2), people can be ""under the influence"" for purposes of 030(a)(1) even when their blood-alcohol level is less than .10 percent. Thus, when a person with a blood-alcohol level of less than .10 percent fails the HGN test, this does not necessarily mean that the HGN test has falsely identified that person as being under the influence of alcohol.
Moreover, as all of the expert witnesses pointed out, nystagmus is caused by substances other than alcohol, as well as by various disorders and diseases. The fact that a sober person fails the HGN test does not mean that the tester mistakenly identified nystagmus when there was none. It could also mean that the person exhibited nystagmus, but the nystagmus occurred for reasons unrelated to alcohol consumption. In this respect, the HGN test is no different from the other field sobriety tests that measure coordination, balance, or verbal responses: people can fail these tests for reasons other than intoxication."
"For these reasons, we conclude that HGN evidence meets the Frye standard for admission of scientific evidence if the test results are admitted for the limited purpose of establishing that a person has consumed alcohol and is therefore potentially impaired. While HGN testing may not, of itself, be sufficient to establish intoxication, HGN test results are admissible as a factor to be considered by the fact-finder when determining intoxication. Testimony concerning a defendant's performance on a properly administered HGN test is admissible on the issue of impairment, provided that the prosecution claims no greater reliability or weight for the HGN evidence than it does for evidence of the defendant's performance on any of the other standard field sobriety tests, and provided further that the prosecution makes no attempt to correlate the HGN test result with any particular blood-alcohol level, range of blood-alcohol levels, or level of impairment.
The Foundational Requirements for Introducing HGN Evidence
Although we have ruled that HGN evidence (offered for the limited purposes described above) satisfies the Frye standard, another question of evidence law remains. Ballard questions whether Trooper Oly was qualified to testify concerning Ballard's performance on the HGN test.
The fact that particular scientific evidence meets the Frye standard means only that this evidence is a proper subject for testimony. Schultz, 664 A.2d at 70-71, 75-76. The party offering such evidence must still present a witness who is qualified to testify on this subject. In particular, under Alaska Evidence Rule 702, whenever a party intends to offer evidence concerning any ""scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge"", the party must establish that the witness who will offer this evidence possesses the ""knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education"" to offer an informed opinion on the subject."
"We adopt the same rule. Further, we find that the State met this foundational requirement in Ballard's case. At the pre-trial hearing, the State presented extensive evidence concerning the proper administration and assessment of the HGN test: the State played a videotape produced by the NHTSA that demonstrated the proper administration of the test, and the State offered the testimony of Trooper Schoenberg, an HGN test instructor, who demonstrated the test in the courtroom and explained how the test results are scored. Trooper Oly, the officer who arrested Ballard, then testified regarding how he had been trained to administer and assess the HGN test, and he too demonstrated the three portions of the test on a volunteer in the courtroom.
As noted above, Ballard presented only one criticism of Oly's in-court demonstration of the test: Oly had performed all three portions of the test on one eye before moving to the other eye, while the NHTSA recommends alternating eyes. However, Ballard gave the court no reason to believe that this variation could be expected to make any difference in the test results. On this record, Judge Finn could properly conclude that Trooper Oly had received adequate training in the administration of the HGN test and that Oly was therefore qualified to testify about the results of Ballard's HGN test.
We recognize that Ballard potentially had another foundational attack on the State's HGN evidence. Ballard could argue that Trooper Oly failed to substantially comply with proper testing procedures when he administered the test to Ballard. Compare Williams v. State, 884 P.2d 167, 174 (Alaska App.1994) (holding that ""substantial compliance"" with Intoximeter procedures is required to establish the foundation for admitting breath test evidence)."
"On appeal, Ballard argues that proper testing procedure is a foundational matter— something that the State must prove before HGN evidence can be admitted. Quoting People v. Leahy, 8 Cal.4th 587, 34 Cal.Rptr.2d 663, 667, 882 P.2d 321, 325 (1994), he argues that the proponent of scientific evidence ""must demonstrate that correct scientific procedures were used in the particular ease"". Ballard then faults Judge Finn for failing to decide whether Oly properly administered the HGN test to him.
Even assuming that a substantial variance from accepted testing norms could render HGN evidence inadmissible, Ballard presented no evidence of such a substantial variance at the pre-trial hearing. It must be remem bered that the primary purpose of that pretrial hearing was to determine whether HGN evidence met the Frye standard for admissibility. Even if Judge Finn ruled that HGN satisfied the Frye test, Ballard would still have another opportunity (at his trial) to attack the particular procedures that the trooper employed when administering the test to him.
This is seemingly the reason why the evidence presented at the pre-trial hearing centered on the scientific basis for the HGN test and the approved methods for administering the test, and not on the particular procedures Oly employed when administering the test to Ballard. Ballard's attorney did cross-examine Oly to a limited extent about the trooper's administration of the HGN test to Ballard (the procedures he used and the observations he made), but this cross-examination occupies only 7 pages of transcript out of a total of 420 pages."
"Ballard does not contend on appeal that Trooper Oly's testimony reveals any significant non-compliance with established testing procedures. We recognize that a trial court retains the discretion to exclude HGN test results if the test procedures were so substandard as to preclude any reasonable juror from concluding that the results were meaningful. However, our review of the record in Ballard's case reveals that any such foundational objection would have been meritless: there was clearly sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the HGN test had been administered in a manner likely to yield relevant results.
The Trooper's Assessment that Ballard's HGN Test Results Showed that He Was 'Very Impaired""
Thus far, we have concluded that a properly qualified law enforcement officer can testify concerning the administration .of the HGN test and then give an assessment of a defendant's test results — including an explanation that the presence of nystagmus is an indication that the defendant had been consuming alcohol, thus providing circumstantial evidence that the defendant was under the influence. We have further concluded that, based on the record before her, Judge Finn could properly find that Trooper Oly was properly qualified to administer the HGN test to Ballard and to assess the test results. Because of Judge Finn's ruling, Oly could testify that Ballard had failed the HGN test and that this failure indicated that Ballard had alcohol in his blood and might currently be under the influence."
"However, even though this aspect of Trooper Oly's testimony may have amounted to an impermissible attempt to correlate Ballard's HGN test result with a particular level of impairment, we conclude that the error, if any, was harmless under the facts of this case. Both Oly and his supervisor, Trooper Siegfried, gave detailed testimony describing the numerous ways in which Ballard's intoxication was manifest: his breath, his eyes, his inability to stand or balance, his inability to recite the alphabet or to count backwards. Moreover, the prosecutor at Ballard's trial did not accentuate the HGN test. The prosecutor noted that the HGN test results indicated that Ballard was ""impaired"", but the prosecutor gave equal prominence to Ballard's poor performance on the other field sobriety tests, and he urged the jury to ""look at everything"" when determining whether Ballard was under the influence. Given this record, we conclude that the jury's verdict could not have been affected by Oly's arguably impermissible assessment of the HGN test results.
Conclusion
The judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED.
COATS, J., not participating.
. Oly was a newly-commissioned trooper who was completing his field training under the supervision of Trooper Siegfried.
. As explained by Dr. Ronald Nowaczyk, one of the expert witnesses in this case, the ""reliability"" of a scientific test or procedure refers to the degree of uniformity in the results — the likelihood that the test or procedure will again and again yield the same results under the same testing conditions. The ""validity"" of a test or procedure refers to the likelihood that the results accurately reflect the presence or absence of the thing the scientists are looking for. See Charles R. Honts & Susan L. AmatoHenderson, ""Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test: the State of the Science in 1995"", 71 North Dakota Law Rev. 671, 677(1995)."
". But see People v. Kirk, 289 Ill.App.3d 326, 224 Ill.Dec. 452, 456-57, 681 N.E.2d 1073, 1077-78 (1997), declining to follow Buening on the issue of whether HGN has been so widely accepted at the appellate level that, even in the absence of a Frye hearing, a court can take judicial notice that HGN meets the Frye test.
. Oregon does not follow the Frye test. Nevertheless, the O'Key court found that the scientific principles underlying HGN testing are in fact generally accepted within the relevant scientific community. O'Key, 899 P.2d at 686.
. Ballard does cite one case, Young v. City of Brookhaven, 693 So.2d 1355, 1360-61 (Miss.1997), in which a state supreme court ruled that the scientific principles underlying HGN do not meet the Frye standard. However, the Mississippi court's reasoning is simply confused.
There was no Frye hearing in Young, and the defendant appealed on precisely that basis. He claimed that HGN was ""scientific evidence"" for purposes of the Frye rule, and that therefore the State should not have been able to introduce testimony about the HGN results without first presenting an expert witness to lay a Frye foundation. After reviewing decisions from other states, the Mississippi Supreme Court adopted the majority view that HGN is indeed scientific evidence. From this premise, however, the Mississippi court reached a surprising conclusion. Instead of ruling that the HGN evidence should not have been admitted because the trial court held no Frye hearing, the Mississippi court concluded that the scientific principles underlying HGN are not generally accepted within the scientific community:"
"Therefore, this Court finds that the HGN test is not generally accepted within the scientific community and cannot be used as evidence to prove intoxication or as a mere showing of impairment.
Young, 693 So.2d at 1360-61.
In this passage, the Mississippi court confuses two issues: (a) does HGN testing rest on scientific principles, so that a Frye hearing must be held before HGN evidence can be introduced? and (b) if a Frye hearing were held, would the scientific principles underlying the HGN test prove to be generally accepted within the scientific community? The Mississippi court decided (as we decide here) that HGN evidence is ""scientific evidence"" for Frye purposes. It therefore follows that HGN evidence can not be admitted unless the proponent of the evidence presents expert testimony to prove that HGN satisfies the Frye test. There was no Frye hearing in the Mississippi trial court, so the Mississippi Supreme Court could draw no conclusions about the scientific acceptance of HGN from the trial court record. Moreover, none of the case law cited by the Mississippi Supreme Court holds that HGN fails to satisfy Frye. In short, there was no factual or logical basis for the Mississippi court's conclusion that the principles underlying HGN are not generally accepted in the scientific community.
. On appeal, Ballard faults the district court for indicating that one of his expert witnesses might not be within the relevant community of scientists whose views are to be considered when deciding the Frye issue. As indicated in our discussion, we have considered the views of both of Ballard's expert witnesses, and our decision is premised on the assumption that both of Ballard's witnesses are members of the relevant scientific community."
"MANNHEIMER, Judge.
James G. Nathan appeals his conviction for driving while intoxicated, Anchorage Municipal Ordinance 9.28.020. After Nathan was arrested for DWI, he submitted to a breath test (which showed his blood-alcohol level to be .134 percent), and he declined the offer of an independent blood test. However, Nathan contends that the breath test result should be suppressed because, when he gave up his right to an independent blood test, he did not really understand his right to such a test.
Nathan is deaf, and has been since birth. In the trial court, Nathan asserted that, because of his deafness, he was unable to communicate well with the officer who administered the breath test and who explained Nathan's right to an independent blood test. Nathan contended that, because of this difficulty in communication, he was unable to follow the officer's explanation of his right to an independent test. Even though Nathan signed the waiver-of-test form, Nathan stated that he signed the form to please the officer, without understanding what he was relinquishing.
District Court Judge Stephanie Rhoades held a hearing into Nathan's allegations. At this hearing, Nathan testified that his primary language was American Sign Language; he asserted that he was unable to communicate effectively in English, whether oral or written. Nathan's description of his linguistic ability was corroborated by the testimony of his high school teacher, who declared that, at the time Nathan graduated from high school, his ability to read was perhaps at a third-grade level. Nathan's teacher testified that Nathan had a limited ability to read lips."
"Both the officer who arrested Nathan (Derek Hsieh) and the officer who administered the breath test to Nathan (Joe Caswell) testified that Nathan was obviously deaf, and that he remained mute throughout their contacts with him. Caswell, in particular, testified that he was fully aware that Nathan could neither speak nor hear. However, both Hsieh and Caswell also testified that Nathan seemed to understand what they said to him: he followed their directions and otherwise responded appropriately to their remarks and questions. When Caswell asked Nathan (in writing) if he could read and write English, Nathan nodded affirmatively without hesitation. Nathan in fact began to write out a statement concerning the events leading up to his arrest. The ensuing interview between Caswell and Nathan was conducted with pen and paper.
Officer Caswell's testimony was corroborated by the record of Nathan's first appearance and bail hearing in front of Magistrate Roy V. Williams. At that hearing, Magistrate Williams communicated with Nathan by passing written notes back and forth. Following this exchange of written communications, the magistrate was apparently satisfied that Nathan understood the proceedings— and, in particular, his obligation to appear in court at the time stated in his bail release form — because the magistrate released Nathan on his own recognizance after Nathan signed an acknowledgement of the conditions of his release.
After hearing this conflicting testimony, and after listening to the tape of Nathan's first appearance in front of Magistrate Williams, Judge Rhoades concluded that Nathan, despite his disability, had understood his right to an independent test and had knowingly waived that right. Judge Rhoades concluded, based on Nathan's apparent understanding of Officer Hsieh's communications at the scene, that Nathan ""must have been reading Officer Hsieh's lips[;] . the defendant [described] what was being explained to him [by Officer Hsieh] in his own testimony."" With regard to the more important issue of Nathan's communications with, and understanding of, Officer Caswell, Judge Rhoades concluded that Nathan had sufficiently understood the officer to acquire an understanding of his right to an independent test."
". [T]he most compelling [evidence] here [is] that the defendant, though . he does clearly have a basic understanding of English, and does have a basic ability to write English, and was presented with a pen and paper, did not write down, at any time during the DWI processing, that he did not understand^ nor did he] request to have additional information or an interpreter or some other form of understanding the information. And I guess what's important to me about that is that, without dealing with a defendant who is unfamiliar with these resources, apparently the defén- dant did study the driver's license booklet, which all drivers have to study in order to take the written test, he did take a written test, apparently using, according to his own testimony, the assistance of an interpreter. And, so it's not like he doesn't have familiarity with the fact that in circumstances where he doesn't understand something, he needs to request an interpreter. He has done that before, when he wanted to take advantage of the privilege to drive.... The defendant knows how to get the use of resources when he wants to obtain a privilege, but in this case he didn't ask for [interpretative assistance]. And I find that significant. Because now it's a little too convenient [for Nathan] to come in after the fact and say that he didn't understand....
Judge Rhoades cited Nathan's later communications with Magistrate Williams as further corroboration of Nathan's level of understanding:
[Regarding Nathan's] contact with the magistrate, . the magistrate's [duty] here was to make sure that the defendant understood his obligation to return to court. Apparently their communication was effective enough that the magistrate had no concerns about that, [because the magistrate] released him [on] his own recognizance, and the defendant testified [that] he understood when he was to return."
"So, all in all, it would appear to me that the defendant's ability to read and write— while they may be still wholly at a fourth-grade level even now, twenty-three years after school — that he nonetheless, through life experience, his workplace, the fact that he is a licensed driver, the fact that he does manage to exist and live in a world where deaf people, frankly, are not accommodated many times, tells me that he most likely understood, at least to the extent that he needed to understand, that he had a right to an independent test and the other rights that were explained to him on the documents[.] . [I] find that he was adequately advised and he knowingly, intelligently waived his right to an independent test.
On appeal, Nathan attacks Judge Rhoades's finding that he understood his right to an independent test. See Ahtuangaruak v. State, 820 P.2d 310, 311-12 (Alaska App.1991) (a DWI arrestee's purported waiver of the right to an independent test is invalid ""if the arrestee, because of . a language barrier, or [for] any other reason, fails to acquire a basic understanding of the right to an independent test""). On this issue of historical fact, we must affirm the trial judge's ruling unless it is shown to be clearly erroneous. Cockerham v. State, 933 P.2d 537, 539 n. 9 (Alaska 1997).
A finding of fact is ""clearly erroneous"" if, after review of .the record, an appellate court is left ""with a definite and firm conviction . that a mistake has been made, even though there may be evidence to support the [trial court's] finding."" Cockerham, supra. Having reviewed the evidence presented to the district court, we conclude that Judge Rhoades's finding is not clearly erroneous."
"In the end, it was Judge Rhoades's task to assess the credibility of the various witnesses' testimony and to resolve the central issue of fact: did Nathan acquire a basic understanding of his right to an independent test? Anthony v. State, 521 P.2d 486, 492 (Alaska 1974); Long v. State, 772 P.2d 1099, 1101 (Alaska App.1989). The judge resolved this issue against Nathan, and the record provides substantial support for her conclusion. While reasonable people might perhaps draw differing conclusions from the evidence presented at the hearing, we can not say that Judge Rhoades's conclusion is clearly erroneous.
Nathan argues in the alternative that, even if he knowingly waived his right to an independent test, his breath test result should nevertheless be suppressed because the police failed to take reasonable steps to accommodate his hearing and speech disability. Nathan asserts that the police violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., by failing to provide him with an American Sign Language interpreter or to utilize some alternative method to facilitate communication.
Nathan's claim is based on section 12132 of the Act, which declares that ""no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, . be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity"". Elaborating on this statutory provision, one of the regulations promulgated under the Act, 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(1), obligates public entities to ""furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity conducted by a public entity"". .The Act's definition of ""auxiliary aids and services"" expressly includes ""qualified interpreters or other effective methods of making aurally delivered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments"". See 42 U.S.C. § 12102."
"However, even assuming that a police department's processing of arrestees is a ""program"" or ""service"" governed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Act would require the police department to furnish auxiliary aids and services only ""where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of' the arrest processing. (Emphasis added) Moreover, under the statutory definition of ""auxiliary aids and services"", an interpreter would apparently not be required if the police department offered some ""other effective method[]"" of communication. Judge Rhoades found that, despite Nathan's disability, effective communication did in fact take place between Nathan and the officers, and Nathan did understand his right to an independent test. The judge's resolution of these issues of fact constitutes an implicit finding that no violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act took place.
Further, even assuming that the police violated the Act, Nathan must still cross another legal hurdle: he must establish that a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act will trigger the exclusionary rule and require suppression of his breath test result. This is not self-evident.
If Nathan, because of his hearing impairment, had failed to acquire a basic understanding of his right to an independent test, then he would be entitled to suppression of his breath test result. Ahtuangaruak, 820 P.2d at 311-12. But Judge Rhoades found that Nathan did understand his right to an independent test. Thus, Nathan's argument for suppression is a novel one. Nathan argues that even though he did understand his right to an independent test — that is, even though the police department's asserted violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act did not adversely affect his understanding of his rights or the voluntariness of his decision to waive the independent blood test — he still is entitled to suppression of the breath test result. Nathan argues that suppression of evidence is the only effective way to make the police obey the mandates of the Act."
"It is. true that, broadly speaking, the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter the police from engaging in future illegal conduct. Violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act clearly qualify as ""illegal conduct"". However, when the government has violated a statute (as opposed to the Constitution), suppression of evidence has generally been imposed only when the government's violation of the statute demonstrably prejudiced a defendant's ability to exercise related constitutional rights or to prepare or present a defense. For instance, in Sundberg, the police used excessive force to arrest a fleeing suspect, but the supreme court refused to suppress the resulting evidence. The court concluded that other effective means existed to deter future similar illegality; the court cited ""the possibility of . police department [disciplinary] proceedings; civil rights actions; and common law tort suits against the offending officer"". Sundberg, 611 P.2d at 51-52.
Similar measures are apparently available to deter and redress violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Given the existence of these measures, and the absence of any indication that the police have engaged in persistent, purposeful violations of the Act, we hold that exclusion of evidence would not be the remedy even if Nathan could show that the police violated the Act in his case.
The district court properly denied Nathan's motion to suppress his breath test result. Accordingly, the judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED."
"CHRISTEN, Justice.
I. INTRODUCTION
Caroline Kingik's husband, Morris Welch, was enrolled in the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) from 1986 to 1999. Shortly before Welch's retirement, he selected a retirement option that did not include survivor benefits. Kingik consented to this election. Welch died in 2005, and the Division of Retirement and Benefits (the ""Division"") notified Kingik that she would no longer receive benefits from PERS. Kingik appealed to the superior court, arguing that the Division violated her due process rights and that her waiver of survivor benefits was void. Because the waiver form was clear and because Kingik's waiver of benefits was effective, we affirm.
II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
Morris Welch was employed by the North Slope Borough from 1986 until his retirement in 1999. He married Caroline Kingik in 1989 and was married to her at his death in 2005. By virtue of his employment with the Borough, Welch was eligible for medical and retirement benefits from the State of Alaska through PERS. Between his retirement and death, Welch received $139,992.97 from PERS, $46,041.90 more than his lifetime contributions to the program.
Welch began inquiring about early retirement in early 1998. The Division mailed him information providing estimates of the monthly income he could expect to receive depending on when he decided to retire and which retirement option he selected. The estimates were accompanied by a retirement application packet that included a newsletter entitled ""Rights of Spouses and Dependents."" The newsletter explained that if the member chose the ""normal, early or level income"" options and the member's spouse consented, PERS would ""pay monthly benefits to the member during his or her lifetime, but [would] not pay monthly benefits to the spouse after the member's death."""
"Alaska Statute 89.35.450 requires PERS members to provide their spouse's written consent when they select a retirement option that does not include survivor benefits. The one-page Application for Retirement Benefits form Welch signed shows his selection of the Level Income Option and Kingik's notarized signature consenting to his selection.
Welch was later reminded that he did not select a survivor option. In 1998 Welch sued the North Slope Borough over an ordinance that gave an employment preference to Native Americans. The ordinance was later declared ""invalid and unenforceable."" As part of the 2005 settlement of the discrimination case, the Borough paid nearly four years of retirement benefits into PERS on Welch's behalf and credited him with four more years of service. During the negotiations to settle the discrimination claim, the Division sent Welch a revised projection of his PERS retirement benefits showing the money the Borough anticipated paying into his PERS account. The Division's letter reminded Welch that he had selected the Level Income Option and that ""[flailure to choose one of the three survivor options means ALL benefits, including health insurance, will stop when you die"" and ""Important notice: there are no survivor options with an LIO."" (Emphasis in original.)
Neither Welch nor his attorney ever contacted the Division to object or protest his selection of the Level Income Option. Had Welch chosen an option with survivor benefits, he would have received a significantly lower monthly benefit during his lifetime. Instead, Welch received enhanced monthly benefits for the remainder of his life, and never attempted to change his election."
"Kingik wrote to the Administrator of the Division about her right to receive benefits, but the Administrator upheld the Division's initial denial of benefits. Kingik then appealed to the Office of Administrative Hearings, where the parties filed eross-motions for summary adjudication. The administrative law judge (ALJ) granted the Division's motion, in part. The ALJ ruled that Kingik's waiver of survivor benefits was valid and rejected her argument that the Division had a duty to notify Welch that he had an opportunity to re-designate his retirement benefit when he settled his discrimination claim in 2005-the settlement provided no such opportunity. But the ALJ ruled that issues of fact prevented him from deciding as a matter of law what Welch intended when he completed the Application for Retirement Benefits form. After holding an evidentiary hearing on the ""single issue of the intent and significance of Mr,. Welch's elections,"" the ALJ found by a preponderance of the evidence that Welch had intended to select the Level Income Option.
Kingik appealed the administrative decision to the superior court, arguing that her own due process rights had been violated, that Welch's due process rights had been violated, and that her waiver of survivor benefits was ineffective. The superior court affirmed the administrative decision, ruling that: (1) Kingik did not have third-party standing to litigate a violation of Welch's rights; (2) substantial evidence supported the administrative decision that the waiver form was objectively clear; (8) Kingik did not have a vested constitutional right to receive survivor benefits when she signed the waiver; and (4) the evidence did not support Kingik's argument that the waiver was invalid for lack of mutual consent or because of a unilateral mistake."
"III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
This case requires us to review a superior court order affirming an agency decision. ""When the superior court acts as an intermediate court of appeal in an administrative matter, we independently review and directly serutinize the merits of the [administrative] decision."" ""No deference is given to the superior court's decision when that court acts as an intermediate court of appeal.""
Two standards of review are relevant in this case. First, we review findings of fact under the substantial evidence test. Substantial evidence is ""such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."" Second, we apply the substitution of judgment test when reviewing constitutional questions and questions of law not involving agency expertise. When exercising our independent judgment, we ""adopt the rule of law that is most persuasive in light of precedent, reason, and policy.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. Kingik Waived Her Argument That She Has Third-Party Standing To Litigate A Violation Of Welch's Constitutional Rights.
In her appeal to our court, Kingik argues that she has third-party standing to litigate an alleged violation of Weleh's constitutional rights. But she did not make this argument before the ALJ. Instead, Kingik argued at the administrative level that ""the operative question . [is] what, if anything, did the Department do to safeguard Ms. Kingik's constitutional rights[?]"" We have held that ""[al party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal. Because Kingik did not make her third-party standing argument before the ALJ, it was not properly part of her appeal to the superior court. It is not properly part of the present appeal for the same reason. Kingik waived this argument."
"Kingik argued before the ALJ that the Division's failure to safeguard her constitutional right to survivor benefits violated due process. She contends that the Division should have taken additional steps to ""ensure that Ms. Kingik's purported waiver was valid and intentional."" The Division countered that Kingik's constitutional rights were not violated because ""spouses of retirees do not hold a constitutional right to survivor benefits.""
We adopted the Mathews v. Eldridge test for procedural due process claims in Hilbers v. Municipality of Anchorage. Under that test, courts identify the specific requirements of due process by considering:
[Flirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and, finally, the Government's interest, including the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.[ ]
We need not decide whether Kingik had a protected property interest in Welch's PERS retirement benefits because we conclude the Division's procedures satisfied due process. Kingik claims an interest in the receipt of survivor benefits if Welch predeceased her. The Division's interest is in the efficient administration of PERS. Kingik's position is that the Division's procedures were inadequate because it could have modified its forms to ""more clearly and concisely convey to its members (and their spouses) the ef-feets and consequences of their selections."" But our conclusion that the waiver form is reasonably clear disposes of Kingik's argument; the likelihood of an erroneous deprivation of survivor benefits caused by the form is very low because of the waiver form's plain language. Applying the Mathews factors, we conclude that Kingik was not denied due process."
"1. The waiver form was clear.
Kingik argues her waiver of survivor benefits is invalid because the waiver form she signed is confusing and misleading. Kin-gik testified that she thought the Application for Retirement Benefits form's waiver only affected her right to receive dental and vision coverage through PERS. She explained that her understanding of the waiver's effect was based on conversations she had with Welch where, she alleges, Welch assured her that she would receive surviving spouse benefits and medical coverage after he died. Kingik admitted that she ""[mJost likely"" did not read the form before signing it. The Division argues that, despite Kingik's subjective misunderstanding, the waiver is objectively clear and effectively describes the rights spouses relinquish by signing it.
The clarity of the Division's waiver form is a legal question we review de novo. Both parties cite to ERISA regulations governing waiver and agree that the waiver language on the form Kingik signed was required to describe or explain the right the spouse is giving up and affirmatively state that the spouse is giving up a right rather than contain generalized and indeterminate language.
The ALJ concluded that the waiver form ""reasonably describes or explains the right the spouse is giving up"" and ""is very clear in categorizing three options as 'Survivor Options.'"" Directly under the section where the member selects his or her retirement benefit option, the form cautions: ""IMPORTANT . ALL BENEFITS INCLUDING MEDICAL COVERAGE WILL CEASE UPON DEATH OF THE APPLICANT if a survivor option is not selected."" (Emphasis in original.) Following this warning, the form contains a section entitled ""SPOUSE'S WAIVER OF SURVIVOR OPTION"" with a signature line for the spouse to ""acknowledge and approve the benefit selected"" and to ""freely waive entitlement to continuing survivor benefits . upon the death of the named applicant."" (Emphasis in original.) Because the survivor options are clearly designated, because the form unambiguously warns that ""all benefits including medical coverage"" will cease on the applicant's death if a survivor option is not selected, and because the form contains a clearly-worded waiver clause, we agree with the ALJ that the waiver plainly and adequately describes both the rights and the effect of signing the form."
"The Division's forms could be improved, but we agree with the ALJ's conclusion that the Application for Retirement Benefits form describes the rights Kingik relinquished by signing the waiver. We are satisfied that the form adequately explained that Kingik's benefits would stop upon Welch's death if no survivor option was selected.
2. Kingik bore the risk of her unilateral mistake.
Kingik argues that she is entitled to void the waiver because she was mistaken as to its basic assumption-that signing it would affect her right to receive survivor benefits.
The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 154 explains that a party bears the risk of the mistake when: ""(a) the risk is allocated to him by agreement of the parties; or (b) he is aware, at the time the contract is made, that he has only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake relates but treats his limited knowledge as sufficient; or (c) the risk is allocated to him by the court on the ground that it is reasonable under the cireumstances to do so.
Kingik argues that she does not bear the risk of her mistake under Restatement § 154(b) and (c). Regarding subsection (b), she argues she ""was not aware that she had only limited knowledge with respect to the facts to which the mistake related"" because she ""believed she was waiving one thing when she purportedly waived another."" The Division counters that Kingik bore the risk of the mistake because she ""acted with what she knew was limited knowledge but treated that knowledge as sufficient."" Kingik's admission that she ""[mjost likely"" did not read the waiver form or other parts of Welch's retirement application undermines her ability to claim mistake as a defense. If she did not read the waiver, she must have known she was acting with limited knowledge of the contents and meaning of the contract, yet her signature indicates that she treated her knowledge of it as sufficient. Under these circumstances, the law requires that Kingik bear the risk of her mistake."
"3. The contract does not fail for lack of mutual assent.
Kingik alleges that she did not subjectively intend to waive anything other than dental and vision coverage. Therefore, she argues, there was no ""meeting of the minds on the essential terms of the offer"" and she did not form a valid contract with the Division. Contract formation is a legal question not involving agency expertise, so we apply the substitution of judgment standard of review.
Mutual assent is an elementary requirement of an enforceable contract. An ""agreement to a contract may be imputed based on the reasonable meaning of a party's words and acts. ""Because a contract is assessed under an objective standard, if a party objectively manifested an intention to be bound by the terms of a contract, that assent cannot be defeated by evidence of the party's . subjective contrary intentions."" Kingik signed and notarized a waiver that contained a plainly worded clause stating that her benefits would cease unless a surviv- or option was selected. Her signature was an objective manifestation of intent sufficient to create an enforceable contract with the Division. Only Kingik's objective manifestations of intent may be considered. Her unexpressed subjective intentions are irrelevant to the mutual assent analysis as a matter of law. Therefore, the contract does not fail for lack of mutual assent.
Finally, Kingik argues that she and the Division had a material misunderstanding and that this misunderstanding prevented contract formation. She points out that while the Division intended the waiver to be a waiver of survivor benefits, she only meant it to waive her vision and dental benefits. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 20 recognizes an exception to the normal mutual assent rules for certain misunderstandings. Under the Restatement, ""(there is mo manifestation of mutual assent to an exchange if the parties attach materially different meanings to their manifestations and . neither party knows or has reason to know the meaning attached by the other."" This portion of Kingik's argument fails because, as the Division points out, it had no way of knowing that Kingik subjectively intended to waive only vision and dental coverage, but Kingik did have reason to know that the Division intended the waiver to affect her survivor benefits. Indeed, the waiver Kingik signed contained no reference to dental or vision coverage, but it did include express language regarding waiver of survivor benefits. The Restatement's exception for misunderstandings does not support Kingik's claim."
"The ALJ held an evidentiary hearing to determine which option Welch intended to select when he completed the Application for Retirement Benefits form. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding that Welch intended to select the Level Income Option.
The ALJ found that Welch was a ""fairly sophisticated man with excellent literacy"" who was capable of reading and understanding the Division's forms. While not extensive, the record includes evidence adequate to support this finding: Welch worked for the North Point School District as a supervising operator of a Point Hope utility, he started a home business selling Alaska Native art, and he authored an article that the ALJ read about the experience of building a website to sell art.
Other documentary evidence supports the ALJ's finding that Welch intended to select the Level Income Option. Welch consistently chose the Level Income Option as his preferred choice for receiving his retirement benefits: he unequivocally marked the Level Income Option on the Application for Retirement Benefits form and included Kingik's waiver as required by the form; he signed and submitted the Retirement Benefits Election Level Income Option form; he expressly declined the Division's offer to provide him information concerning spousal benefits when given the opportunity to request it; he received enhanced monthly benefits for several years without objection; and he never attempted to change his election-even after the settlement of his 2005 discrimination claim when he was reminded that the Level Income Option did not include survivor benefits. We conclude substantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding that Welch intended to select the Level Income Option."
"For the reasons explained above, the decision of the ALJ is AFFIRMED.
WINFREE, Justice, not participating.
. The Division had no stake in which option Welch chose; each choice had the same actuarial value and was therefore projected to cost the Division the same amount. See AS 39.35.450(b); AS 39.35.460 (repealed by ch. 4, FSSLA 1996).

"OPINION
MANNHEIMER, Judge.
Estin W. Borchgrevink appeals his convie-tions for first-degree assault (infliction of serious physical injury) and for a merged count of first-degree sexual assault and first-degree sexual abuse of a minor (non-consensual sexual penetration of a child under the age of 13). The issue on appeal is whether the State should have been allowed to introduce evidence at Borchgrevink's trial concerning an out-of-court statement made by the 2 4-year-old victim when she was examined at the hospital by an emergency room physician and nurse."
"At Borchgrevink's trial, the emergency room physician, the emergency room nurse, and E.P.'s mother (who was also present during the examination) were allowed to give hearsay testimony describing E.P.'s statements.
However, as we explain in more detail later in this opinion, the trial judge granted a defense motion to declare E.P. incompetent to be a witness, and thus E.P. did not testify at Borchgrevink's trial.
At trial, Borchgrevink conceded that he was the one who caused the injuries to E.P 's head. Because of this concession, the admissibility of E.P.'s statement identifying Bor-chgrevink as the one who inflicted her head injuries is a moot issue. However, Borchgre-vink denied that he was the one who inflicted the injuries to E.P.'s genitals and perineum, and he actively objected to the admission of E.P.'s statement identifying him as the one who inflicted these injuries.
For the reasons explained in this opinion, we conclude that the admission of the testimony describing E.P.'s out-of-court statements was not reversible error, and we therefore affirm Borehgrevink's convictions.
The litigation of this issue in the superior court
Two days before Borchgrevink's trial began, the trial judge (Superior Court Judge pro tempore Peter G. Ashman) held a hearing to address the admissibility of this evidence.
The prosecutor argued that this testimony was admissible under two different theories: first, that it was a ""first complaint"" of sexual assault for purposes of the ""first complaint"" doctrine recognized by the Alaska Supreme Court in Greenway v. State, 626 P.2d 1060 (Alaska 1980); and second, that it was admissible under Alaska Evidence Rule 808(4) because E.P.'s statements were made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment."
"Similarly, with respect to the State's theory that E.P.'s statements were admissible under the medical diagnosis or treatment exception codified in Evidence Rule 808(4), Borchgrevink's attorney argued that the medical diagnosis or treatment exception does not allow the State to introduce out-of-court statements concerning the identity of the person who inflicted the patient's injuries.
In the alternative (i.e., under the assumption that Evidence Rule 803(4) might permit evidence of a sexual abuse victim's identification of their assailant), the defense attorney argued that E.P. was so young when she spoke to the doctor (she was two and a half years old) that she would not have understood that the doctor's inquiry concerning the identity of her assailant had anything to do with medical diagnosis or treatment.
After hearing the parties' arguments, Judge Ashman took the matter under advisement. Later that afternoon, he called the parties back to court and announced his decision.
With regard to whether E.P.'s out-of-court statements were admissible under the Green-way ""first complaint"" rule, Judge Ashman noted that this Court had issued seemingly contradictory statements on the question of whether evidence of a vietim's first complaint can include an identification of the perpetrator of the sexual assault or sexual abuse. After declaring that he could not find a unifying rationale to fully explain or reconcile our prior statements on this issue, Judge Ash-man ruled that E.P.'s out-of-court identification of Borchgrevink as her assailant was admissible under the ""first complaint"" rule."
"(Judge Ashman's assessment of the medical relevance of this information for treat ment purposes was corroborated by the testimony of another physician at Borchgrevink's trial-ie, not the emergency room doctor, but another doctor who later supervised E.P.'s treatment. This second physician testified that, because E.P.'s injuries were reported to have been caused by sexual penetration by an adult male, E.P. was treated with antibiotics in case she had been infected with a sexually transmitted disease, and E.P. was screened for HIV, syphilis, and other sexually transmitted diseases.)
Whether evidence that E.P. identified Bor-chgrevinik as her assailant was admissible under the Greenway ""first complaint"" evidence rule
As we explained earlier, Borchgrevink was charged with both physical assault on E.P. (resulting in the injuries to her head) and sexual assault on E.P. (resulting in the injuries to her genitals and perineum).
In his testimony at his trial, Borchgrevink conceded that he was the one who inflicted the injuries to E.P.'s head, and that these injuries were inflicted on March 16, 2006, while E.P.'s mother was at work. (E.P. was taken to the doctor late in the afternoon of March 16th.)
However, Borchgrevink denied that he was the one who inflicted the injuries to E.P.'s genitals and perineum. Borchgrevink asserted that these injuries were inflicted one or possibly two days earlier-Lie., late on March 14th, or on March 15th-while Bor-chgrevink was at work and E.P. was in the care of others (namely, her mother and her grandparents, Kristine and Richard Squire)."
"On appeal, Borchgrevink argues that the admission of this testimony was error. Bor-chgrevink notes that, traditionally, testimony admitted under the ""first complaint"" rule was limited to the fact that the victim had reported being sexually assaulted or abused; the testimony was not to include the victim's statements about the details of the assault or abuse-in particular, the victim's identification of the perpetrator. See Greenway, 626 P.2d at 1061 n. 4, citing John Henry Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law (Chadbourn rev. 1972), § 1136, Vol. 4, p. 306.
Borchgrevink acknowledges that this Court has, at times, upheld the admission of ""first complaint"" testimony concerning the victim's identification of their assailant or abuser. See, e.g., Strumsky v. State, 69 P.3d 499, 502-03 (Alaska App.2003); Nusunginya v. State, 730 P.2d 172, 173-74 (Alaska App. 1986), Nitz v. State, 720 P.2d 55, 58, 63 (Alaska App.1986). (We also note that, at least once, we declared this aspect of a victim's first complaint to be inadmissible. D.G. v. State, 754 P.2d 1128, 1129 (Alaska App. 1988).)
But Borchgrevink argues that even if the victim's identification of the perpetrator is potentially admissible under the ""first complaint"" evidence rule, such identity testimony is admissible only if the identity of the perpetrator is not disputed, and then only if the victim takes the stand at trial.
(a) The debate as to whether ""first complaint"" evidence may include the victim's identification of the perpetrator"
"In footnote 4 of the Greenway decision (626 P.2d at 1061), our supreme court stated that ""first complaint"" evidence is traditionally confined to ""the fact of the complaint"", and that ""[tlestimony . pertaining to 'details' of the victim's complaint is generally not admissible."" However, the authority that the supreme court cited for this proposition, Wig-more's Evidence in Trials at Common Law (Chadbourn rev. 1972), § 1186, states a somewhat different rule. actually
Wigmore does indeed say that the ""first complaint"" rule authorizes admission of ""the fact of [the] complaint . only"" (emphasis in the original), but then Wigmore explains that, for this purpose, the ""fact of the complaint"" includes the victim's statements concerning ""the time and place"" of the assault, so that the trier of fact can ""identify [that] time and place with that of the [offense] charged"". Id., Vol. 4, p. 807.
It is true that the traditional formulation of the ""first complaint"" rule precluded testimony concerning a victim's identification of the perpetrator of the assault, and several courts still follow this rule. See People v. Ware, 323 Ill.App.3d 47, 256 Ill.Dec. 28, 751 N.E.2d 81, 86 (2001); State v. Grady, 183 NW.2d 707, 715-16 (Iowa 1971); State v. Krieger, 803 A.2d 1026, 1031 (Me.2002); Sanches v. State, 351 S.C. 270, 569 S.E.2d 363, 365 (2002); State v. Fleming, 27 Wash.App. 952, 621 P.2d 779, 782-83 (1980). See also People v. Brown, 8 Cal. 4th 746, 35 Cal.Rptr.2d 407, 883 P.2d 949, 958-960 (1994) (disavowing the common-law rationale for admitting this evidence, but still limiting the evidence to (1) the fact of the victim's complaint and (2) the cireumstances surrounding the victim's making of the complaint)."
"The defendant in Greenway was accused of raping his teenage stepdaughter while the two of them were staying at Greenway's summer fish camp. 626 P.2d at 1060. Under these cirenmstances, testimony concerning the stepdaughter's description of the time and place of the sexual assault would be tantamount to an assertion that Greenway was the one who perpetrated the crime.
Similarly, when a case involves the sexual abuse of a young child, the child's description of the time and place of the sexual abuse will often effectively amount to an assertion that a particular caretaker was the abuser. As this Court noted in Nitz v. State, 720 P.2d 55 (Alaska App.1986), there often may be ""(little] utility [in] attempting to conceal the identity of the person accused in the victim's first complaint where the victim is a child who accuses a parent or step-parent of sexual assault""-because ""even the least astute of jurors will readily be capable of surmising that the victim's complaint was directed at the parent who has been charged with the offense."" Id. at 63. Thus, even under the ""first complaint"" doe-trine as traditionally applied, the trier of fact will know, or will be able to easily guess, the identity of the person whom the victim named as the perpetrator, even when this information is not explicitly presented in court. Perhaps because of this, there has been a modern trend to broaden the seope of ""first complaint"" evidence to include the vie-tim's identification. As this Court noted in Nite:"
"Nitz, 720 P.2d at 63 (citations omitted).
As stated in the preceding paragraph from Nitz, several jurisdictions have expanded the ""first complaint"" doctrine to include the vice-tim's identification of the perpetrator. See State v. Troupe, 237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917, 928-29 (1996); Nelson v. State, 137 Md.App. 402, 768 A.2d 738, 744 n. 2 (2001); Commonwealth v. Licata, 412 Mass. 654, 591 N.E.2d 672, 674 (1992), as modified in Commonwealth v. King, 445 Mass. 217, 834 N.E.2d 1175, 1197-98 (2005); State v. Blohm, 281 N.W.2d 651, 652-53 (Minn.1979); Commonwealth v. Krick, 164 Pa.Super. 516, 67 A.2d 746, 749-750 (1949); State v. Twyford, 85 S.D. 522, 186 N.W.2d 545, 548-550 (1971); State v. Sanders, 691 S.W.2d 566, 568 (Tenn.Crim.App.1984). See also State v. Cook, 280 N.C. 642, 187 S.E.2d 104, 109 (1972) (the victim did not know her assailant, but the court allowed ""first complaint"" evidence of the victim's description of her assailant).
This Court has issued several decisions in which we upheld ""first complaint"" evidence that included the victim's assertion of the perpetrator's identity. Our decision in Nitz is one example: the ""first complaint"" evidence in Nitz included the victim's identification of the perpetrator, Nitz, 720 P.2d at 58, and this Court held that the evidence was admissible. Id. at 63.
But the Nitz decision presented a problem for future cases because this Court seemingly offered differing rationales for our decision.
First, the Nitz decision offers the view that descriptions of a victim's ""first complaint"" might as well include the victim's identification of the perpetrator, since it is so often pointless to enforce the contrary, traditional rule. As we noted in Nitz, there is ""[little] utility [in] attempting to conceal the identity of the person accused"" because ""even the least astute of jurors will readily be capable of surmising that the victim's complaint was directed at the parent who has been charged with the offense."" Id. at 68."
"But the Nitz decision also states that evidence of the victim's identification of the perpetrator poses no danger because ""[ilden-tity will seldom be an issue in such cases"". Id. at 68. As Judge Ashman apparently perceived when he tried to ascertain what rule the Nitz decision was actually endorsing, this aspect of Nitz is really a ""harmless error"" analysis-as opposed to the view that the victim's identification of the perpetrator is a proper component of ""first complaint"" evidence.
In Nitz, all of these rationales apparently led to the same result-so the tension between them was muted. But Judge Ashman was confronted with a case where the identity of the perpetrator was disputed, so he was forced to choose between the differing rationales. He adopted the view that ""first complaint"" evidence can properly include the vie-tim's identification of the perpetrator.
This is, indeed, the rule suggested by this Court's subsequent decisions on this issue. In Nusunginya v. State, 730 P.2d 172 (Alaska App.1986), two witnesses (the victim's ten-year-old cousin and the victim's aunt) testified about a child's complaint of sexual abuse by her father. Id. at 173. We upheld the admission of the victim's statement to her cousin under the ""first complaint"" rule, noting that the challenged testimony ""did not provide any significant detail, apart from establishing that [the victim] had identified Nusunginya as her assailant."" Ibid. (emphasis added). We added that the challenged testimony ""helped provide a context in which the [victim's] complaint could be viewed""-and ""[thus, applying the first complaint exception, . the trial court did not err in allowing [the cousin] to testify."" Id. at 174."
"See also Thompson v. State, 769 P.2d 997 (Alaska App.1989), where this Court held that evidence of the victim's first complaint was admissible even though the challenged testimony included the victim's identification of the perpetrator. Id. at 998, 1001, 1002-03. Accord: Murray v. State, 770 P.2d 1131, 1133, 1137 (Alaska App.1989); Horton v. State, 758 P.2d 628, 630-31 (Alaska App. 1988).
It is true that, in both Nusunginya and Kosbruk, this Court suggested that our ruling hinged, at least in part, on the fact that the identity of the perpetrator was not at issue. Judge Ashman declared that he could not understand the relevance of this fact, and we agree that he had a reasonable basis for his perplexity.
There may be cases of sexual assault or sexual abuse where the identity of the perpetrator truly is not at issue-for example, where the defendant openly admits the act of sexual contact or sexual penetration, but asserts that the sexual activity was consensual (in the case of an adult) or that the sexual contact or penetration was ""performed for the purpose of administering a recognized and lawful form of treatment that is reasonably adapted to promoting the physical health of the person being treated"". AS 11.81.900(b)(59)(B).
But in Nits Nusunginya, and Kosbruk, the defendants did not concede that they were the ones who engaged in sexual activity with the children. Rather, the defendants denied that they had done the things the children accused them of. Identity may not have been actively litigated at the defendants' trials; nevertheless, the identity of the perpetrator was disputed (as a legal matter). If, for instance, there had been some physical evidence that arguably corroborated the vie-timsg' claims of sexual activity, the defendants in Nitz Nusunginye, and Kosbruk might well have argued-perfectly consistently-that (a) no sexual activity occurred, but if it did, (b) they were not the one who engaged in the sexual activity with the victim, and the victim was lying or was mistaken about the identity of the perpetrator."
"(b) The limited admissibility of ""first complaint"" evidence-and why we conclude that the limited purpose of this evidence provides an answer to the question of whether ""first complaint"" evidence can include the victim's identification of the perpetrator
At this point in our analysis, it may be helpful to stand back for a moment and consider whether this entire debate-i.e., the ongoing controversy about whether ""first complaint"" evidence should include information about the victim's identification of the perpetrator-might be viewed as ""academic"", in the pejorative sense of having no practical or useful significance to the litigation of erim-inal cases in the real world. The reason why the resolution of this debate may have no practical significance is that ""first complaint"" evidence is not admitted for the truth of the matters asserted. Rather, this evidence is admitted for the limited purpose of lending corroboration to the victim's in-court testimony, by establishing that the victim did in fact complain of the sexual assault or sexual abuse at an earlier time.
This rationale, and the limited purpose for which ""first complaint"" evidence is admitted, are discussed in § 1135-86 of Wigmore (the same portion of Wigmore that was cited by our supreme court in Greenway ). Wigmore explains that the law's traditional proscription of the ""details"" of the victim's earlier complaint was intended to deter the jury from treating the victim's out-of-court statement as ""a hearsay assertion"". In other words, it was intended to deter the jury from viewing the out-of-court statement as substantive proof of the matters asserted in that statement-as independent evidence of the defendant's guilt. Wigmore, § 1186, Vol. 4, p. 807."
"Thus, there may be little practical significance whether ""first complaint"" evidence can properly include information about the vie-tim's identification of the perpetrator-because (1) ""first complaint"" evidence is admissible only if the victim testifies at the trial, see Wigmore, § 1136, Vol. 4, pp. 807-811; and (2) it is error for the jury to rely on the victim's out-of-court statement as substantive proof of the matters asserted.
See State v. Samuels, 273 Conn. 541, 871 A.2d 1005, 1011-12 (2005); Fitzgerald v. United States 443 A.2d 1295, 1303-04 (D.C.App.1982); Commonwealth v. Licata, 412 Mass. 654, 591 N.E.2d 672, 674-75 (1992), as modified in Commonwealth v. King, 445 Mass. 217, 834 N.E.2d 1175, 1197-98 (2005); People v. Straight, 430 Mich. 418, 424 N.W.2d 257, 261 (1988).
(This limitation does not apply when the victim's statement is offered as hearsay under an exception to the hearsay rule, such as the exceptions for excited utterances, Alaska Evidence Rule 808(2), prior inconsistent statements, Alaska Evidence Rule 801(d)(1)(A), or prior consistent statements, Alaska Evidence Rule 801{(d)(1)(B). If the out-of-court statement is admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, then the jury can rely on it for the truth of the matters asserted. See People v. Brown, 8 Cal.4th 746, 35 Cal.Rptr.2d 407, 408 n. 1, 883 P.2d 949, 950 n. 1 (1994).)
For these reasons, it may ultimately be more profitable to view the controversy about whether ""first complaint"" evidence should include the victim's identification of the perpetrator as, in essence, a debate about how Evidence Rule 403 should be applied to this situation."
"The law's traditional ban on the inclusion of ""details"" in first complaint evidence appears to be based on the perception that, the more detailed the witness's description of the victim's out-of-court statement, the greater the likelihood that the jury will treat the witness's ""first complaint"" testimony as substantive evidence, separate from (and independent of) the victim's in-court testimony.
A closely analogous problem is presented when expert witnesses testify under the authority of Alaska Evidence Rule 703 about conclusions they have reached based on underlying information or data that they did not collect or observe themselves. Alaska Evidence Rule 708 allows experts to testify about this underlying information or data even though this testimony, if offered independently, could not survive a hearsay challenge or a challenge based on the witness's lack of personal knowledge. Technically, this testimony is not ""hearsay""-in other words, it is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather for the limited purpose of explaining how the expert reached their conclusions.
But as this Court recently noted in Vonn v. State, 229 P.3d 197, 208-09 (Alaska App. 2010), there are times when (1) there is no other admissible evidence of the underlying information or data, and (2) as a practical matter, there is a substantial danger that the jury will assume the truth of some or all of this underlying information or data. For this reason, Evidence Rule 705(c) authorizes a trial judge to prohibit the expert witness from testifying about these underlying matters ""if the danger that [the expert's testimony concerning these matters] will be used for an improper purpose outweighs their value as support for the expert's opinion""."
"This is essentially the same danger presented by ""first complaint"" evidence if it is so detailed that it practically amounts to out-of-court ""testimony""-that is, if it is so detailed that it might prompt the jury to resolve questions of fact based on the content of the victim's out-of-court statement rather than on the live testimony and physical evidence presented in court, or if it might prompt the jury to resolve issues of credibility by treating the out-of-court statement as the equivalent of a separate corroborating ""witness"".
With particular regard to the question of whether ""first complaint"" evidence should include information about the victim's identification of the perpetrator, we stand by what we said in Nifz as a general rule, there appears to be ""little need for artificial limits"" on a witness's description of the general content of the victim's statement. It will often be obvious who the victim named or described. And, particularly in cases where a young child reports being assaulted or abused by a family member or a caretaker who is well known to the child, it is potentially misleading to delete the child's identification of the perpetrator-because the jury might assume that the child would naturally name the perpetrator if the child knew the perpetrator, and thus the jury might mistakenly conclude that the child named someone other than the defendant, or was unable to identify their assailant.
On the other hand, a trial judge should have the discretion to redact this identification information from the ""first complaint"" witness's testimony if there is a substantial danger that the jury will view this information as independent proof of the defendant's guilt. As we discussed in Nitz, this danger can be significant if ""a parade of witnesses is allowed to offer evidence of [the victim's] prior . statements"", 720 P.2d at 70, or if the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime is based on ""the testimony of . [al] relatively inarticulate child"", bolstered by the testimony of ""a series of articulate adult witnesses"", id. at 71."
"For the reasons we have explained in this section of our opinion, we do not construe Nitz, Nusunginya, and Kosbruk as standing for the rule that a lack of dispute about the identity of the perpetrator is an unvarying foundational requirement that must be satisfied before ""first complaint"" evidence can properly include information about the victim's identification of the perpetrator. Rather, we view Nits, Nusunginya, and Kosbruk as saying that if the identity of the perpetrator is not actively disputed, then there is considerably less danger that the jury will treat the vietim's out-of-court identification of the perpetrator as substantive evidence-and, conversely, that if the identity of the perpetrator is actively disputed, this is a significant factor that a trial judge should take into account when deciding, under the authority of Evidence Rule 408, whether there is good reason to redact the information concerning the victim's identification of the perpetrator from any testimony describing the victim's first complaint.
(c) The significance of the fact that EP. did not testify at Borchgrevink's trial
By this point in our discussion, attentive readers already will have perceived that the admission of the ""first complaint"" evidence at Borchgrevink's trial presents a serious legal problem-because E.P. did not testify.
As we explained in the preceding seetion of this opinion, ""first complaint"" evidence is admissible only if the victim testifies at the trial. Moreover, it is error for the Jury to rely on the victim's out-of-court statement-here, EP's out-of-court assertion that ""Daddy did this""-as substantive proof of the matter asserted."
"As we explained earlier, the question of whether the emergency room doctor and nurse would be allowed to testify about E.P.'s out-of-court statement (in particular, her identification of Borchgrevink as her assailant) was litigated two days before Bor-chgrevink's trial began. When Judge Ash-man was asked to make a ruling on this issue, it appeared that E.P. was going to testify at Borchgrevink's trial. No one discussed the possibility that E.P. might not testify. More specifically, the defense attorney never argued that E.P. was incompetent to testify, and that therefore it would be improper to admit any first complaint evidence.
The issue of E.P.'s unavailability as a witness did not arise until several days later, in the middle of Borehgrevink's trial, when the State called E.P. to the stand (outside the jury's presence) and attempted to establish her competency as a witness.
At the time of Borchgrevink's trial, EP. was four years old. It soon became clear that she was apparently competent to be a witness under the test established in Evidence Rule 601-ig., she was capable ""of communicating concerning the matter so as to be understood by the court and jury"". EP. answered preliminary questions in a coherent and understandable manner (although, unsurprisingly, the tenor of her answers was characteristic of a young child).
However, E.P. either would not or could not give meaningful answers to any questions about Borchgrevink when she was sitting in court in Borchgrevink's presence. Judge Ashman described E.P 's reaction:"
"And it struck [me that this is] not a memory issue[.] . [It's something else going on.
Borehgrevink's attorney asked Judge Ash-man to declare E.P. incompetent as a witness, arguing that E.P. ""[was] not oriented to time, space, [or] self"". Over the prosecutor's objection, Judge Ashman granted the defense attorney's request.
In his ruling, Judge Ashman declared that ""[E.P.] may be competent [to be a witness at the present time], but if she is, we don't have a real record of her competence as it relates to the time and place of the alleged assault. . . . We have her remembering going to the hospital, [but] that's it.""
Judge Ashman also offered a separate rationale for keeping E.P. off the stand. He declared that he was concerned about Bor-chgrevink's right of confrontation as defined in the United States Supreme Court's decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004):
The Court My concern is this: If we present [E.P.] to the jury ., assuming that she behaves as she has behaved in the courtroom . this morning, all the jury will see is [E.P.] withdrawing, which in and of itself is not probative [of anything]. [But the jury might view her silence and her withdrawal as] evidence against Mr. Borchgrevink .
[The most critical piece of [my] analysis is the [injability [of Borchgrevink and his attorney] to fairly cross-examine [EP.]. The right of confrontation, the Crawford issue here, is the defendant's right to confront and cross-examine the [witness]. And if [E.P.] withdraws, there is nothing the defense can do to cross-examine that reaction. There is no way for the defense to confront the inference that the State would seemingly be asking the jury to make from that withdrawal. So I won't permit [E.P. to testify]."
"Once Judge Ashman granted the defense attorney's request to bar E.P. from taking the stand, it was obvious that the State could no longer meet a crucial foundational requirement for introducing evidence of EP's out-of-court statements under Greenway. However, Borchgrevink's attorney did not ask for a mistrial, nor did he ask Judge Ashman to strike the earlier testimony describing E.P.'s out-of-court statements, nor did he seek any other relief pertaining to the already-admitted ""first complaint"" testimony.
Conceivably, one might try to exeuse the defense attorney's inaction by arguing that, since Judge Ashman also ruled that EP's out-of-court statement was admissible under the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" hearsay exception, the defense attorney had nothing to gain by calling the judge's attention to the fact that the Greenway ""first complaint"" rationale for admitting this evidence was no longer valid. However, as we have already explained, and as we explain again in more detail in the next section of this opinion, Judge Ashman did not rule that E.P.'s specific identification of Borchgrevink as her assailant was covered by the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" hearsay exception. Rather, Judge Ashman declared that the pertinent information for diagnosis and treatment purposes was the fact that E.P. told the doctor that her assailant was an adult male. Thus, when Judge Ashman made his ruling on the admissibility of E.P.'s out-of-court statement, the judge relied on only one rationale-the Greenway ""First complaint"" rationale-as legal authority for introducing evidence that E.P. expressly identified Borchgrevink as her assailant."
"We are therefore confronted with the question of whether we should treat this matter as ""plain error"".
Because E.P. was not a witness at Borchgrevink's trial, the admission of ""first complaint"" evidence describing E.P.'s out-of-court identification of Borchgrevink as her assailant is an obvious error. However, under Alaska law, when a defendant presents a claim of plain error, the defendant must negate the possibility that their attorney's failure to make a timely objection in the trial court was the product of a tactical decision. Moreover, when the record is silent or ambiguous on this point, we apply a presumption that the defense attorney's action (or, more precisely, inaction) was tactical.
Here, Borcehgrevink's attorney could reasonably conclude that it would be pointless to ask Judge Ashman to give a curative instruction to the jurors-i.e., an instruction directing the jurors to disregard the evidence that E.P. identified Borehgrevink as her assailant. And Borchgrevink's attorney had a plausible reason for not seeking a mistrial.
The defense attorney had been successful in his effort to keep E.P. off the stand, on the ground of her incompetency to be a witness. Judge Ashman's decision to prohibit EP. from taking the stand could be viewed as unexpectedly favorable to the defense-because the transcript of E.P.'s voir dire shows that she apparently was a competent witness when she was asked about general topics. Judge Ashman ruled that E.P. was incompetent based on the fact that she either could not, or would not, answer questions that involved Borchgrevink."
"If EP. testified at Borchgrevink's second trial, the defense attorney would have to contend with the Greenway ""first complaint"" evidence all over again. But there was a more serious risk to the defense case if E.P. testified at the trial. First, E.P. might directly identify Borchgrevink as her assailant. Second, E.P. might declare (cither truthfully or not) that she no longer remembered the sexual assault; in that case, E.P.'s out-of-court statement would be admitted as a prior inconsistent statement under Alaska Evidence Rule 801(d)(1)(A). See United States v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554, 559, 108 S.Ct. 838, 842, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 (1988); Natkong v. State, 925 P.2d 672, 677-78 (Alaska App.1996); Van Hatten v. State, 666 P.2d 1047, 1051 (Alaska App.1983). And, under Alaska law, a witness's prior inconsistent statements are substantive evidence; that is, the jury may consider these statements for the truth of the matters asserted.
Of course, we do not know what was running through the defense attorney's mind after Judge Ashman granted the defense attorney's request to declare E.P. incompetent as a witness. But there is at least one plausible tactical reason why an attorney in that position would not ask Judge Ashman to declare a mistrial, and would instead choose to let the trial proceed. This being so, Bor-chgrevink has failed to show that the admission of the ""first complaint"" evidence was plain error.
(d) Summary of our decision regarding the ""first complaint"" evidence
We conclude that ""first complaint"" evidence may include a victim's identification of the perpetrator, but we also conclude that a trial judge has the authority, under Evidence Rule 4083, to exclude this facet of the victim's first complaint if it appears likely that the jury will use this information for an improper purpose-i.e., treat it as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt."
"At that point, the defense attorney might have sought a mistrial (since the challenged first complaint evidence had already been admitted). But the defense attorney did not seek a mistrial, or any other related relief, and the circumstances suggest that the defense attorney may have had a plausible tactical reason for letting the trial continue. We therefore conclude that, even though EP. did not testify at Borchgrevink's trial, the admission of the first complaint evidence was not plain error.
Why we need not decide whether evidence that EP. identified Borchgrevink as her assailant was admissible under the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" exception to the hearsay rule
As we explained earlier, during the litigation of this case in the superior court, the State relied on two separate rationales for introducing EP's out-of-court statement identifying Borchgrevink as her assailant. We have already discussed one of these rationales: the ""first complaint"" doctrine. However, the State also relied on the theory that E.P.'s identification of Borchgrevink was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under Alaska Evidence Rule 808(4)-that is, as a statement made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.
The availability or unavailability of the declarant is irrelevant to the admissibility of an out-of-court statement under Evidence Rule 803(4). Indeed, courts have admitted hearsay under this exception even when the person who made the out-of-court statement was incompetent to testify. See Morgan v. Foretich, 846 F.2d 941, 948-49 (4th Cir.1988); United States v. Nick, 604 F.2d 1199, 1201-02 (9th Cir.1979). However, Borchgrevink argues that the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" hearsay exception was not a proper ground for admitting evidence of E.P.'s out-of-court identification of Bor-chgrevink as her assailant."
"The courts that have construed the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" exeeption to cover a young victim's identification of their assailant have relied on the concept that doctors need to treat the psychological and emotional consequences of sexual abuse and child abuse, and that doctors need to know whether it is safe to send a child home. See United States v. Balfany, 965 F.2d 575, 579 (8th Cir.1992); United States v. George, 960 F.2d 97, 99-100 (9th Cir.1992); Morgan v. Foretich, 846 F.2d 941, 948-950 (4th Cir.1988); United States v. Lingle, 27 M.J. 704, 707 (Air Foree Ct. Military Rev.1988); United States v. Deland, 22 M.J. 70, 74-15 (C.M.A.1986); United States v. Renville, 779 F.2d 430, 436-37 (8th Cir.1985).
See also United States v. Joe, 8 F.3d 1488, 1494-95 (10th Cir.1998) (relying on this same rationale to uphold the admission, under Federal Evidence Rule 803(4), of an adult woman's identification of her husband as the person who had subjected her to domestic abuse).
The courts that reject this expansion of the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" hearsay exception have analyzed the problem differently. These courts note that the underlying premise of the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" exception is not that the information contained in the out-of-court statement is pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment, but rather that the person who makes the out-of-court statement is presumably motivated to be truthful because they are seeking medical treatment either for themselves or for someone else (their child, their spouse, their aged parent, et cetera). Thus, the fact that the identity of a child's abuser may be pertinent to the diagnosis or treatment of the child's medical or psychological problems is irrelevant unless the child understands that this information is pertinent-so that they will be motivated to be truthful when they give this information. See State v. Hinnant, 351 N.C. 277, 523 S.E.2d 663, 668-671 (2000); Cassidy v. State, 74 Md.App. 1, 536 A.2d 666, 678-680 (1988)."
"To recapitulate our earlier description of Judge Ashman's ruling on this issue, Judge Ashman found that when the emergency room physician questioned E.P., it was obvious that she had suffered genital injuries, but it was not clear whether those injuries were the result of a sexual assault, and (if so) whether that assault was performed with an adult male's penis or with some other object. For this reason, Judge Ashman concluded that the doctor's inquiry ""Who hurt you?"" was pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment-because, if E.P.'s injuries resulted from sexual penetration by an adult male's penis, this information was relevant to the doctor's decisions concerning the course of treatment.
At the same time, Judge Ashman acknowledged that the precise identity of E.P.'s assailant might not have been pertinent to the diagnosis or treatment of E.P.'s injuries. The judge stated that ""a better question [for the doctor to ask] would have been, How did this happen?"". However, Judge Ashman concluded that, to the extent the doctor's question ""Who hurt you?"" elicited information about the mechanism by which E.P. suffered the injuries to her genitals and perineum, E.P.'s response was covered by the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" hearsay exception:
The Court [The question] ""Who hurt you?"" could [elicit the responsel, ""I hurt myself"", or ""Another kid hurt me""-which would suggest [that the] injury [was inflicted by] an object of some kind. [E.P.'s statement] that the assailant was an adult male, ""Daddy"", gave the doctor information that was relevant to the diagnosis [and treatment] of the injury, because [that type of] sexual assault carries with it medical consequences which differ from . other kinds of traumatic injury [to the genitals]."
"The limited nature of Judge Ashman's ruling on the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" question seems to have been ""lost in the shuffle"", perhaps because the judge simultaneously ruled that E.P.'s identification of Borchgrevink was admissible under the ""first complaint"" evidence rule. Thus, the more limited admissibility of E.P.'s out-of-court statement under Rule 808(4) may not have appeared to be significant.
But, for present purposes, the limited nature of Judge Ashman's ruling is significant: it means that the legal issue which the parties ask us to resolve was never decided in the superior court. Even though Judge Ash-man allowed the State to introduce evidence that E.P. identified Borchgrevink as her assailant, the judge did not base his ruling on a ""statement for medical diagnosis or treatment"" theory. Judge Ashman never reached the question of whether evidence of a child's out-of-court statement, made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, may properly include the child's identification of their abuser. Accordingly, Borchgrevink's appeal does not require us to resolve that question.
Borchgrevink raises another, broader issue in this appeal. He argues that, because E.P. was only two and a half years old when she suffered her injuries and was taken to the hospital, E.P. was too young to be aware that the questions put to her by the doctor were being asked for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment-and, thus, the State failed to lay the foundation for admitting any of E.P.'s statements to the doctor."
"We acknowledge that the defense attorney did argue that E.P.'s identification of Bor-chgrevink was not admissible under the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" hearsay exception because E.P. did not understand that information concerning the identity of her assailant would help the doctor and the nurse in their evaluation and treatment of her injuries. But Judge Ashman twice asked the defense attorney if he intended to make the broader argument that E.P. was too young to understand that any of the information she gave to the doctor and the nurse was being furnished for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment-and, both times, the defense attorney declined to make that broader argument:
The Court: Well, the two-prongled] test is that the [declarant] has to know that the statements are important for medical diagnosis or treatment, and that [the statements] are reasonable for the physician to rely on. Your position is [that] the two-year-old would not know that she was making a statement for purposes of medical treatment?
Defense Attorney: Well, she's making an identification that is [not] necessary for medical treatment, and .
The Court Your position is that [this] exception to the hearsay rule exists because we believe that people will not fabricate statements when [the statements are] being made for medical diagnostic purposes, because they'd have such a strong interest in giving accurate information. So your position is [that] the child couldn't have known what was going on?
Defense Attorney: Well, she could not know [that] the identification promoted [or] furthered her medical treatment."
"Thus, the argument that Borchgre-vink now makes on appeal-the argument that E.P. was too young to be aware that any of the fnformation she furnished to the doe-tor was intended for medical diagnosis or treatment-is not preserved for appeal. If Borchgrevink is to prevail on this claim, he must show plain error.
In his brief, Borchgrevink asserts that there was no direct evidence presented to the superior court that E.P. understood the nature or purpose of her visit to the hospital. If that is so, it is because the defense attorney did not raise this issue or ask Judge Ashman to make any findings on this issue.
Moreover, even though E.P. may not have been asked directly whether she understood that she had been brought to the hospital so that she could receive treatment for her injuries, there was plenty of cireumstantial evidence to support this inference.
The injuries to E.P.'s head were obvious; it was the presence of those injuries that prompted E.P.'s mother to take her to be examined by her pediatrician, Dr. Ray Carlson. Dr. Carlson was concerned that E.P. might have a skull fracture, so he told E.P.'s mother to take her directly to the hospital emergency room.
The emergency room nurse, Rachel Verba, took E.P. to the bathroom to get a urine sample, but E.P. was unable to urinate: she cried and said that it hurt her to urinate. At that point, Nurse Verba observed blood in E.P.'s diaper, so she took her straight in to see the emergency room physician, Dr. Robert Ledda. Based on Nurse Verba's report, Dr. Ledda examined E.P.'s labia and vaginal opening-where he found dried, erusted blood. Prompted by this discovery and by the obvious injuries to E.P 's head, Dr. Led-da asked E.P. who had hurt her in the head, and who had hurt her in the genital area."
"See also Broderick v. King's Way Assembly of God Church, 808 P.2d 1211, 1220 n. 20 (Alaska 1991); ""When a three[-lyear[-lold girl complains of sexual abuse almost immediately upon being asked for the first time about improper touching, such a complaint has indicia of trustworthiness.""
In other words, even if Borehgrevink's attorney had challenged these foundational elements of the ""medical diagnosis or treat ment"" hearsay exception, a reasonable judge could have rejected the challenge. Accordingly, Judge Ashman did not commit plain error when he ruled that evidence of E.P.'s answers to the doctor's questions was admissible under the ""medical diagnosis or treatment"" hearsay exception.

"OPINION
MANNHEIMER, Judge.
Michael D. Howard appeals his conviction for fourth-degree assault. Howard was con-viected of this crime based on evidence that he kicked another man in the face and ribs. Howard's defense at trial was self-defense; he presented evidence that the purported victim of the assault actually initiated the violence.
The issue presented in this appeal is whether the trial judge acted properly when he allowed the State to rebut Howard's claim of self-defense by presenting evidence of Howard's character for violence, through the testimony of a local police officer."
"When the prosecution offers evidence of the defendant's character for violence under Evidence Rule 404(a)(2), the prosecution is not allowed to prove the defendant's character by introducing evidence of specific acts of violence committed by the defendant. Rather, the prosecution is limited to either (1) testimony concerning the defendant's reputation within a relevant community or group in which the defendant habitually associates, or (2) testimony of witnesses who know the defendant and have an opinion concerning the defendant's character for violence. See Alaska Evidence Rule 405(a).
In the present case, the State presented the testimony of Craig Police Sergeant Robert Ely. Ely testified that he had known Howard for three years, since the time he began working as a police officer in Klawock and Craig. Ely stated that, in his opinion, Howard ""can be a very aggressive individual"".
On appeal, Howard contends that the State failed to establish a sufficient evidentia-ry foundation for Sergeant Ely's testimony-i.e., failed to present evidence that Ely knew enough about Howard to form an opinion concerning his character for violence. However, in the district court, Howard did not object to Ely's testimony on this basis, nor did Howard ever ask the trial judge for permission to voir dire Ely on this issue. This claim is therefore not preserved for appeal.
Nor do we find plain error. When the parties were litigating the question of whether Ely would be allowed to testify, Howard's attorney told the district court that Ely had been the investigating officer in Howard's previous criminal cases. This fact would seemingly support an inference that Ely was sufficiently acquainted with Howard to offer an opinion on Howard's character for aggressiveness or violence."
"This may have been true, but it does not make Howard's situation unique. Any attorney (whether a prosecutor or defense attorney) would face the same dilemma when cross-examining any witness who (on direct examination) has offered an opinion concerning another person's character for violence. If the witness is cross-examined about the basis for their opinion, the witness is likely to offer testimony about their prior dealings with the person in question-i.e¢., testimony concerning instances in which the person demonstrated aggression or violence. This would be true regardless of whether those prior acts of violence led to criminal convie-tions (or even criminal prosecutions), and it would be true regardless of whether the character witness was a police officer or a civilian.
Howard next argues that even if Ely's testimony was admissible under Evidence Rule 404(a)(2), the trial judge nevertheless failed to adequately investigate whether Ely's testimony should have been excluded under Evidence Rule 408 (¢.e., on the ground that its potential for unfair prejudice outweighed its probative value). See Evidence Rule 404(a)(2)(i). But the record shows that the trial judge did engage in this analysis.
When the prosecutor indicated (before trial) that Ely would be called to testify about Howard's character for violence, Howard's attorney urged the trial judge (District Court Judge David V. George) to exclude the proposed testimony-not because it was irrelevant, but because it would be unduly prejudicial. The defense attorney argued that, since Craig and Klawock comprised such a small community, it would be obvious to the jurors that Ely gained his knowledge of Howard's character for violence through prior police contacts."
"In its initial offer of proof, the State proposed to have Ely testify that Howard was an ""extremely violent person"" when he used drugs or alcohol. But Judge George told the prosecutor that Ely would not be allowed to characterize Howard as ""violent""; instead, the judge directed Ely to use the word ""aggressive"". Moreover, Judge George precluded Ely from testifying about Howard's use of drugs or abuse of alcohol because ""that [would] inject{ ] a whole nother prejudicial [aspect] into this [trial]; . folks don't love drugs here."" Judge George also precluded Ely from testifying that he knew Howard through his work as a police officer.
In other words, the record thus shows that Judge George weighed Ely's proposed testimony under Evidence Rule 408: the judge considered the testimony's potential for unfair prejudice, and he took affirmative steps to limit that prejudice.
Howard argues, in one conclusory sentence, that the record fails to support Judge George's conclusion that Sergeant Ely's testimony (redacted in this manner) was more probative than prejudicial.
When we review a trial judge's weighing of probative value versus potential for unfair prejudice under Evidence Rule 403, we review the judge's ruling under the ""abuse of discretion"" standard. The ""abuse of discretion"" standard is employed because this is the type of ruling where there is no ""right"" answer, and where reasonable judges, confronted with the same facts, might come to differing conclusions. Accordingly, we are to affirm the trial judge's ruling unless it is clearly untenable or unreasonable. Gonzales v. State, 691 P.2d 285, 286 (Alaska App.1984)."
"Our conclusion that Judge George did not abuse his discretion in this case should not be read as a blanket approval of the State's calling police officers or other justice system officials to testify about the character of a defendant. Indeed, in Hammer v. State, Alaska App. Memorandum Opinion No. 4716 (June 4, 2003), 2003 WL 21279539, we reversed a conviction because the State presented the defendant's probation officer as a character witness.
In Hammer, we acknowledged that, because Hammer took the stand at his trial, ""the State was undoubtedly entitled to attack Hammer's character for truthfulness by introducing reputation or opinion evidence under Rule 608(2)"". Id. at *2. However, we concluded that ""the fact that the State's character witness was Hammer's probation officer inherently created a substantial possibility of unfair prejudice"" for two reasons: first, [because] Hammer's probation status meant that he had committed prior crimes""; and second, because ""any juror familiar with the criminal justice system in this state [would have realized that] the fact that Hammer had an assigned probation officer (and was not simply on unsupervised probation) meant that he had been convicted of a felony, not a misdemeanor."" Ibid.
We further noted that ""[tlhe State made no effort to show that [Hammer's] probation officer was the only witness (or even the only reasonably available witness) who could give an opinion concerning Hammer's character for truthfulness."" Ibid.
Based on these factors, we held that the trial judge abused his discretion under Alaska Evidence Rule 408 when he allowed the State to call Hammer's probation officer as a character witness. Ibid."
"In Hammer, we concluded that the jurors must have inferred that Hammer had committed erimes in the past if he had a probation officer. But in Howard's case, the State's character witness was a small-town police officer-and, for that reason, it is not so obvious that jurors would draw the infer ence that Howard had committed past crimes.
First, because the cities of Craig and Kla-wock are relatively small, there was a reasonable possibility that Ely would be acquainted with Howard simply because they were residents of the same community, and not because Ely had come to know Howard through police business. As we have explained, Judge George took steps to heighten this inference when he precluded Ely from testifying that his knowledge of Howard arose from his work as a police officer.
Second, even if we assume that the jurors surmised that Ely's acquaintance with Howard stemmed from Ely's work as a police officer, it would not necessarily follow that Howard had a record of past eriminal convictions, or even that Howard had been charged with breaking the law on past occasions. As the Missouri Supreme Court noted in State v. Reilly, 674 S.W.2d 530, 532-33 (Mo.1984), ""It is well known that most police officers have a wide acquaintance among the citizenry in general[,] and the fact that a person is known to a police officer does not necessarily convey the impression that he has a criminal record.""
While the Missouri court's observation might be questionable in cases arising in a large city, we believe that the observation has considerable force in cases arising in small communities, like Craig and Klawock, where police officers are summoned to deal with many situations that do not involve criminal acts, or that do not lead to criminal charges, and where officers frequently come into contact with citizens outside of their police duties."
"For these reasons, we conclude that Howard has failed to show that Judge George acted unreasonably when he concluded that, despite Ely's identity as a police officer, Ely's testimony was more probative than prejudicial under Evidence Rule 403.
Howard raises an additional argument: that Judge George should not have allowed Ely to testify while in uniform. Howard's attorney did raise this objection in the trial court, but we conclude that Judge George did not abuse his discretion when he overruled this objection.
Howard's attorney had already conceded (indeed, had affirmatively relied on) the fact that the jurors lived in the same small community with Ely and would therefore inevitably know that he was a police officer. Consequently, there is no reason to believe that the jurors would have evaluated Ely's testimony any differently if he had appeared in court wearing plain clothes.
Moreover, even though the prosecutor gave plenty of notice of the State's intention to have Sergeant Ely testify as a character witness, Howard's attorney did not raise the objection about Ely's wearing his police uniform until Ely actually appeared in court to give his testimony.
Given these cireumstances, we find that Judge George did not abuse his discretion when he overruled Howard's objection.
Finally, Howard argues that Ely's testimony should have been excluded under Evidence Rule 404(b)(1), the rule that forbids evidence of a person's other crimes or bad acts if that evidence is offered to prove (1) that the person characteristically engages in such acts, and thus (2) is likely to have acted true to character during the episode currently being litigated."
"Order
IT IS ORDERED:
1. Tara U. is the mother of Molly, born April 2003, and Maggie, born February 2006 The girls' father is deceased. Molly and Maggie were both born with high levels of opiates in their systems. As a result, the State of Alaska Office of Children's Services (OCS) placed each of them directly after birth in the custody of their grandmother, Dalila, who shared a home with Tara. OCS provided Dalila with a care and safety plan after Maggie's birth. The plan specified that Tara was not to reside in the home and was not to have unsupervised contact with the girls, but Dalila did not follow the plan. OCS did not come to the home to follow up.
2. In July 2008 OCS received an unsubstantiated report that individuals in Tara's home were selling Oxycontin. In February 2006 Tara admitted that she was addicted to heroin.
3. On April 23, 2008, Tara was arrested and jailed for dealing heroin out of the home she shared with her children and Dalila. The police placed Molly and Maggie in emer-geney custody. This was the first time Tara's children had been taken into the legal custody of OCS.
4. OCS filed an emergency petition for adjudication of the girls as children in need of aid and for temporary custody. In May 2008 the girls were placed with their paternal aunt, Sarah, and OCS gained temporary custody."
"6. Tara was released from jail on bail to a third-party custodian in September 2008.
7. In an Order of Disposition issued in October 2008, the court committed the girls to OCS custody for up to two years. In February 2009, following a permanency hearing, the superior court determined that adoption was the appropriate permanent plan for the girls.
8. The court held a placement hearing in April 2009. OCS indicated its intention to have the girls adopted by their paternal cousin, Kate. Kate had participated in the girls' upbringing since their birth and hoped to adopt them. OCS planned to transfer the girls to Kate's custody when the school year ended. The aunt with whom the girls had been living chose not to be an adoptive placement because of her advanced age. The guardian ad litem (GAL) appointed for the girls testified that they wanted to go back to Dalila's, and presumably Tara's, care but that it was not in their best interests to go back. The court found that it was in the best interests of the children to be placed with Kate.
9. In June 2009 OCS filed a petition for termination of parental rights.
10. Tara returned to jail in July 2009 after allegedly violating a bail condition.
11. A new permanency social worker, Tamara Boeckman, was appointed on August 5, 2009, after Shields went on medical leave. Boeckman spoke with Tara on August 18 at Hiland, and Tara agreed to work a case plan. Boeckman sent Tara a packet for a telephonic substance abuse assessment. She determined that Tara was not eligible for Hiland's mental health assessment and would have to get one after she left custody."
"13. Shields further testified that she wanted Tara to complete a substance abuse assessment and mental health assessment. Tara occasionally called her, at which times Shields would ask Tara if she wanted to work a case plan. Shields testified that she ""really wanted to be able to provide [Tara] whatever supports that she needed to be successful to address her needs in order to be able to parent,"" but that Tara ""clearly stated . that she was not interested in case planning or being part of the case plan."" She also testified that OCS would pay for a substance abuse assessment. She further testified:
I kept offering and trying to engage [Taral. But if she continued to say, I'm not interested, I can't force her to work a plan to get her kids back. But I kept making the door open and I kept offering her. And any time that she would call and say, hey, I have, you know, this is going on with the visits, I certainly didn't hold that against her. I worked with her on that. So the door was definitely open. I kept, you know, asking if she wanted to work a plan, asking her if she was interested.
14. Tara testified at the termination hearing that initially she contacted Shields frequently but was discouraged by Shields's assertion that she would not get her children back. Tara testified that Shields was not helpful and did not provide her with information about mental health assessments or parenting classes. She testified that if her criminal case was resolved, she would work her case plan."
"16, The court made alternate findings that if it were legally able to consider OCS's entire history with the family, pre- and post-removal, then OCS failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that it made reasonable efforts.
17. The court also found that OCS proved by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children. It balanced the harm that would arise from completely separating the girls from their mother, with whom they had a strong bond, against the girls' need for permanency and Tara's inability to provide it. It granted the petition for termination of parental rights.
18. Tara appeals the superior court's findings regarding reasonable efforts and best interests. Both OCS and the GAL argue that the superior court properly terminated Tara's parental rights.
19. We review a superior court's factual findings regarding termination of parental rights for clear error. [A] finding is clearly erroneous when a review of the entire record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that the superior court has made a mistake. * We review de novo whether the superior court's findings satisfy applicable CINA statutes and rules, adopting ""the rule of law that is most persuasive in light of precedent, reason, and policy.""
20. A superior court must make four separate findings before terminating parental rights. In cases involving a non-Indian child, the court must find by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the child is a child in need of aid, as defined in AS 47.10.011; (2) the parent has not remedied the conduct or conditions that placed the child at substantial risk of harm; and (8) OCS has made reasonable efforts, as defined in AS 47.10.086, to reunify the child with the parent. The court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that (4) termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child."
"22. We hold that it was legal error for the superior court to consider only OCS's post-removal efforts in its examination of whether OCS made reasonable efforts. We have stated that ""[the reasonableness of the state's efforts 'must be viewed in light of the entire history of services that the state hals] already provided'"" This history includes both pre-removal and post-removal efforts.
23. Because the superior court made alternate findings based upon the record as a whole, we would normally uphold those alternate findings absent clear error. In this case, however, the findings do not permit effective appellate review. In its two alternative conclusions, the superior court gave significantly different weight to the factors used in deciding whether OCS made reasonable efforts without explaining why the factors were weighted differently. When considering only the post-removal time period, the superior court found that OCS's efforts were reasonable. The court based this decision primarily on Tara's refusal to cooperate. Tt found that notwithstanding OCS's ""dismissive approach,"" OCS's post-removal efforts were reasonable because ""a case plan was actually prepared and provided to [Taral, and . efforts were made to communicate with her,"" but Tara refused to cooperate. When determining that OCS's efforts over the entire history of the case were unreasonable, though, the court based its decision primarily on OCS's lack of effort; it found that Tara's unwillingness to cooperate ""was a factor that the department simply was required to confront"" and that OCS failed to put forth the required sustained effort and follow-through. Because of the unexplained apparent inconsistencies in the weight placed on OCS's efforts and Tara's unwillingness to cooperate, we cannot effectively review the findings regarding reasonable efforts."
"25. The superior court, in its discretion, may take additional evidence to support its factual findings regarding whether OCS made reasonable efforts.
26. The superior court did not clearly err in finding that termination of Tara's parental rights was in the best interests of the children. It was not clear error for the court to find that Tara has not demonstrated an ability to properly care for the girls and that the permanency of an adoptive placement was in the girls' best interests.
27. We VACATE the superior court's order so far as it regarded OC's reasonable efforts and REMAND for additional findings of fact based upon the totality of the cireum-stances.

"OPINION
PER CURIAM.
I. INTRODUCTION
The single issue presented in this appeal concerns the manner in which a noncustodial parent, William Carrick, can satisfy a combination of repayment obligations to the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) and a continuing support obligation to his minor son. The superior court essentially authorized William to pay a portion of these obligations directly to his former wife. The State questions this authorization and asserts that all monies owed by William must be routed through CSED as a matter of law.
II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
Renee Carrick and William Carrick were divorced in October 1989. Renee assumed sole custody of their son. Renee had been receiving public assistance for the support of their son before the divorce and continues to receive support to the present. Subsequently it came to the attention of CSED that William, pursuant to a settlement agreement incorporated into their divorce decree, was not paying child support in accordance with the provisions of Civil Rule 90.3. CSED then filed a motion to require William to reimburse the State for past public assistance and also to modify William's support obligation to bring it in conformity with Civil Rule 90.3. The superior court entered an order on August 5,1994, requiring William to repay the State $3,000 for public assistance payments made to Renee between October 1988 and September 1993. The superior court's order set William's child support obligation at $460 a month commencing on October 1,1993."
"In his initial report, the Master wrote in part:
However, there was insufficient evidence as to how either the VA or Social Security Administration would view a support order
directing the federal agencies to dispense monies in a certain way. The State's power to do that is uncertain. Rather, the more prudent means of dealing with support is for the court to just order Mr. Carrick to pay the $460.00 per month support and for him to arrange payment as best he can.
Thereafter, in response to CSED's motion for clarification, the Master stated in part:
Clarification was sought as to the phrase . "" . for him to arrange payment as best he can."" It means only that however he comes up with the $460.00 per month is his responsibility, but the bottom line is that is what he would owe.
CSED objects to this arrangement, claiming ""that the [$100.00 Veteran's Administration] payment should be routed through the CSED."" CSED asks this court to reverse the superior court and order William to redirect the Department of Veteran's Administration to pay the $100 in veteran's benefits to CSED. Alternatively, CSED requests that William redirect the $100 in veteran's benefits to himself and in turn pay the $100 directly to it each month.
III. DISCUSSION
CSED commences its substantive argument by noting that its entitlement to reimbursement for past and ongoing public assistance paid to Renee is established under State, Child Support Enforcement Division v. Gammons, 774 P.2d 181 (Alaska 1989). CSED also points to AS 47.25.345, which provides that a custodial parent who receives public assistance for a minor child assigns all right to support, from all sources, to the State as a condition of accepting public assistance. CSED next relies on the text of AS 25.27.080(a), which provides that"
"Finally CSED argues that
[t]he state should be able to receive $360 a month from Mr. Carrick and $100 a month from the VA to pay towards the child support debt. When money is routed through CSED, the payments can properly be allocated to Mrs. Carrick and to offset the public assistance paid for Will Carrick. Since the trial court's decision does not require that the payments be routed through CSED, the state is effectively denied reimbursement for public assistance.
CSED needs assistance from the court to reroute the payment of Mr. Carrick's veteran's disability benefits through the agency. The United States Code exempts Mr. Carrick's veteran's benefits from being attached, levied, or seized through any legal process. See 38 U.S.C. § 5301(a). Consequently, CSED cannot attach the veteran's benefits directly.
Unfortunately, CSED has failed to inform this court of the procedural steps by which the custodial parent in this ease obtained the $100 monthly direct payments from the Department of Veteran's Affairs. More importantly, CSED has not apprised this court if there are existing procedures by which the veteran can redirect the monthly $100 payments to CSED or to himself for payments directly to CSED.
Prior to entering an order requiring William to redirect the payments, this court must be satisfied that he has the authority to do so. Based upon the record before us, we are unable to ascertain whether or not this is the case. Therefore, we decline to resolve the specific issue of redirection of the payments at this time."
"Until such time as an adequate showing is made by CSED regarding the feasibility of redirecting the veteran's benefits, the $100 payments shall accordingly be credited against William's $460 per month current obligation. We note, however, that AS 25.27.080(a) does entitle CSED to an order requiring that all payments made by William personally be routed through the agency. The superior court's orders must be modified on remand to reflect this requirement.
IV. CONCLUSION
This case is accordingly REMANDED to the superior court for modification of its support orders and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
FABE, J., not participating.
. CSED formulated the issue before this court as follows: ""Where a noncustodial parent is obligated to repay the state for public assistance paid for the benefit of his child, did the superior court err when it held that the [non]custodial parent's child support obligation could be partially satisfied by payments made directly to the custodial parent?""
. As to child support the settlement agreement states:
The mother currently receives social security payments and payments from the Veteran's Administration. The social security administration and the veteran's administration pays to the wife a dependent's share of the social security and veteran's administration payments. The husband agrees that these payments shall continue and he shall not in any way interfere with them and shall do all things necessary to make sure and certain that the dependent payments from social security and veteran's administration are paid to the wife for the benefit of the minor issue."
". The fact and extent of William's liability to reimburse the State were never appealed. Nor did William appeal the superior court's determination that pursuant to Civil Rule 90.3 his monthly child support obligation is $460.
. A letter from the Department of Veteran's Affairs states the following:
This certifies the records of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) indicate Mr. William R. Carrick has provided payment of $100.00 per month to Renee Carrick, custodian of Will E. Carrick. This $100.00 has been made monthly since November 1, 1989.
Mr. William R. Carrick currently receives a total of [$]1,649.00 from this department, and $100.00 is deducted from the [$] 1,649.00 amount.
5. The superior court subsequently approved both the Master's report and the Master's clarification of his interim report.
. See AS 25.27.120(a), which provides in part:
An obligor is liable to the state in the amount of assistance granted under AS 47.07 and AS 47.25.310 — 47.25.420 to a child to whom the obligor owes a duty of support except that, if a support order has been entered, the liability of the obligor for assistance granted under AS 47.25.310 — 47.25.420 may not exceed the amount of support provided for in the support order, and, if a medical order of support has been entered, the liability of the obligor for assistance granted under AS 47.07 may not exceed the amount of support provided for in the medical order of support.
. AS 47.25.345 reads as follows:
An applicant for or recipient of assistance under AS 47.25.310 — 47.25.420 is considered to have assigned to the state, through the child support enforcement agency, all rights to accrued and continuing support that the applicant and other persons for whom assistance is sought may have from all sources. The assignment takes effect upon a determination that the applicant is eligible for assistance under AS 47.25.310 — 47.25.420. Except with respect to the amount of any unpaid support obligation accrued under the assignment, the assignment terminates when the applicant ceases to receive assistance."
"OPINION
RABINO WITZ, Justice.
This appeal presents the question of whether a person imprisoned for refusal to pay a fine is entitled to ""good time"" reductions to his sentence.
Facts and Proceedings.
Steven K. Murphy was convicted, after a jury trial, of disposing of domestic waste-water on state lands without a permit. He was sentenced to thirty days imprisonment, all of which was suspended, and fined $1,000. After proceedings which were held in conformity with AS 12.55.051(a) the magistrate entered a finding that Murphy intentionally refused to pay the fine despite his ability to do so. As authorized by AS 12.55.051(a), the court sentenced him to imprisonment as follows:
STEVEN K. MURPHY is hereby committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections to serve twenty (20) days. The twenty (20) days are to be served on weekends from 4:00 P.M. Friday to 6:00 A.M. Monday. Defendant will begin weekend service of jail time on January 18, 1985 and serve five (5) consecutive weekends."
"Murphy appeals both the summary judgment and the award of attorney's fees.
1. WAS MURPHY ENTITLED TO A GOOD TIME REDUCTION?
The right to good time reduction is created by statute and does not derive from either the federal or state constitution. Thus, the issue in the case at bar is purely a question of statutory interpretation. ""In accomplishing this task our primary guide is the language used, construed in light of the' purpose of the enactment."" Commercial Fisheries Entry Comm'n v. Apokedak, 680 P.2d 486, 489-90 (Alaska 1984). ""[I]f the language of a statute is unambiguous and expresses the intention of the legislature, it should not be modified or extended by judicial construction."" State, Dep't of Natural Resources v. City of Haines, 627 P.2d 1047, 1049 n. 6 (Alaska 1981).
Alaska Statute 33.20.010 guarantees good time reductions only to prisoners ""convicted of an offense against the state and sentenced to imprisonment."" Thus, the question in this case, as acknowledged by all parties, is whether the failure to pay a fine is ""an offense against the state.""
The term ""offense"" is not defined for purposes of this statute. ""Unless words have acquired a peculiar meaning, by virtue of statutory definition or judicial construction, they are to be construed in accordance with their common usage."" State, Dep't of Revenue v. Debenham Elec. Supply Co., 612 P.2d 1001, 1002 (Alaska 1980); see AS 01.10.040. Failure to pay a fine imposed as a sentence for a criminal conviction is not within the common understanding of the word ""offense."" For example, Black's defines offense: ""A felony or misdemeanor; a breach of the criminal laws."" Black's Law Dictionary 975 (5th ed. 1979). Similarly, Webster's defines the word: ""an infraction of law: crime, misdemeanor."" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged 1566 (1961). Since the failure to pay a fine is not commonly understood as a breach of any criminal law, a misdemeanor or a felony, it is not an ""offense"" within the meaning of AS 33.20.010."
"Murphy argues that the purpose of good time reductions under AS 33.20.010 is best served by granting them to defendants imprisoned for nonpayment of fines. He cites the following statement of purpose:
The credits are said to be in the nature of a payment or reward by the state to the convict for his good behavior, in order to stimulate him to conform to the rules of the institution and to avoid the commission of crimes and misdemeanors during his imprisonment. Such statutes are prompted by the highest motives of humanity, and are generally looked on with favor both by state and federal legislatures.
60 Am.Jur.2d Penal and Correctional Institutions § 222 (1987) (footnotes omitted). It is true that all prisoners, including those imprisoned for nonpayment of fines, would likely be induced to behave well if offered good time reductions, serving the purposes of AS 33.20.010. However, it does not follow that all prisoners are entitled to the benefits of the statute. The statute is explicitly limited to those imprisoned for ""of-fensefs] against the state."" As discussed above, consistent with the common understanding of the word ""offense"" and the legislative purpose of AS 12.55.051(a), imprisonment for nonpayment of fines cannot be brought within the plain language of AS 33.20.010.
II. WAS THE AWARD OF ATTORNEY'S FEES PROPER?
Murphy argues first that fees should not be awarded against him because he is a public interest litigant. See Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. State, 665 P.2d 544, 552-54 (Alaska 1983). The superior court implicitly rejected this argument by awarding fees against him. We affirm the superior court's award of $3,500 in attorney's fees."
"(1) Is the case designed to effectuate strong public policies?
(2) If the plaintiff succeeds will numerous people receive benefits from the lawsuit?
(3) Can only a private party have been expected to bring the suit?
(4) Would the purported public interest litigant have sufficient economic incentive to file suit even if the action involved only narrow issues lacking general importance?
Id. We will review the superior court's evaluation of the litigant's public interest status under the abuse of discretion standard. Citizens for the Preservation of the Kenai River v. Sheffield, 758 P.2d 624 (Alaska 1988).
Assuming that Murphy satisfies the first three criteria, we are of the view that it was not an abuse of discretion for the superior court to find that he was not a public interest litigant because of the fourth criterion.
If Murphy were entitled to good time reductions, he could potentially have been released about 77 hours earlier. Since this time would be on weekends, it would not conflict with his regular job. Thus, it is likely that his compensatory damages would have been quite small. Murphy also sought punitive damages in an unspecified amount. He now claims that these damages would have been at the most ""in the low four figures."" Accordingly, it might appear that Murphy lacked sufficient economic incentive to bring this lawsuit.
However, in our view there are at least two reasons to conclude that the superior court's ruling was not an abuse of discretion on the ground of adequate economic incentive. First, it is reasonable to assume that a court might award large punitive damages in favor of a plaintiff who was held in prison illegally for 77 hours."
"Murphy next argues that the $3,500 fee award was unreasonable because it was out of proportion to the amount of money in controversy. We hold the award was not an abuse of discretion for the following reasons. First, as discussed above, there was potentially a significant amount of money at stake in regard to the punitive damages claim. Sec ond, the City had an important policy to uphold with ramifications beyond the instant case. Finally, the amount of damages and the importance of policies underlying the case are not determinative of the reasonableness of the fees. Civil Rule 82(a)(2) provides:
In actions where the money judgment is not an accurate criteria [sic] for determining the fee to be allowed to the prevailing side, the court shall award a fee commensurate with the amount and value of legal services rendered.
The City sought over $5,000 in actual fees for 58.5 hours of attorney time. The court awarded partial fees of $3,500. Murphy does not contend that the attorneys billed too many hours or charged too high an hourly rate. Under these circumstances, the fees were not unreasonable and the award was not an abuse of discretion.
AFFIRMED.
. Alaska Statute 12.55.051(a) provides:
If the defendant defaults in the payment of a fine or any installment or of restitution or any installment, the court may order the defendant to show cause why the defendant should not be sentenced to imprisonment for nonpayment. If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the default was attributable to an intentional refusal or failure to make a good faith effort to pay the fine or restitution, the court may order the defendant imprisoned until the order of the court is satisfied. A term of imprisonment imposed under this section may not exceed one day for each $50 of the unpaid portion of the fine or restitution or one year, whichever is shorter. Credit shall be given toward satisfaction of the order of the court for every day a person is incarcerated for nonpayment of a fine or restitution."
". Although the sentence purported to be for twenty days, the actual time provided for was only 310 hours, or slightly less than thirteen days. For sentences of thirty days or less, the Department of Corrections converts the number of days to hours. All parties agree that Murphy was required to serve only 310 hours, as provided for by the specific terms of the order, and not the 480 hours he would have had to serve if the twenty-day sentence had not provided for specific hours and days of incarceration.
. At the time Murphy was sentenced and served his time, AS 33.20.010 provided:
Notwithstanding AS 12.55.125(f)(3) and (g)(3), each prisoner convicted of an offense against the state and sentenced to imprisonment, whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed the rules of the institution in which he is confined, is entitled to a deduction from his term of imprisonment of one day for every three days of good conduct served.
Ch. 166, § 17, SLA 1978. The statute was amended in 1986. Ch. 11, § 1, SLA 1986.
. See supra note 1.
. For purposes of Title 11 of the Alaska Statutes, which contains Alaska's criminal law, "" 'offense' means conduct for which a sentence of imprisonment or fine is authorized; an offense is either a crime or a violation."" AS 11.81.-900(b)(33). ""'[C]rime' means an offense for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized; a crime is either a felony or a misdemeanor."" AS 11.81.900(b)(9). ""'[V]iolation' is a noncriminal offense punishable only by a fine, but not by imprisonment or other penalty; ."" AS 11.81.900(b)(56)."
". Finally, Murphy argues that a 1960 New York trial court decision is persuasive. See New York ex rel. Foley v. Dros, 24 Misc.2d 44, 202 N.Y.S.2d 741 (N.Y.Sup.1960). In that case the petitioner was imprisoned for failure to comply with support orders of the domestic relations court. Id. 202 N.Y.S.2d at 742. The court ordered that since he was treated as a criminal prisoner, he was entitled to good time reductions. Id. 202 N.Y.S.2d at 743. The opinion in that case does not analyze the language of any statutes similar to AS 12.55.051(a) or AS 33.20.010, and thus it is not persuasive in this case.
.Murphy, appearing pro se, did not explicitly raise this argument in the superior court. However, in opposing the fee award he asserted that he ""brought this action in good faith and as a citizen to correct a governmental wrong"" and that the case raised ""a matter to concern the courts, the department of corrections, and all citizens."" This court has held that ""the pleadings of pro se litigants should be held to less stringent standards than those of lawyers."" Breck v. Ulmer, 745 P.2d 66, 75 (Alaska 1987), cert. denied, — U.S. -, 108 S.Ct. 1579, 99 L.Ed.2d 894 (1988). For this reason, we believe that Murphy's opposition in the superior court was adequate to assert his status as a public interest litigant.
. This is one-fourth of the 310 hours of his sentence.
. Murphy claims that his compensatory damages would have been only about $150, but this figure did not appear in his complaint or any other pleadings until he was opposing the attorney's fees."
"OPINION
MATTHEWS, Justice.
I. INTRODUCTION
This case involves a news publisher's claim that the Governor and the executive branch are unlawfully withholding documents from the public. The superior court held that the documents were protected by the deliberative process privilege. The publisher appeals that decision, as well- as the superior court judge's refusal to disqualify himself.
II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
The Capital Information Group (CIG) is a news organization that publishes periodicals describing the activities of the Alaska state government. It is owned by Judy Erickson, appellant Gregg Erickson's wife.
Gregg Erickson is the editor of one of CIG's publications, the Alaska Budget Report (ABR). In Erickson's words, ABR covers ""the action of the legislature and the administration on budget spending and revenue, and specifically . cover[s] the activities of the finance committees, OMB, and the governor's office as they relate to the formulation and adoption of the spending and collecting of state money."" During the legislative session, ABR is published weekly; it is published once every two months during the rest of the year. Approximately twenty to twenty-five groups subscribe to ABR, including news and media organizations, government agencies, lobbyists, legislators, corporations, non-profit organizations, and local governments."
"At issue in this ease are two sets of documents. The first set of documents consists of the budget proposals sent from each executive department commissioner to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In the summer of 1998, the Governor began working on his proposed 1995 operating budget. To facilitate this work, OMB director Shelby Stastny sent to the commissioner of each state department a memorandum which stated:
[E]ach department's [fiscal year 1995 (""FY 95"") ] operating budget will reflect the funding level set early in the budget process. To develop this level for FY 95, the Governor will provide each commissioner with an allocation. You will then prepare a memorandum in which you will discuss the programmatic impact the allocation will have on services which the department is providing this current fiscal year. In addition, the memorandum should briefly discuss any potential legislation which could be important in meeting the department's FY 95 obligations.
The second set of documents contains each department's proposals for new legislation sent to the Governor's Legislative Liaison. During the summer of 1993 the Governor was also preparing the legislation he would introduce during the 1994 legislative session. To facilitate this, his Legislative Liaison, Kris Lethin, sent each department commissioner a letter requesting proposals for legislation.
Erickson, after learning of Stastny's request, wished to examine the correspondence from each department commissioner to OMB regarding the budget. He also requested from Lethin the legislation proposed by each department commissioner. When his verbal requests went unanswered, Erickson made a written request for this information. Both Stastny and Lethin, on the advice of the Department of Law, denied Erickson's requests. Stastny provided Erickson with the letter he sent each commissioner, and the spreadsheet used to provide each department with an initial budget target. He claimed all other documents regarding the budget were protected by the deliberative process privilege. Lethin also claimed that all documents pertaining to proposed legislation were protected by the deliberative process privilege."
"Shortly after its motion for a preliminary injunction was denied, CIG filed a motion requesting Judge Pegues to disqualify himself under Alaska Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3C(l)(a) and (b). Judge Pegues denied this motion, as did Judge Thomas M. Jahnke upon review under AS 22.20.020(c).
The court entered an order requiring that the State submit the records requested by CIG. The State submitted the documents for in camera review. The State and CIG then filed cross-motions for summary judgment, although CIG's motion was only for partial summary judgment, reserving the issue of damages. The superior court granted the State's motion for summary judgment based on the deliberative process privilege, and denied CIG's cross-motion for partial summary judgment. CIG appeals both the summary judgment order and Judge Pegues's refusal to disqualify himself.
III. DISCUSSION
A. Did the Superior Court Err in Finding that the Documents in Question Were Protected by the Deliberative Process Privilege?
1. The Alaska public records statute
Alaska's public records statute, AS 09.25.100-220, states that, ""[ujnless specifically provided otherwise, the public records of all public agencies are open to inspection by the public under reasonable rules during regular office hours."" AS 09.25.110(a). The statute also states that ""[ejvery person has a right to inspect a public record . except . (4) records required to be kept confidential by a federal law or regulation or by state law."" AS 09.25.120(a).
In the most recent amendment to the statute, the legislature added a legislative findings and intent section. The legislature stated that ""public access to government information is a fundamental right that operates to check and balance the actions of elected and appointed officials and to maintain citizen control of government."" Ch. 200, § 1, SLA 1990."
"2. The deliberative process privilege
The deliberative process privilege ""is a widely recognized confidentiality privilege asserted by executive officials. It rests on the ground that public disclosure would deter the open exchange of opinions and reeommendations between government officials _[and] is intended to protect the executive decision-making process, its consultative functions, and the quality of its decisions."" Natalie A. Finkelman, Note, Evidence and Constitutional Law, 61 Temp.L.Rev. 1015, 1033 (1988).
This court has never explicitly adopted the deliberative process privilege by that name. We have, however, accepted the ""executive privilege"" articulated in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), which encompasses the same policy concerns. Doe, 721 P.2d at 622-23. This privilege ""recognizes that a chief executive has a qualified power to keep confidential certain internal governmental communications so as to protect the deliberative and mental processes of deci-sionmakers."" Id. Thus, the term ""executive privilege"" in Doe encompasses what other commentators have called the deliberative process privilege. We consider the terms to be synonymous for purposes of this discussion.
The origin of the deliberative process privilege can be summarized as follows:
The deliberative process privilege itself can be directly traced to 'two relatively recent decisions. In 1938 the Supreme Court protected the mental processes of government decisionmakers in Morgan v. United States [304 U.S. 1, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129 ]. Then, in 1958 Justice Reed built on Morgan when, sitting on the Court of Claims by designation, he decided Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. United States [141 Ct.Cl. 38, 157 F.Supp. 939 ]. Justice Reed considered in Kaiser whether internal government documents must be disclosed. He recognized the need for open, frank discussions among government officials about proposed or contemplated action. He believed disclosure of official deliberations would inhibit those discussions, invade the mental processes of government officials, and adversely affect the quality of administrative decisionmaking. Accordingly, he held that a document containing deliberative process information was privileged and need not be disclosed."
"A limited deliberative process privilege, labeled the ""executive privilege,"" was adopted by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974). Unlike the common law based deliberative process privilege discussed above, the executive privilege in Nixon was deemed constitutionally required by the separation of powers doctrine. The Court explained the privilege, and its constitutional underpinnings, by stating:
The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence, like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations, for example, has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to those values, is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decisionmaking. A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately. These are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications. The privilege is fundamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.
Id. at 708, 94 S.Ct. at 3107. Notwithstanding this strong language, the Court held that the privilege was limited, and that the information would not immediately become public, but would be produced ""for in camera inspection with all the protection that a district court will be obliged to provide."" Id. at 706, 94 S.Ct. at 3107."
"Brown and other doctors identified in the newsletter sued the anti-abortion organization for defamation. As part of discovery, the doctors requested the Governor's ""appointment file"" which contained letters and telegrams received by the Governor, the Governor's responsive letters, and miscellaneous internal memorandum and papers. Id.
In deciding Doe, we first noted that exceptions to the public records statute's disclosure requirements are to be construed narrowly. Id. at 622. We then adopted the executive privilege as a privilege required under the Alaska Constitution's Separation of Powers Doctrine, stating: ""We . conclude that the public policy rationale upon which the Supreme Court relied in United States v. Nixon is equally applicable to our state government."" Id. at 623. We addressed the letters from private citizens and the internal memoranda and papers separately in light of the privilege.
Regarding the citizen letters, we noted that most state courts only restrict public access to ""internal communications stating the opinions and recommendations of state employees, or information directly solicited by government officials."" Id. at 625 (emphasis in original). We followed this rule because ""[i]n such cases the rationale underlying the executive privilege doctrine — the need to encourage candid opinions and debate among government officials during the decision-making process — is directly applicable."" Id. In contrast, we held that the rationale underlying executive privilege did not apply to citizens' letters and such letters were not protected. Id."
"On remand, the government was instructed to ""specifically identify and describe the documents sought to be protected and explain why they fall within the scope of the executive privilege."" Id. at 626. The party seeking disclosure would then have to show that ""the need for production outweighs the interest in confidentiality."" Id.
Authorities generally agree upon the substantive requirements of the deliberative process privilege. Initially, since we are concerned with protecting open and free discourse among governmental decisionmakers, the communication at issue must be predeci-sional to be protected. Doe, 721 P.2d at 624 n. 10 (citation omitted). See also Senate of Puerto Rico v. United States Dep't of Justice, 823 F.2d 574, 585 (D.C.Cir.1987); Weaver & Jones at 290-95. Postdecisional com munications are not protected; however, a predeeisional communication does not automatically lose the privilege after the decision has been made, for fear that even disclosure of past communications could harm future deliberations. Weaver & Jones at 290-92. Each case must be considered independently and on its own merits. Id. at 292.
The second requirement for the privilege to attach is that the communication be "" 'deliberative' in nature, reflecting the 'give- and-take' of the deliberative process and containing opinions, recommendations, or advice about agency policies."" Doe, 721 P.2d at 624 n. 10 (quoting Paisley v. C.I.A., 712 F.2d 686, 698 (D.C.Cir.1983), vacated in part on other grounds, 724 F.2d 201 (D.C.Cir.1984)). See also Senate of Puerto Rico, 823 F.2d at 585; Weaver & Jones at 296. Concomitant with this requirement, purely factual material is not protected, and must be disclosed unless ""the manner of selecting or presenting those facts would reveal the deliberative process, or if the facts are 'inextricably intertwined' with the policymaking process."" Paisley, 712 F.2d at 699 (citations omitted); see also Weaver & Jones at 297."
"Once the court determines that a document is privileged, it must still determine whether the document should be withheld. Unlike some other branches of the executive privilege, the deliberative process privilege is a qualified privilege. Once the agency demonstrates that documents fit within it, the burden shifts to the party seeking disclosure. It must demonstrate that its need for the information outweighs the regulatory interest in preventing disclosure.
Weaver & Jones at 315 (citations omitted).
We have previously outlined the balancing test that must be performed when a person seeks records under the public ree-ords statute in the face of executive officials' claims of secrecy. In City of Kenai v. Kenai Peninsula Newspapers, Inc., 642 P.2d 1316 (Alaska 1982), we stated:
In general, questions such as these require a balance to be struck between the public interest in disclosure on the one hand and the privacy and reputation interests of the affected individuals and the government's interest in confidentiality, on the other. The process of balancing has been described as follows:
In determining whether the records should be made available for inspection in any particular instance, the court must balance the interest of the citizen in knowing what the servants of government are doing and the citizen's proprietary interest in public property, against the interest of the public in having the business of government carried on efficiently and without undue interference.
In balancing the interests referred to above, the scales must reflect the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the public records as contrasted with the incidental right of the agency to be free from unreasonable interference. The citizen's predominant interest may be expressed in terms of the burden of proof which is applicable in this class of cases; the burden is cast upon the agency to explain why the records sought should not be furnished. Ultimately, of course, it is for the courts to decide whether the explanation is reasonable and to weigh the benefits accruing to the agency from non-disclosure against the harm which may result to the public if such records are not made available for inspection."
"This ""balancing test"" was articulated in the absence of any official assertion of a delibera- five process privilege. But the balancing test as described goes a long way toward accomplishing the goals of the qualified privilege. If the government does not make a justifiable claim to confidentiality, then the balance will almost certainly tip in favor of the individual seeking the information. If it does make such a claim, and meets the threshold requirements, then there is a presumptive privilege and the party seeking disclosure must make a sufficient showing that the need for production outweighs the need for secrecy. Doe, 721 P.2d at 626. The deliberative process privilege affects the balance described above primarily by identifying more specifically what interest the government may have in maintaining confidentiality, in the form of the threshold showing that the communication is predecisional and deliberative. It also outlines fairly rigid procedural requirements -that the government must meet in order to claim the privilege. See Doe, 721 P.2d at 626.
Thus, the balancing test that a court should perform where a presumptive privilege attaches is that of City of Kenai, If the privilege attaches, however, instead of there being a presumption in favor of disclosure, with doubtful cases being resolved by permitting public inspection, see City of Kenai, 642 P.2d at 1323, there is a presumption in favor of nondisclosure and the party seeking access to the document must overcome that presumption."
"CIG's points on appeal and brief ask for disclosure of two specific types of documents. First, ""[r]ecords in the form of legislative proposals recommended by the various departments and agencies of the state for introduction by the Governor."" Second, ""memoranda prepared by the heads of various agencies and departments of state government for and generally at the request of the director of the Office of Management and Budget regarding the potential impacts of various budget proposals.""
a. Legislative proposals
The first set of documents CIG seeks are legislative proposals sent directly to.the Governor. The legislative proposals were clearly predecisional. The Governor requested them to aid him in deciding what legislation to propose to the legislature; the decision was his. CIG's claim that they were not predecisional because they were each agency's final decision is without merit. See Bureau of Nat'l Affairs v. United States Dep't of Justice, 742 F.2d 1484, 1497 (D.C.Cir.1984) (agency proposals predecisional where final decision is President's).
Second, the proposals were deliberative. CIG argues that they are not deliberative because they ""do not memorialize any debate or discussion between members of the Governor's staff, or between the Governor and his chief advisors, but rather constitute reports made by the agencies to the Governor's office upon request."" As such, CIG claims they are not ""in the nature of internal give-and-take recommendations between decision-makers that would be potentially subject to the deliberative process privilege."""
"Finally, because the threshold requirements have been met (the material is prede-cisional and deliberative), we must weigh the ""interest of the citizen in knowing what the servants of government are doing . against the interest of the public in having the business of government carried on efficiently and without undue interference."" City of Kenai, 642 P.2d at 1323.
The State argues that the need for carrying out business without undue influence is controlling. The State asserts:
The governor must have the ability to obtain completely frank and candid advice from his cabinet and advisors; he must have the opportunity to evaluate ideas and fully consider their policy implications before he decides which of them will and which of them will not become part of his legislative . proposals. In this give-and-take of the deliberative process, the governor must be ""uninhibited by the danger that his tentative but rejected thoughts will become subjects of public discussion."" Doe, 721 P.2d at 624, (citing Cox, Executive Privilege, 122 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1383, 1410 (1974) (footnote omitted)).
In response, CIG argues that
[a] review of the proposed legislation, and particularly bills that were not introduced, would shed light on the needs of the agencies and might, in fact, generate valuable legislative debate or additional legislative proposals.
On the other hand, the public's need to protect the candor of its officials is almost non-existent with respect to the documents sought in this ease. Would agencies be reluctant to submit the legislative proposals if they knew the proposals would be made public? Hardly. In fact, just the opposite is the case: the agencies actually hope that their proposals will become public as part of the Governor's legislative package."
"b. Budget impact memoranda
The second set of documents CIG seeks are the budget memoranda sent from each department head to OMB in response to OMB's request. Alaska Statute 37.07.050 requires such a report. The statute also states:
All goals and objectives, plans, programs, estimates, budgets, and other documents forwarded to the office of management and budget by a state agency under this section are public information after the date they are forwarded.
AS 37.07.050(g).
We believe that the budget impact memoranda at issue here meet the threshold requirements for the privilege. They are predecisional because they were submitted before the Governor made his final determinations as to his proposed budget. See Bureau of Nat'l Affairs, 742 F.2d at 1497 (agency budget recommendations predecisional because President decides what requests to submit to Congress). They are deliberative because they were meant to be, and clearly were, a ""direct part of the deliberative process,"" in allowing the Governor to hear the needs and opinions of each of the agencies which need to be accommodated in the budget. See Weaver & Jones at 296 (listing ""an agency's budget request submitted to the Office of Management and Budget"" as example of deliberative communication).
Since the documents are predecisional and deliberative, we would normally proceed to question whether the demonstrated need for disclosure outweighs the government's interests in confidentiality. However, in this case, the legislature has already weighed those' interests, and resolved them in favor of public disclosure. AS 37.07.050(g)."
"The legislature cannot, by adopting a statute, negate the executive's deliberative process privilege. That the legislature serves as a representative of the public interest does not mean that it can define and limit the parameters of this constitutional privilege or the Governor's constitutional budgetary powers in any way it chooses.
The superior court accepted this position. We do not wholly agree.
The deliberative process privilege has never been held to be absolute. The strongest indication of its constitutional roots has come from the Nixon case, in which the United States Supreme Court recognized a qualified presumptive privilege ""inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution."" 418 U.S. at 708, 94 S.Ct. at 3107. But the very holding of that ease was that the executive privilege, even though constitutionally rooted, was not absolute and may be outweighed by the legitimate needs of a coordinate branch:
In designing the structure of our Government and dividing it and allocating the sovereign power among three co-equal branches, the Framers of the Constitution sought to provide a comprehensive system, but the separate powers were not intended to operate with absolute independence.
Since we conclude that the legitimate needs of the judicial process may outweigh Presidential privilege, it is necessary to resolve those competing interests in a manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch.
418 U.S. at 707, 94 S.Ct. at 3107. Thus we believe it is not sufficient to say that because the deliberative process privilege has constitutional underpinnings the legislature may never enact a statute which has the effect of overriding the executive's request for secrecy."
"The failure of the statute to affirmatively mention ""impact memoranda"" does not alter the analysis. The legislature clearly contemplated that there would be variations in OMB's requests to the agencies when it made public ""[a]ll goals and objectives, plans, programs, estimates, budgets, and other documents forwarded"" to OMB. AS 37.07.050(g) (emphasis added). The executive branch cannot avoid the disclosure requirements of subsection (g) by asking for the agencies' response to a proposed budget instead of for an estimated budget for the coming year.
We hold that the budget impact memoran-da should have been disclosed.
B. Did Judge Pegues Err in Not Disqualifying Himself From the Case ?
CIG argues that Judge Pegues should have disqualified himself from hearing this ease because, as an Assistant Attorney General, he advised then-Governor Hammond that parts of AS 37.07.050 might have been unconstitutional. CIG claims this vio lates Canon 3C(1) of the Alaska Code of Judicial Conduct, which states that judges should disqualify themselves if their ""impartiality might reasonably be questioned"" because they have ""a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts"" or ""served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.""
The document CIG references to support its claim is a 1978 letter to Governor Hammond from Attorney General Avrum M. Gross. The portion of the letter CIG cites apparently advises the Governor as to whether he should support the passage of AS 37.07.050. The letter states, in part:"
"CIG also claims that Judge Pegues ""likely gained personal knowledge of disputed evi-dentiary facts.""
Judge Pegues denied CIG's motion for disqualification. In his memorandum discussing his denial, Judge Pegues stated:
My association with the Department of Law ended more than a decade ago. It is unlikely in the extreme that I possess any personal knowledge about any evidence that may be placed in dispute in this cause. My expertise does not fall in that area but rather in an overall knowledge of the process of the government of the State of Alaska and the law applicable to it. No appearance of impropriety can arise from that.
Judge Jahnke affirmed Judge Pegues's denial. Regarding the claim that Judge Pe-gues served as a lawyer on this case, Judge Jahnke pointed out that Judge Pegues's connection was old and tenuous:
More that fifteen (15) years before this issue was raised, Judge Pegues was an assistant attorney general and authored a six-page letter to then-Governor Hammond reviewing a bill which contained the public records language that is in dispute in this case. However, the letter contains not one ' word addressing that section of the bill.
Regarding CIG's claim that Judge Pegues had personal knowledge of disputed evidence, Judge Jahnke found that CIG had not ""identified what aspect of Judge Pegues' fund of knowledge is disputed by any party and relevant to the disposition of the case. As such, they have failed to identify any objective facts from which a fairminded person could conclude that an appearance of partiality on Judge Pegues' part exists."""
"IV. CONCLUSION
The superior court's summary judgment in favor of the State is AFFIRMED with respect to the legislative proposals sent to the Governor, and REVERSED with respect to the budget impact memoranda. The denial of CIG's Motion for Disqualification is AFFIRMED. The case is REMANDED to the superior court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
MOORE, C.J., not participating.
. The State's cross-appeal, which argued that the superior court erred in holding the appellant to be a public interest litigant, was dismissed on July 25, 1995, pursuant to the parties' agreement.
. Both parties correctly note that whether a privilege applies is a question of law which this court reviews without deference to the trial court. Jones v. Jennings, 788 P.2d 732, 735 (Alaska 1990).
. We do not address potential distinctions between the two terms in other contexts. See, e.g., 26A Charles A. Wright & Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure § 5680, at 125 (1992) (stating deliberative process privilege has been known by variety of names, including executive privilege); Stephen G. Lee, We Have Ways of Making You Talk: Challenging the Invocation of the Deliberative Process Privilege in Contract Disputes, 40 Fed.B. News & J. 90, 90 (1993) (calling deliberative process privilege a ""form of executive privilege""); Margot O. Knuth, Inspection and Discovery of State Records in Alaska, 4 Alaska L.Rev. 277, 277 n. 3 (1987) (stating most courts use ""executive privilege"" to refer to ""deliberative process privilege"" although ""executive privilege"" may also refer to narrower privilege); Gerald Wetlaufer, lustifying Secrecy: An Objection to the General Deliberative Privilege, 65 Ind. L.J. 845, 845 n. 1 (1990) (describing ""general deliberative privilege"" as having different names, sometimes ""an undifferentiated part of a larger cluster of privileges, usually either the 'executive privilege' or the 'official information privilege' _"" (citations omitted)); Russell L. Weaver & James T.R. Jones, The Deliberative Process Privilege, 54 Mo.L.Rev. 279, 279 (1989) (calling ""deliberative process privilege"" a ""branch of the executive privilege."")."
". CIG questions, in a footnote to the ""Procedural Background"" section of its brief, whether the procedural requirements for the assertion of a privilege, which we outlined in Doe, 721 P.2d at 626, have been met. We hold that the requirements were met. The documents for which the privilege was asserted were submitted under seal to the court for in camera review. The court was also supplied with affidavits by Stastny, Lethin, and Raga S. Elim (the Legislative Liaison subsequent to Lethin), based upon personal examination, specifically describing the documents and their intended use in the Governor's office. These are not the type of conclusoiy affidavits which the courts should guard agahxst. While it is true that the superior court ultimately did not examine the documents submitted under seal, it did examine a memorandum from one department which had been leaked to CIG. This was not error, since an in camera examination of the documents is at the discretion of the trial court judge. See Bureau of Nat'l Affairs, 742 F.2d at 1498. Judge Pegues did not abuse his discretion in determining in camera review to be unnecessary where he had the affidavits and a representative memorandum which had already been made public.
. AS 37.07.050(a) states:
Each state agency, on the date and in the form and content prescribed by the office, shall prepare and forward to the office and the legislative finance division
(1) the goals and objectives of the agency programs, together with proposed supplements, deletions, and revisions;"
"(3)the budget requested to carry out its proposed plans in the succeeding fiscal year, including information reflecting the expenditures during the last fiscal year, those authorized for the current fiscal year, those proposed for the succeeding fiscal year, an explanation of the services to be provided, the number of total positions for all persons employed or under contract by the agency for personal services including those rendered for capital improvement projects, the need for the services, the cost of the services, and any other information requested by the office;
(4)a report of the receipts during the last fiscal year, an estimate of the receipts during the current fiscal year, and an estimate for the succeeding fiscal year;
(5) a statement of legislation required to implement the proposed programs and financial plans;
(6) an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of specific alternatives to existing or proposed program policies or administrative methods.
. See also Archibald Cox, Executive Privilege, 122 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1383, 1407 (1974):
But to demonstrate that the President should not be under an absolute duty to provide any and all information upon any and all occasions falls far short of making out the claim of President Nixon's attorneys that the President must have an absolute privilege upon any and all occasions to withhold whatever he wills. Both law and constitutional practice ought to be capable of recognizing, and making a more delicate adjustment in, the middle ground."
"there are many cases in which Congress has the constitutional authority to institute measures that interfere with the ""effective discharge of a President's powers""_ It is entirely possible, therefore, that the Supreme Court, if squarely confronted with the question, might explain away the assertions in United States v. Nixon or confine them to situations in which there is no applicable legislation.
Id. at 1435.
. We recognize that Bureau of National Affairs reached the opposite conclusion with respect to similar documents. 742 F.2d at 1496-98. There, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the EPA's assessment of its funding needs for the fiscal year were within the deliberative process privilege and could be withheld under FOIA Exemption 5. Id. However, in that case there is no indication that the interagency memoranda were required by any statute which also declared them available for public inspection.
.This power is expressed in article III, sections 22 and 23 of the Alaska Constitution. These sections provide:
SECTION 22. All executive and administrative offices, departments, and agencies of the state government and their respective functions, powers and duties shall be allocated by law among and within not more than twenty principal departments, so as to group them as far as practicable according to major purposes. Regulatory, quasi-judicial, and temporary agencies may be established by law and need not be allocated within a principal department."
"OPINION
SINGLETON, Judge.
Robert G. Blake was convicted by a jury of taking a sow grizzly bear accompanied by cubs in violation of former 5 Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 81.320(2); taking a grizzly bear in a closed season, former 5 AAC 81.320(2); taking an overlimit grizzly, former 5 AAC 81.320(2); taking game in a closed area, AS 16.05.789(a); and misconduct involving weapons in the second degree, AS 11.61.210(a)(1). For misconduct involving weapons, Blake was sentenced to thirty days with twenty days suspended, anu fined $2,000 with $1,000 suspended. For each of the other four charges, he received identical sentences of four months with all but thirty days suspended and an unsuspended $1,000 fine. These sentences were to run concurrent to each other, but consecutive to the misconduct involving weapons sentence. Blake was ordered to donate the value of his weapon, $350, to the Wildlife Safeguard Fund. Blake's hunting license was revoked for three years, and he was placed on probation for five years. Blake therefore received a composite sentence of five months with all but sixty days suspended and a fine of $3,350 with $1,000 suspended. Blake appealed his sentence. We affirmed in part but remanded the case to the trial court in order to permit a hearing on Blake's claim that certain statements were admitted against him in violation of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Blake v. State, Memorandum Opinion and Judgment No. 1509 (Alaska App.1987). Specifically, we asked the trial court to determine: (1) whether Blake was in ""custody"" at the time he made incriminating statements and, if so, (2) whether he made statements in response to an ""interrogation."" On remand, the court did not reach the second determination because it concluded that Blake was not in custody when he made the incriminating statements. Blake appeals. We affirm."
"On June 4, 1985, Blake was employed by the State of Alaska, Department of Transportation, at the Chandalar Road Maintenance Station on the Dalton Highway in Alaska. Blake, in the company of several others, was drinking beer and R & R Scotch on the wooden deck of the station. As the evening wore on, members of the party began target shooting at beer cans. Blake, using a 7mm magnum rifle joined them. He saw a grizzly bear on the mountain side near a rock he had been using as a target. Blake shot the bear. The shooting took place within the five-mile quarter along the Dalton Highway above the Yukon River, where hunting with firearms is prohibited. After the shooting subsided, Blake was found on the mountainside by members of his party. Blake had passed out from intoxication as he climbed towards the bear.
The shooting was reported to the Fish and Wildlife Protection (FWP) office. FWP Officer Don Wilson began investigating the incident. On June 10, 1985, FWP Officers Merrill and Schied stopped Blake at mile post 28 of the Elliott Highway. There is a dispute about the events which occurred from this point. Merrill testified in court that Blake told him that he knew he was being stopped and questioned about the bear. Merrill stated that Blake con sented to a search of his truck. Merrill said he did not place Blake under arrest or restrain him in any way. Merrill also testified that Blake voluntarily gave him a statement without coercion. During the trial, Blake elicited on cross-examination that Merrill had not advised him of his Miranda rights during the conversation. Merrill admitted that he might have told Blake during the conversation that he, Merrill, had received written statements from other people about Blake's shooting of the bear. Merrill also testified that when he stopped Blake, he might have told him that he should write out a statement giving his version of the events."
"(1). Defendant was not in custody at the time he made his initial statements to Officers Merrill and Schied at 28 mile Elliott Highway. The court bases this conclusion upon the following:
(a) The defendant stopped his vehicle voluntarily, simply on a wave from Officer Merrill. There was no chase and no emergency lights were activated.
(b) The meeting between Officer Merrill [and Blake] lasted a short time.
(c) Only two officers were present.
(d) The only questions asked by the officers were whether [the] defendant knew why he had been contacted and whether he would sign a consent to search, which he did.
(e) Defendant arrived at and left the place of questioning in his own vehicle.
(f) Defendant was permitted to leave in his own vehicle and complete a written statement at home.
DISCUSSION
In Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the Supreme Court held that the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of a defendant unless it demonstrates the use of certain procedural safeguards prior to questioning. Id. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. By custodial interrogation, the Supreme Court meant ""questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way."" Id.
In a separate line of cases, the Alaska courts and the federal courts have considered the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution and the comparable provisions of our state constitution which prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures, and have applied those provisions to traffic stops and other investigatory stops. See, e.g. United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981); Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); Ebona v. State, 577 P.2d 698 (Alaska 1978); Coleman v. State, 553 P.2d 40 (Alaska 1976); State v. Moran, 667 P.2d 734 (Alaska App.1983). The Alaska courts have held that a person may not be temporarily seized in the absence of a ""reasonable suspicion that imminent public danger exists or serious harm to persons or property has recently occurred."" See Coleman, 553 P.2d at 46; Moran, 667 P.2d at 735."
"In this case, Blake was proceeding along the highway when he was flagged down by two wildlife protection officers. The trial court found that Blake was not in custody and was not under arrest. It is possible that Judge Zimmerman did not distinguish between custody for Miranda purposes and a seizure for fourth amendment purposes in reaching that conclusion. It is also possible that a finding that Blake was not seized for fourth amendment purposes would not be clearly erroneous, if in fact, Blake felt no compulsion to respond to the officer's actions. Having reviewed the authorities, we have determined that a person who is in custody for fourth amendment purposes, i.e., a person who has been ""seized,"" is not necessarily entitled to ""Miranda warnings."" We will therefore assume that under the circumstances, Blake was ""seized"" for purposes of the fourth amendment. Such an assumption avoids very difficult factual determinations. As the United States Supreme Court has pointed out:
Certainly, few motorists would feel free either to disobey a directive to pull over or to leave the scene of a traffic stop without being told they might do so. Partly for these reasons, we have long acknowledged that ""stopping an automobile and detaining its occupants constitutes a 'seizure' within the meaning of the fourth amendment, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief."" (Citations omitted.)
Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 436-37, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3148-3149, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984)."
"However, [despite the similarity between custodial interrogation and a fourth amendment seizure] we decline to accord talismanic power to the phrase in the Miranda opinion emphasized by respondent. [""A person is entitled to Miranda warnings when taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.""] Fidelity to the doctrine announced in Miranda requires that it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated. Thus, we must decide whether a traffic stop exerts upon a detained person pressures that sufficiently impair his free exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination to require that he be warned of his constitutional rights.
Id. at 437, 104 S.Ct. at 3148-3149. The Court based a negative answer to this question on two considerations. First, traffic and investigatory stops are presumably temporary and brief and thus, do not impose the same coercive pressure on a defendant to speak that interrogation at a police station would impose. Second, traffic and investigatory stops take place in public and thus, the defendant is not isolated from friends, associates, etc., as he or she would be in a ""police dominated"" atmo sphere. 3150. Id. at 437-39, 104 S.Ct. at 3148-3150.
While recognizing the similarities between the test for ""seizure"" and ""custodial interrogation,"" the Alaska Supreme Court has also refused to hold that every fourth amendment seizure triggers a right to Miranda warnings. Waring, 670 P.2d at 366 n. 19. See also Palmer v. State, 604 P.2d 1106, 1111-13 (Alaska 1979) (Rabinowitz, J., concurring) (concluding that a traffic stop falls within the on-the-scene questioning exception to Miranda)."
"OPINION
BURKE, Justice.
Bruce Elder was held in contempt of court and was incarcerated for an indefinite period pending the return of certain funds which he allegedly misappropriated from his brother, Michael Elder. Bruce challenges the propriety of the incarceration order. We reverse.
I
On May 17, 1987, Michael Elder was rendered comatose as a result of an automobile accident. On June 5, Probate Master Kathleen Harrington appointed as Michael's temporary guardian his brother, Bruce Elder.
At the initial guardianship hearing, Bruce indicated that he intended to retain an attorney for the purpose of pursuing Michael's legal remedies in connection with the accident. He later decided, however, to personally settle Michael's claim against the driver of the vehicle involved. On June 8, 1987, Bruce settled on Michael's behalf with Allstate Insurance Co., for $100,000. The same day an account was opened in Bruce's name at United Bank of Alaska (UBA). On June 9, Bruce wrote six checks against the account, disbursing a total of $97,930. The amounts and payees were as follows:
(1) $15,000 to Bruce Elder;
(2) $10,000 to Bruce Elder;
(3) $39,930 to Clifford ""Buzz"" Aldeman, Bruce's father-in-law;"
"(5) $12,500 to Odis Elder, Bruce and Michael's father;
(6) $12,000 to Robert Campbell, a close friend of Bruce and Michael's.
Bruce contends that the foregoing disbursements were made to repay legitimate debts incurred either by Michael personally or by a failed business partnership which Michael and Bruce had formed some years before. Bruce also contends that he was advised by counsel that, as guardian, he was entitled to pay Michael's debts.
On June 10, Ernest Schlereth, who had served as Michael's appointed counsel at the guardianship hearing, learned that Bruce had settled Michael's insurance claim with Allstate. Concluding that such settlement was improper, Schlereth sought, and was granted, a temporary restraining order against both Allstate and Bruce Elder. The order provided in pertinent part:
It is hereby ORDERED that Allstate Insurance Company take immediate steps to stop payment on the check in the amount of $100,000 issued to Bruce D. Elder....
It is also ORDERED that Bruce D. Elder is enjoined from in any way disbursing or cashing the funds of this check and is ORDERED to hand over to the State Trooper serving this order or to bring the same to the Probate Court for registry into the court, and appear at the below hearing date.
The order was to remain in effect for ten days, pending a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction scheduled for June 16, 1987.
Elder was served with the temporary restraining order on the afternoon of June 10. Having already made numerous disbursements from the UBA account, Elder did not produce the requested funds when served with the order. He told the trooper that ""Mr. Schlereth had told him that it was okay to put the money into the bank and pay the bills"", and thus, he did not understand why the temporary restraining order was being issued."
"On June 17, Superior Court Judge Victor D. Carlson issued an order to ""show cause why [Elder] should not be held in contempt of court for failure to abide by the Temporary Restraining Order dated June 10, 1987."" At the June 19 show cause hearing, Elder's counsel informed the judge of Elder's prior actions and argued that Elder had ""accomplished all that [the] order prohibited well prior to receiving notification of that order."" He also informed the court that opposing counsel had been provided with copies of the checks and the names of the persons to whom the funds were paid out. Several of the individuals who had received funds testified. Each stated that the money he received was in payment of a bona fide debt. One of these individuals, Clifford Aldeman, surrendered his $39,930 check to the court on the spot. Elder offered immediate return of the $2,070 remaining in the original account. He also offered to take immediate steps to liquidate the auto he had purchased with his share, and to secure the return of the $8,500 paid to Larry Voelk, who had indicated a willingness to voluntarily release those funds.
Notwithstanding the above, the court concluded that it was appropriate to hold Elder in civil contempt and to imprison him until such time as the remaining funds, some $62,000, were actually returned to Michael's newly-appointed guardian. The judge, in his oral contempt ruling stated:
Mr. Bruce Elder is being taken into custody under civil contempt to be held pending the posting of $62,000 in bonds satisfactory to the court or until he otherwise satisfies all of the requirements of the order which was previously entered. It appears to me that he has acted fast and loose with someone else's money, namely the estate's money. Whether he had authority to make these decisions or not, that is somewhat different than when one fails to abide by their fiduciary duty in handling someone else's money."
"On June 29, 1987, a further hearing was held concerning Elder's incarceration. At this hearing, Elder offered to tender certain additional funds which he had obtained during his incarceration. He also informed the court that he was having difficulty liquidating the $18,000 vehicle he had purchased with his share of the funds, but he offered to tender immediate possession of the vehicle to the Office of Public Advocacy. The tender was refused. The court informed Elder that it was his responsibility to liquidate the assets, and that he would ""get[ ] out of jail when the money's returned."" The court also noted that ""[t]here's no six month limitation on this type of contempt,"" and that Elder would ""be [in jail] until he does what he's supposed to do.""
On August 5, 1987, Elder filed the present appeal and moved for an emergency stay of incarceration pending resolution of this matter. The motion was granted on August 7, 1987.
Since his release from custody, Elder has acquired a job, and has begun making regular payments to the Office of Public Advocacy, Michael Elder's current temporary guardian. He has liquidated the automobile, and has been able to replace approximately 80% of the originally disbursed funds. While some of the third-party payees still refuse to return the funds they received, thus prohibiting immediate return of the entire $100,000, Michael's guardian ad litem and the Office of Public Advocacy now agree that Bruce's current level of cooperation warrants his release from jail."
"Bruce Elder was imprisoned without a jury trial and without any of the traditional procedural protections afforded criminal defendants under the United States and Alaska Constitutions. Consequently, his incarceration is proper only if it qualifies as a sanction based upon civil coercive contempt. See Pharr v. Fairbanks North Star Borough, 638 P.2d 666, 669 (Alaska 1981); Gwynn v. Gwynn, 530 P.2d 1311, 1312 (Alaska 1975).
In Alaska, the court's inherent power to impose sanctions for civil contempt is codified at AS 09.50.050 (emphasis added):
When the contempt consists of the omission or refusal to perform an act which is yet in the power of the defendant to perform, the defendant may be imprisoned until the defendant has performed it.
That the act ordered by the court be ""yet in the power of the defendant to perform"" at the time of his incarceration is perhaps the most fundamental aspect of the civil contempt sanction, and is the primary factor distinguishing this judicial remedy from its criminal counterpart, with the latter's attendant procedural safeguards.
Although we have noted on a number of occasions that inability to comply with the court's order is an ""affirmative defense"" on which the contemnor bears the burden of proof, Johansen v. State, 491 P.2d 759, 766 (Alaska 1971); see also Diggs v. Diggs, 663 P.2d 950, 951 (Alaska 1983); State, Dep't of Revenue v. Oliver, 636 P.2d 1156, 1159 (Alaska 1981), we have also made clear that, once established by a preponderance of evidence, inability to comply is an absolute bar to imprisonment based upon civil contempt. See, e.g., Ryfeul v. Ryfeul, 650 P.2d 369, 375 (Alaska 1982); Johansen, 491 P.2d at 767; see also Hicks v. Feiock, — U.S. -, - n. 9, 108 S.Ct. 1423, 1433, n. 9, 99 L.Ed.2d 721, 735 n. 9 (1988) (""[o]ur precedents are clear . that punishment may not be imposed in a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms of the order""). The reason for such a rule is simple: ""[wjhere confinement cannot serve to accomplish the direct remedial object sought, or where there is no remedial objective left to be achieved, any incarceration — even when designated civil in nature — takes on a clearly punitive character,"" and thus gives rise to the need for procedural protections. Gwynn, 530 P.2d at 1312 n. 6."
"The court could, of course, have ordered Elder to take all reasonable steps to secure release of the disbursed funds from the third-party payees. See Johansen, 491 P.2d at 768-69 (contemnor may be ordered to make a reasonable effort to raise overdue child support). It could also have ordered Elder either to tender immediate possession of the automobile to the guardians or to take reasonable steps to liquidate that asset as soon as possible. In either case, Elder's refusal to comply would have constituted a valid ground for imposing civil contempt sanctions. However, we see no legitimate coercive purpose to be served by imprisoning an individual for failing to perform an act, the completion of which is necessarily dependent upon action by a third party.
In sum, we hold that inability to comply is established, as a matter of law, where the undisputed evidence shows either that the funds or property ordered produced are in the hands of third parties over whom the alleged contemnor has no legal control, or that such funds or property have been converted into some form of asset which the court refuses to accept upon immediate tender. Elder made such a showing here, and, accordingly, the superior court erred in ordering his incarceration without the benefit of a jury trial and without any of the procedural protections available to criminal defendants.
In reaching the above conclusion, we do not mean to suggest that the transference or conversion of court-sought assets is an acceptable means of avoiding lawfully issued court orders. On the contrary, such conduct may give rise to criminal charges ultimately resulting in the contemnor's incarceration for some definite period. Imprisonment for civil coercive contempt, however, must be strictly limited in its application lest it intrude upon those constitutionally guaranteed liberties which the courts are sworn to protect. The imprisonment of an individual pending the return of cash assets which, on the undisputed evidence, he no longer personally possesses, crosses the boundaries of acceptable judicial action."
". Bruce testified that he had ""talked to several attorneys"" who advised him to settle the case without ""pay[ing] a percentage"" to an attorney since the maximum he could ever hope to recover was $100,000, the limit under the applicable insurance policy.
. Of the $25,000 which Bruce disbursed to himself, $18,345 was almost immediately reinvested in an automobile purchased from a local auto dealership.
. The money paid to Robert Campbell and Odis Elder was in payment of alleged personal debts incurred by Michael. The other third party payees received their funds in repayment of loans allegedly made to ""Elders Diversified Services,"" the now-defunct snowplowing business started by the two brothers some years ago. Of the funds which Bruce disbursed to himself, $15,000 was in repayment of loans Bruce had made to the partnership, and $10,000 was for the 10% ""legal fee"" which he was allegedly advised that he could pay himself for handling Michael's affairs.
. Schlereth took the position that any settlement which did not involve thorough consultation with an attorney violated Elder's duties as guardian/conservator and was thus unauthorized.
. The master also (1) terminated Elder's temporary guardianship, (2) made the earlier Temporary Restraining Order a preliminary injunction, and (3) expanded the scope of the order to require that Bruce
take immediate steps to retrieve funds and turn into the registry of the court from said insurance proceeds, which may have been disbursed, and provide immediate information, through his attorney to the guardian ad litem, as to the specific distribution of said funds, providing names and numbers of accounts, amounts deposited, and persons to whom funds were given."
". On the same day, the court issued a temporary restraining order directing UBA to place holds on all accounts into which portions of the $100,-000 may have been transferred.
. Elder was unemployed at the time of his incarceration.
. A criminal contempt proceeding involving the threat of incarceration is a ""criminal prosecution"" within the meaning of the Alaska Constitution, State v. Browder, 486 P.2d 925, 937 (Alaska 1971), and thus entitles the contemnor to full criminal procedural safeguards prior to imprisonment. Johansen v. State, 491 P.2d 759, 766 n. 27 (Alaska 1971).
. Contempt proceedings, like all other ""actions tried upon the facts without a jury,"" are subject to the provisions of Civil Rule 52, requiring that specific findings of fact and conclusions of law accompany the judgment. Alaska R.Civ.P. 52(a). Under this rule, the judgment of the superior court is subject to remand where the court's findings are insufficient to provide the reviewing court with a clear understanding of the basis of the court's decision. See Uchitel Co. v. Telephone Co., 646 P.2d 229, 236 n. 16 (Alaska 1982); Wigger v. Olson, 533 P.2d 6, 7-8 (Alaska 1975); Spenard Plumbing & Heating v. Wright, 370 P.2d 519, 525 (Alaska 1962).
. The record suggests that some or all of the third party checks, though written and delivered prior to issuance of the temporary restraining order, may have actually cleared the bank sometime thereafter.
. The guardian ad litem contends that the funds for the purchase of the automobile were actually delivered to the dealership after the issuance of the temporary restraining order. Such action would likely conflict with the plain wording of the court's order and, if proved, might support a conviction for criminal contempt under AS 09.50.010-.020."
"OPINION
PER CURIAM.
The question presented in this appeal is whether the state Labor Relations Agency's decision allowing the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) to represent a bargaining unit composed of supervisory personnel employed by the Fairbanks Municipal Utilities System was error in light of the fact that IBEW also represents a bargaining unit which consists of rank and file employees of the Utility System. We conclude that there was no error for the reasons expressed in part III of the opinion of the superior court set forth in the appendix."
"APPENDIX
IBEW is currently the exclusive bargaining agent for a unit of rank and file employees of [the Municipal Utilities System (MUS)]. MUS contends that the [Public Employment Relations Act (PERA)] does not permit IBEW to also represent the unit at issue in this case.
The PERA does not itself address the question of dual representation. The [Labor Relations Agency (LRA) ] has long held that since the Act does not prohibit the practice and since the selection of a bargaining representative is a matter of employee choice, dual representation is permissible. LRA Order and Decision No. 8 at 1, 3 (January 17, 1974). This is the sort of question which implicates the LRA's special expertise; the Agency is in a better position than the court to evaluate the impact of dual representation on the collective bargaining process. Therefore, this court will uphold the LRA's action so long as it has a reasonable basis. See Kelly v. Zamarello, 486 P.2d 906, 916 (Alaska 1971).
The legislature has defined the term ""organization"" for purposes of the PERA. AS 23.40.250[4] provides that
""[0]rganization"" means a labor or employee organization of any kind in which employees participate and which exists for the primary purpose of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment and conditions of employment.
There is nothing in the language of this definition which suggests that an otherwise qualified labor organization could not represent two different bargaining units within the same public employer. Indeed, the use of the phrase ""labor organization of any kind"" suggests the contrary."
"It is the public policy of the state to promote harmonious and cooperative relations between government and its employees and to protect the public by assuring effective and orderly operations of government. These policies are to be effectuated by
(1) recognizing the right of public employees to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining;
(2) requiring public employers to negotiate with and enter into written agreements with employee organizations on matters of wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.
AS 23.40.070. The court has said that AS 23.40.070(1) and (2) make a strong statement in favor of public employees' right to organize and bargain collectively. Anchorage Municipal Employees' Association v. Municipality of Anchorage, 618 P.2d 575, 578 (Alaska 1980). The strength of the policy statement led the court in that case to decline to construe another provision of the act in a manner which would interfere with the employees' assertion of those rights. Id.
The particular right at issue here is specifically guaranteed by the PERA. AS 23.40.080 provides that public employees may themselves choose their representative for collective bargaining purposes. The court has said that ""It can no longer be disputed that the right to affiliate with the union of one's choice is the right of the public employee as well as the private employee."" Kenai Peninsula Borough School District v. Kenai Peninsula Borough School District Classified Association, 590 P.2d 437, 439 (Alaska 1979). Furthermore, it has been recognized that associational rights of this character are rooted in the protections afforded by the First Amendment. Id."
"BRYNER, Chief Judge.
Danny J. Harrison was convicted by a jury of two counts of perjury in violation of AS 11.56.200(a). Harrison appeals, contending that Superior Court Judge Larry C. Zervos erred in denying Harrison's motion for a judgment of acquittal. We affirm.
. After being convicted of misconduct involving weapons and theft by receiving, Harrison filed an application for postconviction relief, challenging his convictions. The state moved to dismiss Harrison's application. In reply to the state's motion, Harrison filed a factual statement claiming, among other things, that the police officers who arrested him ""broke his arm and killed his dog."" To this statement, Harrison attached a signed document that he entitled ""Affidavit in Support of Reply to Opposition to Motion for Post Conviction Relief."" Harrison's affidavit attested to the truth of his factual statement:
I,Danny J. Harrison, being duly sworn upon my oath, depose and state the following:
1. That I am Defendant in the above-captioned cause of action.
2. That the representations and allegations made in the Reply attached hereto and referred to herein by reference are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
3. That I have thoroughly read Cr.R. 11 and 35(a) and found nothing in either which overrides the jurisdiction of this Court in this matter.
4. That I firmly believe that once presented the facts, and the positive changes effected by the Defendant since the original sentencing, relief will be justified.
FURTHER AFFIANT SAYETH NAUGHT."

Defendant, Pro se
COMES NOW Danny J. Harrison, pursuant to the provisions of A.S. 09.63.020, and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1746, and declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
EXECUTED on November 12,1993.

Danny J. Harrison
The state eventually discovered that Harrison's factual statements were false: the police neither broke Harrison's arm nor killed his dog. As a result of these false statements, the state charged Harrison with two counts of perjury. At trial, Harrison moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the affidavit upon which his perjury prosecution was based failed to qualify as a ""sworn statement,"" as defined in Alaska's perjury statute. Judge Zervos denied Harrison's motion. On appeal, Harrison renews this argument.
Alaska Statute 11.56.200(a) states that ""[a] person commits the crime of perjury if the person makes a false sworn statement which the person does not believe to be true."" Alaska Statute 11.56.240(2) defines two types of ""sworn statement"":
(A) a statement knowingly given under oath or affirmation attesting to the truth of what is stated, including a notarized statement; or
(B) a statement knowingly given under penalty of perjury under AS 09.63.020.
Harrison contends that his ""affidavit"" did not qualify as a ""sworn statement"" under either of these definitions. Although Harrison's affidavit recited that Harrison had been ""duly sworn upon [his] oath,"" the affidavit did not purport to have been signed before a notary or any other official empowered to administer oaths. No official actually placed Harrison under oath, and no official was present or available when Harrison signed the affidavit."
"The definition of ""sworn statement"" set out in subparagraph (2)(B) incorporates the provisions of AS 09.63.020(a), entitled ""[c]ertifi-cation of documents."" The certification statute states:
A matter required or authorized to be supported, evidenced, established, or prov en by the sworn statement, declaration, verification, certificate, oath, or affidavit, in writing of the person making it (other than a deposition, an acknowledgment, an oath of office, or an oath required to be taken before a specified official other than a notary public) may be supported, evidenced, established, or proven by the person certifying in writing ""under penalty of perjury"" that the matter is true. The certification shall state the date and place of execution, the fact that a notary public or other official empowered to administer oaths is unavailable, and the following:
""I certify under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true.""
In the present case, even though Harrison's affidavit expressly stated that Harrison ""deelare[d] under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct"" — language tracking the form certification required by this statute — the affidavit failed to include another required statement: ""that a notary public or other official empowered to administer oaths is unavailable[.]""
Harrison argues that, due to this omission, his affidavit was not a proper certification under AS 09.63.020, and so did not qualify as a ""sworn statement"" under the definition set out in AS 11.56.240(2)(B), which requires proof of ""a statement . given under penalty of perjury under AS 09.63.020."" Harrison reasons that since his affidavit could not be considered a ""sworn statement,"" it was legally insufficient to support convictions for perjury, which under AS 11.56.200(a), require ""false sworn statement[s]."""
"The guiding principle [of the offense of perjury] is that when the community commands or authorizes certain statements to be made with special formality or on notice of special sanctions, the seriousness of the demand for honesty is sufficiently evident to warrant the application of criminal sanctions. Upon this principle, it makes little difference what formula is employed to set this seal of special importance on the declaration.
Within the same principle, technical irregularities in the administration of an oath should not be regarded as mitigating the offense.
Model Penal Code § 241.1, Commentary at 129-30 (1980).
Mindful of this policy, Alaska's appellate courts have chafed at arguments favoring a narrow interpretation of the term ""sworn statement."" See Anchorage Sand and Gravel Co. v. Wooldridge, 619 P.2d 1014 (Alaska 1980); Knix v. State, 922 P.2d 913 (Alaska App. 1996); Gargan v. State, 805 P.2d 998 (Alaska App.1991).
In Gargan, this court dealt with a perjury conviction involving an affidavit that purported on its face to be sworn before a notary. Evidence at trial established that the notary had not actually placed Gargan under oath. We nevertheless affirmed Gargan's perjury conviction, observing that, for purposes of determining whether a sworn statement had been made, the crucial issue was not whether an oath was actually given, but rather whether the statement amounted to ""a verification on its face of the truthfulness of the facts contained therein."" Gargan, 805 P.2d at 1005."
"Gargan and Knix dealt with notarized statements and thus addressed the definition of ""sworn statement"" set out in AS 11.56.240(2)(A). In contrast, Harrison's case involves an unnotarized statement purportedly certified under penalty of perjury; thus we address the definition of ""sworn statement"" set out in subparagraph (B) of the same statute. Nevertheless, the policies we invoked in deciding Gargan and Knix apply with equal force to Harrison's case.
When a false statement pertaining to an important matter is sworn, affirmed, or certified, the resulting evil is the likelihood that the statement's formal assertion of truthfulness will be honored and relied upon. This is the evil the perjury statute seeks to prevent. Hence, the pertinent question in Harrison's case is not whether Harrison's omission of a formally required phrase could conceivably cause his affidavit to be rejected on technical grounds in some situations; rather, the question is whether the affidavit, despite this omission, manifests Harrison's intent to formally declare the truthfulness of the affidavit's factual assertions, so that reasonable persons would be expected to honor and act on them.
Despite its failure to expressly state that no notary was available, Harrison's affidavit declared that it was made under penalty of perjury ""pursuant to the provisions of AS 09.63.020."" By including this language, the affidavit in effect incorporated by reference and implicitly professed compliance with the requirements of the certification statute."
"Harrison's conviction is AFFIRMED.
. In Gargan v. State, 805 P.2d 998 (Alaska App. 1991), we affirmed a perjury conviction based on an affidavit that was signed before a notary, even though the notary did not actually administer an oath. We found the affidavit to be a sworn statement under subparagraph (2)(A) because it purported on its face to have been given under oath. The complete absence of a notary or other official empowered to administer oaths arguably distinguishes Harrison's case from Gargan. Our conclusion that Harrison's affidavit qualifies as a sworn statement under subsection (2)(B) makes it unnecessary to consider the state's argument that the affidavit also qualifies as a sworn statement under subsection (2)(A).
. Although the affidavit in Knix incorporated wording of the certification statute by declaring that it was signed ""under penalty of perjury,"" it had in fact been signed before a notary. Accordingly, we found it to be a notarized statement and concluded that it fell within the definition of a sworn statement set out in subparagraph (A) of AS 11.56.240(2). For this reason, we found it unnecessary to decide whether the affidavit might also have qualified as a sworn statement under the definition set out in subparagraph (B) — ""a statement given under penalty of perjury under AS 09.63.020."" Knix, at 915 n.2.
. Cf. Martin v. State, 896 S.W.2d 336, 339 (Tex. App.1995) (""That [an affidavit's] formalities were not met does not negate the existence of the oath; it merely vitiates the use of the instrument as proof that an oath was taken."")."
"OPINION
EASTAUGH, Justice.
We must here consider whether AS 23.30.110(c) time bars Danny Huston's claim for workers' compensation benefits. The Aaska Workers' Compensation Board dismissed Huston's claims as untimely. The superior court affirmed when Huston appealed the Board's decision. We reverse and remand.
I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
Danny Huston injured his lower back while employed by Coho Electric (Coho) in 1984. Agonaut Insurance Company (Ago-naut) then insured Coho. Coho/Agonaut accepted the claim for the 1984 injury and paid Huston temporary total disability benefits. He was released to return to work without restriction.
Huston suffered a second back injury while employed by Coho in 1985. Rockwood Insurance Corporation then insured Coho. (The Aaska Insurance Guaranty Asociation succeeded Rockwood, which has been liquidated.) Coho/Rockwood paid benefits for Huston's 1985 injury, and Huston returned to work for Coho.
On May 28, 1987, Huston filed an application for adjustment of claim (""first application""), requesting permanent partial disability (PPD), temporary total disability (TTD), vocational rehabilitation and medical benefits. The application was based upon both the 1984 and 1985 injuries. Coho and its insurers answered the application, denying all claims, on June 24, 1987. On November 14, 1988, Huston served and filed an affidavit of readiness for hearing. The affidavit asserted that Huston was prepared for a hearing ""on the issues set forth"" in the first application.
In a subsequent prehearing conference, Huston indicated that he only wished to pursue a hearing regarding the payment of certain outstanding medical costs. However, the Board did not conduct a hearing; following a March 6, 1989, prehearing conference, the Board reported that ""issues before the Board are resolved. Affidavit of Readiness will be rendered inoperative."" The record reveals no objections from any party regarding that statement."
"A hearing on Huston's August 21, 1991, application was held June 19, 1992. At that hearing, Huston requested and was granted a continuance so he could obtain new counsel following withdrawal of his previous attorney. Huston was subsequently examined by a physician who gave him a nine percent disability rating. Through newly-acquired counsel, Huston filed on July 29 and 30,1992, affidavits of readiness for hearing for the 1984 injury and the 1985 injury, respectively. Those affidavits specified that Huston was prepared for a hearing on the issues set forth in the first application dated May 28, 1987; the affidavits made no reference to the second application, dated August 21,1991. At a prehearing conference, Huston stated that the issues to be heard were Huston's claims for PPD, reimbursement for rehabilitation, medical benefits, and attorney's fees. These were among the benefits Huston had requested in the first application.
Coho and Argonaut asked the Board to dismiss Huston's claim as time-barred under AS 23.30.110(c). The Board held that statute barred all of Huston's claims. It reasoned that the statute of limitations began running again on March 6,1989, when Huston agreed at the prehearing conference that the issues before the Board at that time had been resolved and when the Board stated the 1988 affidavit of readiness for hearing ""will be rendered inoperative."" It noted it had held on numerous occasions that when an affidavit of readiness for hearing is rendered inoperative, the limitations statute in subsection 110(c) starts to run again. The Board reasoned that even tolling the two-year time limit for the period between November 14, 1988 (when Huston filed the initial affidavit of readiness for hearing) and March 6, 1989 (when the Board conducted the prehearing conference), Huston's 1992 affidavits were untimely. Thus the Board concluded that the 1987 claim was time-barred."
"II. DISCUSSION
This case turns on statutory interpretation. Accordingly, we review the decision of the Board using our independent judgment. Hood v. State, Workmen's Compensation Bd., 574 P.2d 811, 813 (Alaska 1978). Where the superior court has acted as an intermediate court of appeal, we give its determination no deference. Smith v. Sampson, 816 P.2d 902, 904 (Alaska 1991).
Subsection 110(e) ""requires the employee, once a claim has been filed and con troverted by the employer, to prosecute the employee's claim in a timely manner."" Jonathan v. Doyon Drilling, Inc., 890 P.2d 1121, 1124 (Alaska 1995). See 2B Arthur Larson, The Law of Workmens' Compensation § 78.84, at 15-426.32(58) (1995) (describing similar statutes by which ""a claim may be dismissed for failure to prosecute it or set it down for hearing in a specified or reasonable time"").
Subsection 110(c) was the basis for the Board's dismissal of Huston's claim for benefits requested in his May 28, 1987, application. It held that subsection 110(c) barred Huston's 1987 claims because it concluded that the statute of limitations began running again on March 6,1989, when Huston agreed at the prehearing conference that the issues before the Board at that time had been resolved and when the Board ordered that his initial affidavit of readiness ""will be rendered inoperative.""
Huston argues that the filing of the November 14,1988, affidavit of readiness should have permanently tolled subsection 110(c). We agree that the plain language of subsection 110(c) demands only that the employee request a hearing within two years of the date of controversion; the Board may require no more from the employee. Tipton v. ARCO Alaska, Inc, 922 P.2d 910 (Alaska 1996). The Board may not unilaterally restart subsection 110(e)'s time limit after the employee has timely requested a hearing."
