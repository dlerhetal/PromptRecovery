0,"the performance evaluation process ( pep ) system is now open through friday ,
nov . 17 , for all employees to solicit and provide performance feedback . this
process is powerful . . . if we provide meaningful feedback .
management , when determining performance ratings , participating in prc
meetings , and providing feedback to employees , depends on the comments
received via pep . for the users of pep information to fully understand the
employee  , s performance and the ratings identified , specific comments are
needed to explain each rating , including the overall rating . it ' s most
beneficial to describe specifically what the employee did and why their
action was productive or why it needs improvement .
comments on areas of strength as well as suggesting areas needing improvement
are both important . just as each of us needs feedback and coaching to
improve our skills in sports or other pursuits , we also need to know what and
how we can improve our work skills and behaviors . we all benefit from
constructive feedback .
please actively participate in the year - end pep process and make your input
meaningful .
pep feedback tips :
? provide feedback when requested .
? rate only those skills and behaviors you have observed this year .
? provide specific comments with specific examples .
? indicate performance needs improvement when appropriate .

morning to gather information and develop a plan . this is summarized below .
general information :
premier is a facility we have been using for a few months , located in
franklin park within chicago . we deliver to the facility via railcar , and
ship out via truck . we currently have about 3 . 8 million board feet , valued
at about $ 1 million , in the facility . during the holidays , we began
experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely . we have
been pressing for information , and are hearing rumors that have raised
significant concerns . although enron has not received written notification ,
we learned today that premier notified customers that they would not be
taking in any more products . additionally , we have heard that the owner ,
jeff leske , is closing the facility , and will be going to work for another
reload facility in chicago , reserve marine terminal ( rmt ) . we have been in
negotiations with rmt for a long term arrangement , and much of the
information we have obtained is through our contact there . in fact , we have

the final candidates are steve stock , everett plant , and as possible late entry john paskin ( although he doesn ' t know this yet and i have him tagged to run corporate systems ) . from a collaboration perspective i am leaning towards stocky . we have all spoken with everett and are impressed with his ' gloss ' . i ' m just not sure he is the right person to give the ' crown jewels ' to , my gut tells me he is good at managing up , but may not be the best collaborative team member ( and i need that ) .

0,"note : fyi , we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term .
ferc limits public access to pipe , transmission maps
amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities , the federal energy regulatory commission is limiting the public ' s access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines .
in a statement of policy , the commission said it would "" no longer make available to the public "" maps of these energy facilities through the internet , the records and information management system ( rims ) and the public reference room at its headquarters in washington , dc .
persons wishing to view the maps , however , can make requests under the freedom of information act ( foia ) at the commission . ferc staff has been urged to "" respond timely to legitimate requests "" for such documents .
the commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days . the move by ferc was not as drastic as some federal agencies , such as the nuclear regulatory commission , which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution .
given the anthrax scares on capitol hill and elsewhere , a spokeswoman said the commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages ."

another item : i got a call from stephen thome in ena who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on enrononline . jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop - up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets . i ' m told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle , so to speak . i think it fits well for the turbines , but i wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development .

0,ignacio some one have tested this in a gfs escapenumber escapenumber san i haven't heard of anyone testing with gfs yet but i would really like to hear of any results we can perform some test but i have some concern about dlm locking and the fcntl range locking i don't know if these works together the samba ctdb code has its own built in dlm used for the distributed databased in clustered samba for user data you can enable disable posix fcntl locking calls using the usual samba method of setting posix locking yes no so it doesn't matter what distributed locking system gfs uses is it possible use a load balance hardware for distribute load among nodes yes and it's probably a very good idea the basic samba ctdb setup presents a system that looks very much like a single multi homed box if you want it to appear as a single ip address then a load balancing switch would be ideal we haven't tested with that setup yet but it should work very well please let us know how it goes cheers tridge

0,we're most of the way through the implementation of pdd escapenumber but still have a few final steps before it can completely replace the current implementation much of the current implementation of oo lives in src objects c and src ops object ops much of the code is specific to the parrotclass parrotobject way of doing things to finish off the implementation we can either branch rip out the old implementation and reintegrate the big thud approach as chromatic would call it or we can refactor the existing ops and supporting code to support the old and new metamodels and when both are passing all the tests we can switch 'newclass' over to creating new style classes by default in this case my preference is the refactor approach we need to support multiple class object implementations anyway refactoring to support the two we have now moves us closer to our goals than simply replacing the old implementation running two implementations will also force us to respect encapsulation boundaries much more than the current implementation does any concerns existing uses of oo code shouldn't be affected until we make the switch of 'newclass' creating new classes by default i suspect pge and tge are our heaviest users of the current object implementation and will act as the best stress test allison

0,"daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . than"
