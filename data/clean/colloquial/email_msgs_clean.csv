0,"just a reminder - timesheets need to be approved by 10 : 00 a . m . on tuesday ,
february 15 . this is necessary in order to meet the payroll deadline of
exporting time to eta ( the corporate payroll system ) , which is noon on
wednesday , february 16 . any timesheets that are not approved by the 10 : 00
tuesday deadline will automatically be approved by the energy operations
timesheet coordinator .
fyi - for the payroll period ending 1 / 31 , there was only 1 timesheet
outstanding at the established deadline . in the past , there have been as
many as 100 ( which represents a little more than 25 % of the energy operations
headcount ) . thanks for your help and support . i know that the assistants
all appreciate your help in meeting this deadline .
a lot of you may not be affected by project hurricane . if you don ' t know
anything about it , then you probably aren ' t affected by it ! in any event , we
have set up 2 new e - work orders in the org database for project hurricane .
they are as follows :
e - hurr ( should be used to capture all time spent on the ongoing support for
project hurricane )
e - hset ( should be used to capture all set - up costs )
both of these work orders are set up and can be used for the 2 / 15 pay
period . however , the following steps must be taken for your employees to use
the ates system and code their time to these work orders :
managers - identify employees within your rc that will need to charge time to
either or both of these work orders . please let your assistants know who
these employees are .
assistants - based on the information you receive from your managers , you
must add 1 or both of the work orders to each employee ' s profile in the org
database so that they are able to charge time to the work order in ates .
assistants - for each time site you are responsible for , you must be sure to
add this information to eta . if you aren ' t sure how to handle this , please
contact kim perkins asap at x 3 - 5304 .
thank you in advance for your cooperation in getting timesheets processed in
a timely manner . please be sure to share this information with your staff if
you haven ' t already done so . if you have any questions on the timesheets or
the work orders , please contact me at x 3 - 6343 .

0,"folks ,
i have been a bit quiet here since reaching india , primarily because of the
delay in the arrival of the henwood team from australia .
they are finally arriving on sunday , and krishna is joining me in mumbai on
sunday evening itself .
i would like to fix a schedule to have a conference call with you on the data
and the type fo questions that you all would like to ask .
stinson - could you please tell me what time would be a good one for you all
to hae a confernce call , but not earlier than monday evening , india time
( monday morning houston time ) . please jot me a note on what would be a good
time for the call .
i will work out an agenda for the call . primarily , it will be discussion of
the data and on what runs we should do to begin with .
another key part of this will be the rate case that mseb is filing , because
this will determine what wil be mseb ' s paymet capability in 2001 / 02 . this is
critical for us . we have our in - house expert who has been working on this
for some time now , and he will also present some of the material on that call .
regards ,
sandeep .
ps : : i am forwarding the basic data that henwood has sent to the whole team
so that you have an opportunity to look at it , if you havent already got it ."

shona
thanks for the meeting yesterday - i think the process does improve the
transparency and accountability of issues raised .
after the call i mentioned to ted that the meetings might be ' more efficient '
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on ' point ' for the
office / business - in this case marcelo . ted replied that no harm came from
the current approach and to a certain degree i agree that it is good to get
an immediate collective response to issues raised ! however , i thought we
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the ' how to do a
doorstep review ' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their
individual reviews next year ) - will call later
additionally , i thought i would confirm with you the actions i took down
marcelo and yourself to identify / communciate the specific control concerns
identified that were not part of the core tasks transfered
marcelo to add these to existing process efficiencies ( such as systems
improvements etc ) and give a full timeline for all ' doorstep ' issues
tim to send details of outward bound commercial instructions and to validate
that no specfic exceptions have been recorded to date .
marcelo to validate that no existing business activities conflict
systematically with the above instructions
all to prepare for full ny review so as to validate compensating controls
exist and function in ny
marcelo / me to identify if any cultural issues are left from recent business
communications on roles and responsibilities
myself to ensure that doorstep issues are included within database and
monitoring process ( on timelines ) happens
will call later

attached is the customer priority list .
this is intended to be the "" pre - approved "" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes us and canadian entities in gas and power .
i have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names . if individual legal names are needed , let me know - i can provide the list that way as well .
note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit . it appears a number of canadian companies some non - online companies were not included in the original list . this most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them .
i will be sending another list later , which will identify the type of master agreement priority for each ( isda , physical gas , physical power )

delano is prescheduled to return from their outage beginning he 7 on monday , 7 / 23 . however , if you can buy the energy back he 7 - 10 , below $ 40 ( their variable costs ) , please do so . if prices warrant , you will purchase 25 mw , spl 5 , he 7 - 10 . i will tee up delano for this play , please stay in contact with the control room to let them know what ' s going on .
as far as the price goes , we proposed to delano that we would split the profit with them . so , split the delta between what you ' re able to buy for , and their variable costs ( $ 40 ) . for example , if you ' re able to purchase the energy at $ 30 , put in a purchase from whoever at $ 30 , then a sale to delano at $ 35 ( giving delano $ 5 , and real - time $ 5 ) . the services desk ( out of the goodness of our hearts ) , is not going to take anything from this transaction .
we have one more issue with delano on monday . he 23 - 24 they are prescheduled at 20 mw , but they will be able to produce 30 mw , so we will possibly have 10 mw to sell for them . they are going to let me know what they want to do . they will either have us sell it real - time , run uninstructed against the iso dec . , or ramp down their generation to reflect their preschedule .
i will keep you posted on what they want to do .

i am having trouble with 8 / 00 . the first issue is day 1 of the purchase at
fuels cotton . we have two deals in sitara , spot deal 348951 and exchange
deal 157288 . you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing . since there was a
spot deal , we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951 . duke says that
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at
gd - 0 . 10 . the exchange deal is currently price at index - 0 . 05 . please let
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be .
the second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8 / 00 . duke is telling
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7 th , which we see , but that we are
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th for the exchange . this
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5 th and 6 th and pipeline
shows all of the gas on the 7 th . this is a daily swing meter which
electronically feeds into settlements . we don ' t normally change these
meters . if you intended for us to prorate this gas , i will need your ok . the
emails below are from marta at duke notifying us of the change .

megan can you tell me how you arrived at the price for august 1 ? i do not
know why august 1 would be priced differently than the other days of the
month when we had over deliveries for the fuel cotton valley gas . this is

you requested that i give you a list of things to avoid discussion with abb . we ' ve maintained a reasonably open relationship with abb up to this point , but here are some ( fairly obvious ) things that we should probably steer clear of :
1 . no discussion about fronterra ;
2 . no specifics about the deacero contract , e . g . extension date , cp ' s , etc ; and
3 . no discussion about project credit issues or financing alternatives for the project .
when this abb contingent was here last ( feb 2001 ) , dave and janet essentially indicated that this was an important project to enron , that we were entirely committed to seeing it through and that if it weren ' t for the damn cfe , we ' d already be done , etc . etc . i think if we stick to that line , we ' ll be fine .
if i think of anything else , i ' ll let you know asap .

gas turbines headed for a 50 % meltdown
high natural gas prices , performance issues and higher than expected
maintenance costs , a general economic slowdown and several other key factors

we are working with mark mccoy on getting some things repathed in the
system . it appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in unify
just the deliveries - not sure why ? ? ? ? . we have been paying the suppliers
based on whatever they invoice us for , which typically has been a smaller
number than what we have in unify . also , we have not been able to get a
contact for the allocation statement . in some cases , we get the summary
sheet , but no detail and some months we don ' t get anything at all . do you
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on
a timely and consistent basis ? the contacts on the allocation statements
that we do have are not returning phone calls . i also need to know what was
the beginning balance when we took this on for tenaska ? anything else that
we need from you , i will call you .

0,"accomplishments :
conducted several workshops with eecc and the calme region this week
scheduled workshops with nepco
have identified the needs to be addressed in the nepco workshops and are
arranging appropriate resources
met with the london coe to discuss their status in terms of reporting ( we are
sharing data from workshops )
have made an initial offer to corp hr cost center users to conduct workshops
for them
brought in some ey help to work with the business units to understand the
multiple environments , extraction and analysis tools being used by the
different business units
upcoming :
additional workshops for eecc and esa
identification of the corp groups that would like to have these sessions made
available ( and subjects they would like to cover )
will complete the "" user "" guides with screen prints to give out to all
participants ( step by step instructions , tools , and tips )
finalize the nepco workshops ( mar 20 - 22 )
produce a plan for upcoming workshops for eccs and design review
summary analysis of evaluations from this week ' s workshops :
our overall belief is that the workshops , the one on one attention , the new
content etc . are being received very well ( scores averages around 3 . 5 on a
scale of 1 - 4 )
the score for the question of whether sap will meet the reporting needs is
still too low ( average of 2 . 8 ) . we will continue to analyze the root cause
of this problem .
there is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules
contain which data . we believe that a hand - out we developed really helped
this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning .
comments received :
very good and useful
could have used this sooner
sessions are not long enough
i love the workshop idea , its so much better than training classes
feel free to contact me , melissa or kim with any questions or concerns .

dear sir or madam :
enron corp . ( "" enron "" ) believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards . as outlined in enron ' s code of ethics , employees of enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with enron ' s business ethics policy which requires an employee to conduct himself / herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his / her employment with enron . further , enron ' s business ethics policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by enron employees for special position , price , or privilege .
not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy , but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical . enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with enron . enron ' s auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom enron does business . your recognition of our ethical standards allows enron employees to work with you via arm ' s length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations . if you ever become aware of variances from our policy , please advise :
>
your business relationship is important to us , and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you .
very truly yours ,"

0,"ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 26 , 2001
enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
"" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

0,i am certainly for this idea i feel that taking speakup out of the kernel and putting it in userspace would be stripping it of its most valuable feature speaking from bootup to shutdown if the code can be updated and fixed properly then it should be included in the mainline kernel does anyone know what linus's opinion of this is original message from igor gueths to sent wednesday june escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm subject speakup in mainline was gentoo dropping speakup begin pgp signed message hash shaescapenumber hi all i have been observing this thread for quite some time and one question keeps jumping out at me every time i see another message regarding moving speakup into userspace why is it that instead of discussing ways to get speakup into mainline we are contemplating rewriting speakup as a userspace hybrid program thereby introducing entirely new bugs problems imo the only thing we are doing by contemplating this possible rewrite is shifting the focus away from the underlying problem that afaik has been with us since the linux escapenumber escapenumber days as has probably been outlined here various times in the past having speakup in the mainline kernel tree has several advantages first breakage building problems would be pretty nonexistent since the rest of the kernel community would at least have to acknowledge the existence of speakup in the tree also kirk's job of constantly rewriting new code fixing existing code as a result of some change in a later kernel version would probably become significantly easier since the console etc code that speakup relies on for its underlying operation would have to be written and or modified with speakup in mind not the other way around what i am trying to say by all this is that the advantages to having speakup in the mainline kernel tree are numerous however the problem is and has been getting to that point afaik there is still progress attempting to be made on this front such as a git repository being made for speakup and the driver patches however as i understand it speakup's code needs quite a bit of cleaning up befor it can be considered for inclusion into mainline unfortunately i am not nearly familiar enough with the kernel code to be able to aid in this task however i believe that if we all work together to achieve this goal that it in fact can be done with regard to gentoo dropping speakup as of later releases while it is a setback as far as getting speakup into as many distros as possible goes i don't see why it can't be re included in gentoo at some later date once build and possibly other issues are resolved with speakup patched into linux escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber in summary imo userspace speakup is not the only answer nor is it the correct one speakup should remain in the kernel so as to provide the best screen reading experience possible however in order to achieve this end we first need to get speakup into mainline this may take quite a bit of time and hacking however in time i think it can be done feel free to add any comments as necessary i am curious as to what everyone has to say on this igor begin pgp signature version gnupg vescapenumber escapenumber escapenumber gnu linux escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong jescapenumber cgc escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong g escapelong xfez ujx escapelong zcuq escapelong a escapelong escapelong xdk escapelong cnuk qltwwdhzlwge escapelong escapelong hhvu end pgp signature this message has been scanned for viruses and dangerous content by mailscanner and is believed to be clean speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup nodescapenumber escapenumber escapenumber information this message was checked by nodescapenumber antivirus system http www eset com speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

summer interns and associates that ebs research will be hiring . i am talking
about compensation here . ken rice mentioned that ebs is in the process of
developing a technical equivalent of our aa pool . ebs research people can
potentially rotate through this pool in the future . i just don ' t want to
risk losing people like giuseppe ( & get the word out that we are low - ballers )

we talked to rabi . he ' s sitting on the fence for some good reasons , and he
has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a
lower level but has more potential . wrt the green , vince verbally offered
salary of $ 105 k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a
minimum of $ 15 k cash . that ' s in addition to the $ 15 k sign on bonus . vince
said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and
until rabi came back with a verbal ok . he will ponder the offer ; probably
for a few more days and get back with us . he may well call you to discuss
the exact details of the benefits . esop , 401 ( k ) contributions , etc .

0,"the commission held its first open meeting with pat wood as the new chairman today and discussed many interesting issues . the following is a summary of the meeting . the meeting is still going on , and we will provide an addendum to this email updating you on what was discussed this afternoon ( regarding market power ) .
rtos
chairman wood expressed his desire to finish the rto transition , and that the commission needs to provide guidance and leadership in order to speed up the rto transition . chairman wood considers the rto effort on two tracks : 1 ) organizational - - what will the rto organizations look like , and 2 ) substantive - - once you set up the organizations , what will they do .
organizational effort : wood stated that this effort has already begun with the july 12 orders and the northeast and southeast mediation efforts . the commission will be issuing additional orders in the northeast , southeast and midwest within the next couple of ferc meetings . wood also stated that it is time for rto west and desert star to "" marry up , "" meaning , i suppose , that the two should consolidate . wood does not think that california can be included in the western rto yet since it has lingering problems .
structural effort : the commission will initiate a section 206 proceeding to address market design and structure issues in order to translate the 8 functions established in order no . 2000 into rto structures . to achieve this goal , the commission is establishing an "" rto week "" of advanced workshops , from october 15 - 19 , in advance of issuing a nopr , to address structural issues such as : congestion management ; cost recovery ; market monitoring ; transmission planning ; reliability ; transmission rights . wood also envisions that the commission will develop a new pro forma tariff to replace the existing order no . 888 transmission tariff . the new tariff will apply to all public utilities and rtos .
wood also recognized that some "" sticks "" are needed to entice rto participation . therefore , wood proposes to have all public utilities come in by december 15 , 2001 with a declaration to join an rto . if they do not make this declaration , these entities will have their market based rate authority revoked on a prospective basis . furthermore , wood states that if entities do not join rtos , they should not be authorized to merge their facilities , and that ferc will also look at their rates to determine whether they are still just and reasonable rates compared with rates offered by rtos . wood states that these "" sticks "" provide incentive , but do not mandate , rto participation .
with regard to the pending requests for rehearing , wood asked legal staff to figure out how "" ferc can get there . "" in other words , i think wood is telling them to develop the legal analysis for denying rehearing .
while commissioner breathitt is skeptical about some of these rto proposals , because she was not required to vote on anything today , she only expressed her concern .
upcoming dates
october 15 - 19 - - rto workshops
end of october - - further orders on northeast , southeast , midwest rtos
december 15 , 2001 - - all public utilities must commit to an rto or have their market based rates revoked
proposed rule for standards of conduct
within the next few days , ferc will be issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking ( "" nopr "" ) on standards of conduct for transmission providers . as explained at the meeting ( we do not have a copy of the nopr yet ) , the nopr will propose to apply standards of conduct uniformly to electric transmission providers and gas pipeline transportation providers similarly . the nopr also proposes to broaden the definition of affiliate to include all energy affiliates , not just marketers . the standards of conduct would not apply to rtos and transmission providers who are members of an rto may ask for an exemption from the standards .
the nopr will also likely include a proposal that the standards apply to transmission - owners ' marketing affiliates that are serving native load customers . as you know , the present standards do not apply to the affiliates of tos that are only buying and selling power for native load customers . as the interim general counsel noted , these marketing affiliates can go into the control room and have unrestricted interaction with the to .
there was some discussion of whether it is necessary to apply the standards to affiliates serving native load . staff told the commissioners that market participants have been complaining for years about this loop hole in the rules . pat wood said they will include the proposal in the nopr ( breathitt may not support ) , but if the industry does not support the proposal , ferc will pull it . we of course will strongly support the proposal .
provision of adequate electrical capacity ( icap )
chairman wood asked staff to prepare a presentation on reserves and installed capacity requirements . wood noted that the commission had to issue an order on icap in new england during their recess in august , and he is not that familiar with the issues . therefore , he asked staff to prepare a presentation , which they made at the meeting this morning . the presentation will be made public within the next couple of days . in sum , staff seems to believe that some type of icap requirement is needed for reliability .
after the presentation , wood noted that the new england icap order has enough wiggle room to allow the commission to change its mind once the commissioners better understand the issue . wood sees that there is a potential conflict between decentralized , competitive markets and the need for sufficient supply ( without politically unacceptable , prolonged price spikes ) .
commissioner brownell ( from the pennsylvania puc ) has a better understanding of icap and expressed concerns that icap may be an outdated tool that acts as a barrier to entry without any definable benefit to customers .
realizing that there are many positions on this topic , chairman wood said he will publish the staff report and ask for comments by october 17 . we will definitely submit comments on this and will include everyone in the drafting process .
sorry this is so long , but a lot happened today . we will provide a summary of the market power discussion as soon as it is over . let us know if you have any questions .

i ' ve just had a chat with richard , who feels strongly that the natural
synergies between , and independence of , research and structuring will be best
served if i report to tani .
i expressed my concerns that i want to keep a strong link with :
1 . accountability to the trader sense of urgency , and
2 . traders ' willingness to spend money where necessary .
richard suggested that we have a strong "" dotted line "" of reporting in to him ,
and that he will be available to support these areas . we ' ll meet regularly
to keep richard in the loop .
i filled richard in on the fact that i wish to change the nature , not just
the size , of the research group , which will involve significant changes in
headcount and investment in hardware / software .
i ' ve no doubt that my main concerns of accountability and budget support will
be met whether i report to richard formally or informally .
tani has indicated that she ' d be prepared to have research report to her if
required .
all the best ,

0,"dear everyone ,
we understand the as members of enron research group , all of us are working
on very interesting projects , some of which are ground - breaking , and we all
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology . we also find
out , through our own experience , that at this age of information explosion ,
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department , let
alone in the industry . it is also our personal experience that many a
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of
this group .
as a remedy , we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag
lunch group meeting , once every two weeks on friday , for about 50 minutes .
it is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new
technology and development , as well as with each other  , s work , so that we do
not have to reinvent the wheels .
we envision the following : in this meeting ( or seminar ) , each one of us will
take turns to make presentations to the group . the topics could range from
theoretical consideration to practical implementation , be it option pricing ,
process modelling , insurance issue , or monte carlo simulation , or anything
one finds fascinating . the presentation material could be papers you have
been reading recently , projects you are working on , some problem that
bothers you , or an idea that is fascinating . you choose your own
presentation style . it could be
everything - you - always - wanted - to - know - but - were - afraid - to - ask , hand waving
style , or it can involve nitty - gritty , detailed derivations , anyway a style
that suits you and the topic . or it can simply be a dry - run for your
presentation at the next risk conference . zimin and alex will take upon the
responsibility of organizing the seminar .
we hope the seminar will be up and running in two - three weeks . for that
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated . please let either zimin or
alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and
provide a tentative schedule . surely the rest of the group will be happy to
hear your presentation .
we encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting , either to give a
talk or just sit in .

this morning , the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by
infinity from the erms system . we normally get 375 books and only got 296
this morning .
per conversation with joyce kuo and mike moscoso , susan trevino , risk
controls , and christian , rac , changed the book heirarchy on friday , moving
global products books , including the prepays , out of the ect group and into
another group . we have had discussions in the past verifying with risk
controls that the ect group is the only group which automatically sends its
cash flows to infinity . other cash flows from books are included only by
being listed in a script . this was not done when the books were moved from
the ect group on friday .
obviously , the rate & currency is not able to hedge enron ' s cash flows when
so much has been omitted . at this time we are about one hour away from a
good hedging report for the trading desk . this report is due the desk daily
by 7 : 30 am .
mike and i discussed the need for controls and sign - off by him or shona for
changes in book heirarchy .

the demand fee is probably the best solution . we can use it to create a
recieivable / payable with tenaska , depending on which way the calculation goes
each month . how are pma ' s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
deal put in the system ?
attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
today . some of this info will change by the end of the month . as you can
see , there are some discrepancies between megan ' s calculations and what is on
the general ledger . ua 4 is also on my schedule . unless the buys / sells are
volumetrically balanced , we book an entry to balance the desk . this will
change the calculation of what is due from / to tenaska . should we be
recording a ua 4 entry for cleburne ? is it addressed in the agreement with
tenaska ?

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related

majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .

subject : merchanting metals update # 2
the intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update (
see attached email ) was to provide
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage , spread and brand
and location
a timely substantiation of
stock on balance sheet
forward mtm
debtors and creditor balances
obsf transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany
account
despite the best efforts of it , continuing problems with the as 400
application , a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock
reconciliation reports , and concerns over the useability of the outright
stock screen enquiry are such that i am currently not confident of delivering
sufficient accurate information to aa to satisfy their audit requirements -
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and
forward positions to full accounting values .
consequently i need to inform you of , and / or require your approval for , the
following :
i will discuss with aa the following
that obsf values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with aa on model
simplifications )
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses ,
as 400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to aa
within the audit timetable )
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see mo work )
the creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards
) for key metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to
meet the above stated objectives
the signoff for additional permanent ' enron ' headcount who will ' duplicate '
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing
traffic staff
a reconciling difference of $ 15 mm exists between the reported dpr and the
final accounting p & l as generated on the as 400 . we will continue to
investigate potential misstatements in the system p & l , as a result of data or
system valuation problems , within the month end reporting timeframe . however ,
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and
signoff of system p & l values with traders .
the recall of all obsf stock in early april and retention on balance sheet (
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated .
middle office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic / co - ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ) , requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all obsf contracts that must be reconciled to
barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of obsf option premium utilising the above manually
created position analysis
the circularisation of barclays intercompany account and comparison to our
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors / creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business
23 rd
i will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

subject : merchanting metals update
several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating
risk for the merchanting metals business .
complexities surrounding the operation of the off balance sheet facility
( "" obsf "" ) which commenced two weeks before the year end .
the uncertainty generated by the revocation of aa ' s signoff for the facility
late in the year end audit .
the discovery of a number of ' bugs ' within the as 400 merchanting code ,
arising from the release of obsf designed functionality , which compounded the
operational burden of supporting the obsf .
the requirement to amend the operational process and obsf it code as a result
of the current renegotiation of the obsf with barclays ( and aa ) .
the senior it developer for merchanting has resigned and been sent on
gardening leave .
the corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the merchanting
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues .
various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus , gain
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as
to the accuracy of the ql dpr and business balance sheet .
the implementation for sap for the merchanting business has been delayed and
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) brokerage
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on obsf for it merchanting
developers .
the ar / ap sap data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as
to provide a detailed analysis as at end ql .
middle office have instigated a new daily working capital report process
tracking cash settlement / funding data to working capital components for all
metals businesses .
an enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end ql
covering gross tonnage , spread positions and summarised analyses for brand
and locations . the necessary report functionality should be available within
the as 400 , however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical
vba / excel reports outside of the as 400 but using as 400 data downloads .
user requests for additional as 400 functionality and reports have been
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of
ql following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements
for the support of obsf .
a resubstantiation of the full ql dpr will be completed by the risk control
staff reconciling the full trial balances between ql open and ql close
a full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the ql audit
timetable which incorporates
a full circularisation of inventory balances , and matching to source
documentation within enron
inspection of certain of the above inventory balances , by third party
inspectors , where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will
not be received on a timely basis
substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report
signed off by the traders )
full reconciliation and recalculation of obsf option premium values
full reconciliation of contracts within the obsf to barclays documentation (
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase )
and to as 400 barclays account
a risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation , where
applicable , and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
a full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or
external documentation ( invoices / request for payment )
a full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
a full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts
i intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during
april

escapenumber images http www afrikanet info index php option com content task view id escapenumber item id escapenumber the kingdom of benin had a long history of peaceful relations with european nations many early portuguese dutch and british visitors had expressed admiration for this great african civilization however just under escapenumber years ago in escapenumber the british fueled by a desire to control trade in the area launched a punitive expedition to attack benin city they deposed of the oba king of benin burnt down his palace and looted the collection of unique art works in bronze and ivory that adorned the palace the premier collection of the priceless benin art treasures is today held at the museum of mankind in london the events of escapenumber justification for the violent overthrow of this independent kingdom was to avenge the deaths of seven britons who had been ambushed who had been ambushed on a path to benin a few weeks earlier they were represented as peaceful ambassadors sent to discuss the operation of a trade treaty with the oba who were then murdered in cold blood however the evidence tells a different story before they set out james philips the colonial officer who headed the mission sent a report to his superiors in whitehall complaining about the unprofitability of trade in the area he recommended i am certain that there is only one remedy that is to depose of the king of benin i am concerned that pacific measures are now quite useless and that the time has now come to remove the obstruction i would add that i have reason to hope that sufficient ivory may be found in the king's house to pay the expenses incurred philips sent a message to the oba informing him of his intention to visit benin and received a reply asking him to delay his visit for a while due to the customary rites that were being performed at the time during which foreigners were not permitted to enter the city philips ignored several such messages it is not surprising that the generals whose task it was to defend benin saw this expedition that had refused to heed repeated request to turn back and wait for an official invitation as a threat in the recent past the british had used force several times to depose other african leaders whom they had found too powerful to dominate they responded to this threat by ambushing the party leaving seven of the nine britons dead the british government and press responded with self righteous outrage the benis saw the escapenumber event as an evil intrusion to their sovereignty end the annexation of their region by a foreign power as unjustified the then king oba ovonramwen was subsequently deposed and sent into exile benin city whose civilization dates further back than the escapenumberth century was almost completely destroyed sacred treasures discovered by the colonial army were stripped from their rightful owners and looted mainly to britain and later to other countries in the west the benin bronzes today when the looted art treasures were brought back to england many of the military officers kept private collections of them whilst the foreign office sold considerable quantities much of which found it's way to museums of europe and america the remarkable quality of the work was rapidly reflected in high auction room prices the foreign office gave the british museum a huge quantity of bronze wall plaques which depict the history of the benin empire in the escapenumber escapenumberth and escapenumber escapenumberth century many are displayed in the ethnographic section of the museum the premier collection of these priceless benin art treasures are today held at the museum of mankind there are also many many more held in private collections which we do not know about these museums also retained selling rights of duplicates to the originals which of course means that enormous profits have been made in escapenumber sothebys auctioned a benin plaque featuring a musician in the catalogue accompanying the auction the asking price was set at between escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber many famous european artists such as picasso have emulated the fine and abstract dimensional images found in benin art however not a penny from this profit has ever gone back to benin from where the art was stolen african scholars must by necessity travel to london to see these works displayed without adequate commentary or proper context the british museum and london continues to gain income from visitors from africa and elsewhere this should of course be transferred to africa africa is the appropriate place to study and understand african art and artefacts and it would also generate much needed income from tourism and scholarship if these items were returned the nigerian government has made several unsuccessful requests for the restitution of these artefacts since escapenumber when they gained independence on several occasions they paid exorbitant prices amounting to thousands of pounds to retain possession of some of these artefacts great offence was caused when the british museum and the british government refused even the loan of a single ivory mask for a vast pan african arts festival in escapenumber the looting of artworks in the course of military conflict has been outlawed since the napoleonic wars and the restitution of looted works within europe enforced increasingly the morality and legality of holding art collections seized by force is being questioned in the true sense of justice and self determination the benin artefacts belong to the culture from where they were deprived from they symbolise a historical and social significance which the aesthetic and monetary value they hold in exile would never compensate http www

by getty museum athens prime minister costas karamanlis on thursday praised the culture ministry's systematic work for the return of the parthenon marbles to greece as well as the return of all antiquities illegally excavated and smuggled out of the country in the effort to safeguard greece's cultural heritage defending our cultural heritage using all legal means is a self evident obligation claiming from foreign museums and collectors every greek ancient artifact for which we have evidence that it was the product of antiquities smuggling illegal excavation or illegal trade is a matter of urgent priority the greek premier stressed karamanlis was speaking to reporters after a handover ceremony marking the return of two important ancient greek artifacts from the j paul getty museum in los angeles held at the national archaeological museum in athens where the artifacts will be on display the artifacts are a escapenumberth century b c gold funerary wreath from the northern greek province of macedonia and an archaic era statue of a 'kore' young woman made of parian marble they are the last of four artifacts returned to greece by the museum under an agreement announced a few months ago the agreement with the getty museum where the antiquities were housed was reached after the greek government contested the legality of their export from the country karamanlis further said that a bill aimed at curbing the illegal trade and smuggling of antiquties would be tabled in parliament by the culture ministry in the near future policy is vindicated when it yields tangible results our goals become action day by day karamanlis added the greek premier also referred to the completion of the new acropolis museum and the return of two fragments of the parthenon and the erechtheum in escapenumber noting that these dismissed the spurious excuses put forward for not returning the parthenon sculptures speaking after the premier culture minister george voulgarakis described the two ancient artifacts retrieved from the j paul getty museum as masterpieces of greek art the minister also emphasised the fact that all four items returned by the getty were given back without any form of exchange and without intervention by a court the era when stolen objects of great value could be bought on the 'grey' market is gone never to return voulgarakis underlined he noted that the deal would allow greece to claim the things that rightfully belonged to it provided there was proof that it had been illegally obtained and exported from the country according to the minister meanwhile the international community's shift to respecting international law and ethics was not incompatible with the healthy interests of great museums apart from the golden wreath and the kore the los angeles based getty museum had in august escapenumber returned a escapenumberth century b c black limestone stele grave marker and a escapenumberth century b c marble votive relief from thasos that also went on display at the national archaeological museum in athens the stele was unearthed during an illegal dig in the escapenumbers near the city of thebes while the votive relief was stolen almost a

acrimonious international debate about black market trafficking in antiquities that may encourage the plundering of archaeological sites the ima isn't the only museum struggling with this issue the j

year new york's metropolitan museum of art agreed to return objects allegedly stolen from ancient sites in italy in exchange for long term loans of other objects its director philippe de montebello

saying museum directors could no longer stand behind old collecting practices the ground is shifting radically under the pressure of newly documented claims he said while there may not be a single clear solution for every claim institutions will need to be forthright in explaining future acquisitions anderson thinks the ima policy which still lets it acquire antiquities if they arrived in the u

take a similar step along with collectors and dealers anderson wrote in this month's edition of the art newspaper published in london a universal moratorium would seriously impact the clandestine trade in antiquities one ima patron agreed that museums must be concerned about an object's pedigree objects ought to be documented regardless of the year said northwestside resident robert grubbs

of
the new competitive era , thanks to the interest and participation of the
stakeholders for over two years . "" stated pete landrieu , maac executive board
chair .
phillip g . harris , regional manager of maac , commented "" the relationship
between
reliability and markets will be enhanced and strengthened by the maac
restructuring . we are also pleased to be making this change as effectively as
possible through the use of existing pjm organizational and other resources . ""
under the filed agreement , a new maac members committee is chartered with the
creation of the approval process of the maac reliability principles and
standards . other new maac committees are chartered , most notably , a maac
energy
market committee to serve as a forum for the discussion of the impact of
reliability on the commercial market place , and the marketplace on
reliability .
the agreement also provides for stakeholder representation on the maac board .
appropriate amendments to existing pjm agreements will be discussed with the
pjm
members and filed with the ferc .
the mid - atlantic area council was established in december 1967 to augment the
reliability of the bulk electric supply systems of its members through
coordinated planning of generation and transmission facilities . the maac
region
encompasses nearly 50 , 000 square miles from virginia to new york and from the
atlantic ocean to the great lakes . under the existing maac agreement and the

vince : i left you a voicemail about charles shen a week or so ago , but
wanted to follow up with you . when i called him to extend our offer to him ,
he expressed surprise at the base salary offer of $ 110 , 000 , and told me that
he was currently earning base pay in the amount of $ 120 , 000 . i told him
that the salary figure he had written himself on the application was
$ 102 , 000 , but he insisted that he had made an error and that it should have
been $ 120 , 000 . i asked him what base salary he was looking for , and he said
he would expect at least a 10 % increase in his base . i then told him that i
was not authorized to make an offer above our initial one , and would contact
you and get back to him .
i called him later that afternoon and asked him to fax me a copy of his last
paycheck stub so that we could minimize the confusion about his base pay . he
said that he would be happy to do so , but i never received the fax . he left
me a voicemail message during the evening that said he was on vacation and
didn ' t have access to the pay stubs , but would send me a copy when he
returned .
i have not heard from him since , and wondered if he had contacted you . if
not , would you want to get together to discuss our next step ?

0,"thanks for the slides . there really is nothing new under the sun . the key
is to identify the source of competitive advantage . to my mind it ' s the same
line of thought that leads us to see eol as sustainable , but neutral b 2 b
marketplaces as temporary . our only competitive advantage is that we are the
largest principal member of the potential club , making our participation most
critical . given this , our timing and positioning relative to potentially
joining others may be the single most important strategic decision we make .
i would enjoy hearing your thoughts on any other elements of competitve
advantage that we could leverage , particularly those elements that are most

0,on sat escapenumber apr escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber arnoud engelfriet wrote francesco poli wrote we are trying to write a good trademark license i would not complicate things further by trying to write a trademark and copyright license i would rather avoid mixing those two areas of law escapenumber i'm not sure that is possible when we're talking about the logo it is protected both by copyright and by trademark i can't copy and distribute the logo unless i am licensed under both what i am proposing is just licensing under both laws but with two separate grants of permissions a copyright license expat and a trademark license the one we are trying to write as long as i need both of them to do what i want to that is to say as long as what i want to do infringes both copyright and trademark rights i have to comply with both sets of conditions as soon as i need only one of them i can ignore the conditions written in the other one that's why i think that having the same no confusion condition in both licenses is useless and potentially harmful correct me if i'm wrong escapenumber you could of course separately license the two but then you run in exactly the problem i tried to solve with the conditional escapenumber copyright grant which problem i don't understand why i cannot separately license copyrights and trademarks as an example i write an essay that includes the words microsoft windows debian and linux assume this essay is my original work of authorship i am therefore its copyright holder i license its copyright under the terms of the gnu gpl vescapenumber nonetheless those four words which are not copyrightable are trademarks of their respective owners and i cannot use them in ways that break trademark laws unless i have a trademark license that allows me to do otherwise this is true independently of the copyright license i chose for the essay i don't need to insert trademark restrictions into the copyright license as they hold anyway i don't see any problem or contradiction in this escapenumber what concerns me most is making the copyright grant of permission conditional on the no confusion condition escapenumber i did that to ensure that people couldn't take the logo change a few pixels and then use the derivative logo in a confusing way they would need a copyright license to create a derivative work and they have one but they also would need a trademark license to use a confusingly similar logo to refer to something other than debian and they do not have one because the trademark license we are writing does not allow this kind of use hence i cannot see why the trademark restriction should in your opinion be restated in the copyright license if the copyright license doesn't tie in to the trademark license but instead says do whatever you want with your derivative people could argue the copyright license trumps the trademark restriction in my above described example does my gpl licensing of the essay allow people to argue that they can change the text in such a way that it uses the term microsoft to refer to sun microsystems inc as far as copyright is concerned they need my permission and they indeed have it as far as trademark is concerned they need a permission from microsoft corporation and they do not have one escapenumber i still fail to see how a copyright license could trump a trademark restriction escapenumber unless they are bill gates or a few others escapenumber suppose i derive a new image from the debian swirl logo and assume that my derivative work is sufficiently different that it's not confusingly similar to the original logo it is my understanding that i would not need any trademark license to use my heavily modified image not even for commercial use is this correct i would instead need a copyright license to create and distribute my derivative work escapenumber if the derivative image isn't confusingly similar to the trademark logo then the no confusion condition does not apply that's why i say it should not stay attached to the heavily modified image it should be dropped as soon as the trademark license is no longer needed that suggests me to place the no confusion condition inside the trademark license but not inside the copyright license escapenumber you are not allowed to use any sign in commerce that creates confusion with someone's trademark logo it doesn't matter if your sign is a derivative work of the logo under copyright law i could be completely ignorant of your mark fiddle a bit with the gimp and produce a swirl that accidentally looks like the debian logo copyright says i'm fine but i still can't put that swirl on cd roms with an operating system and sell those what you are saying here makes perfectly sense to me but seems to confirm that there's no need to insert the no confusing condition into the copyright license escapenumber so i can't imagine a situation where the trademark restriction affecting the copyright license would be a problem i can't imagine a situation where it would be useful it could be awkward and misleading for instance suppose you download an image representing a fish which happens to be a derivative work of the debian swirl after many many heavy modifications that image is not confusingly similar to the debian logo hence the only needed license is the copyright one you would receive the fish image with a copyright license and no trademark license suppose the copyright license stated that you cannot use the fish image in commerce in such a way to cause confusion as to the affiliation and so forth with the debian project and spi wouldn't it be awkward i mean it's true but the same holds for any other entity you cannot use the fish image in commerce to cause confusion as to the affiliation and so forth with microsoft corporation either but there's no need to state that inside the copyright license escapenumber trademark laws say so please note that with the fish image there's more or less the same likelihood of causing confusion with the debian project and with microsoft corporation actually close to zero escapenumber in summary i think that enforcing trademark like restrictions through copyright would be possibly harmful escapenumber this isn't a trademark like restriction it is an actual trademark restriction you're right that means that enforcing it through copyright is less harmful possibly harmless but useless as well an alternative would be to drop the exception on the copyright license and modify the trademark license to say escapenumber the mark holder hereby licenses you to use the marks or a modified version thereof in any way you are not authorized to use the marks or a modified version thereof escapenumber that makes it clear you are not licensed under the trademark to use derivatives in a confusing way it's not as clear as what i previously suggested because now you have to figure out which wins the copyright license that says you can do anything or the trademark license that says you cannot do this one thing as i said above i think that none of them wins one grants permissions as far as copyrights are concerned the other grants permissions as far as trademarks are concerned when you need both licenses because you infringe both trademark and copyright rights you have to comply with both licenses when you only need one you can ignore the other or am i completely off track escapenumber http frx netsons org doc nanodocs etch workstation install html need to read a debian etch

john , hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth

i ' m in ny now and won ' t return until thursday morning . perhaps it would be
easiest for john to come to the video conference on thursday ( if he ' s in
houston ) or via telephone if he ' s travelling ? ?
whatever you both think is best . . please let me know !
my assistant , melinda mccarty , is setting up the call location at the enron

christie ,
as we talked last thursday via video teleconference , we are planning to
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing / promotion plan for newpower
including value - added products and services for the future . before we talk
again on thursday , we would like to speak with john henderson again to see if
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address .
we are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a
phone meeting between us , or if it would be best to include him in our next
video teleconference . we are available the next two days at lpm and 4 pm
houston time .
we understand that john is a very busy person , and we appreciate any help you
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his
expectations .
thanks ,

dissertation work . he stated that he understood and other companies had
expressed similar concerns .

re : arrangements to accommodate ferc ' s june 19 , 2001 order
dear _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ :
the montana power company ( "" mpc "" ) and enron power marketing , inc . ( "" epmi "" ) are parties to a confirmation letter dated december 20 , 1999 ( the term of which has been extended by letter dated _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ) under which epmi has been purchasing energy for resale to mpc or selling energy received from mpc into the wholesale market . as you are no doubt aware , the ferc issued an order on june 19 , 2001 that imposes new restrictions upon wholesale energy sales throughout the wscc .
one restriction that affects our agreement is that marketers , such as epmi , may not sell energy at prices above the price cap set by the california iso ( "" california cap "" ) . generators are permitted to sell above the price cap if they can justify their prices . as a result , at times ( such as during this week ' s heat wave which caused blackouts in las vegas ) epmi may not be able to purchase energy anywhere in the west at a price below the california cap . because epmi cannot pass through costs of purchasing energy above the california cap to mpc , we cannot purchase such energy on mpc ' s behalf for resale to mpc .
however , in order to continue to serve mpc ' s needs at times of peak demand , scarce supply , and high prices , epmi proposes the following solution :
1 . if epmi is unable to acquire energy at a price at or below the california cap , epmi will strive to meet mpc ' s energy needs by arranging for a generator to deliver energy to mpc and for mpc to pay the generator directly .
2 . epmi will notify the seller that it is purchasing the energy on behalf of a customer , who will be paying the generator directly for that energy .
3 . epmi will notify mpc of the identity of the seller , along with the amount to be paid the seller , and provide other information and assistance to enable mpc to pay the seller directly .
4 . all other aspects of the existing agreement will remain unchanged .
we believe this proposal allows epmi to continue to meet mpc ' s needs , while complying with federal law . if you have another proposal , or would like to discuss this matter further , please feel free to call either christian yoder at ( 503 ) 464 - 7845 or steve hall at ( 503 ) 464 - 7795 .
otherwise , kindly acknowledge your understanding and agreement to this amendment by signing in the place provided below .

0,hi nataniel a quick and easy way to do this is to run a decision tree analysis like chaid or discriminant analysis using the cluster variables you used as the predictors and the cluster membership as the outcome variable the decision tree will highlight in a monotonic sense which variables in respective order drive the clusters into groups the algorithm is upside down in a sense but it does help to identify what is driving your clusters apart this might help to identify the bigger differences in some of the groups remember when comparing cluster groups you need to look at differences between the groups and also the standard deviation dispersion around clusters hth paul original message from monica pisica to sent wednesday april escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm subject r kmeans cluster analysis hi nataniel as far as i know there is a package called clusttool which has a very nice interface with the capability to do different cluster analyses it also prodused a plot of each cluster and the mean for each cluster of each variable and i guess this is what you are after but depending of which parameters you are using for the cluster analysis the package is extremely slow if you have more than escapenumber datapoints maybe you can take the function apart to see where and what generates the plot and use that for your analysis i hope this helps monica palaseanu lovejoy message escapenumber date tue escapenumber apr escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber gmt from nathaniel grey subject r kmeans cluster analysis to r help stat math ethz ch message id escapenumber escapenumber qm webescapenumber mail ird yahoo com content type text plain hello i have a data set containing escapenumber variables after appropriate transformations etc i ran a kmeans cluster analysis for escapenumber clusters i ran it escapenumber times to find a result with the lowest within sum of squares my question is how best do i go about finding out what the characteristics are of each cluster is one cluster dominated by a particular set of variables or by a particular variable the only way i know is to to look at the means for each variable for each cluster but as there are escapenumber variables this is time consuming is there a way to graphically represent the clusters in relation to the variables if so i might need some guidance on the coding as i am new to the r environment any advice and direction would be gratefully received best wishes nataniel grey live http clk atdmt com mrt go escapelong direct escapenumber r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code

0,"there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify
system .
1 . cage ranch - since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this
gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and
king ranch is re - delivering to stratton . it is also my understanding that
there is a . 05 cent fee
to deliver this gas . we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl
at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas
will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is
not being nominated from a processing agreement . we either , need to input
a point nom ( on hpl or krgp ) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 ,
or a deal for purchase and sale ( if king ranch is taking title to the gas )
needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate . i
have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow , so we can
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made .
2 . forest oil - there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow
from the meter ( 6396 ) into king ranch . it is my
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had
their own processing agreement . i need confirmation that the gas from this
meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement
should have been reassigned to hplc . ( it is currently still under hplr ) .
if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once
again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a
point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 ."

the forgery came to light when another sculpture from syria was sent by a private client for examination at the british museum this time experts failed to be taken in and on further investigation discovered that it must have come from the same dubious source as the amarna princess scotland yard's arts and antiques squad seized the syrian relief along with two other pieces from london and impounded the princess but by then the sculpture much feted despite its lack of head arms or lower legs had been proudly displayed across britain the vendor had claimed that his great grandfather had bought it at the auction of the property of the earl of egremont in escapenumber bolton council officials who uncovered a copy of the sale catalogue were unable to find any mention of the princess in

disappointed by how the two families are handling the heritage of their ancestors he told the art newspaper there is no respect for the oeuvre it s all about the money they can make renoir guino bronzes were made at the end of renoir s life when the artist used an assistant richard guino as his hands with auguste renoir guino won joint copyright to these pieces which has passed to guino s heirs they have produced and sold the bronzes for many years as well as issuing certificates of authenticity mr javogue was associated with the guinos for some years as their us representative and sold some pieces he now says that the guinos have produced sculptures with the same edition numbers claims that the family deny his change of opinion comes during a long running series of lawsuits between the guinos and emmanuel renoir who is claiming the right to reproduce renoir guino pieces in the us the guinos accuse mr renoir and his partners of making unauthorised repro ductions of the sculptures from original plasters to sell in the us a charge mr renoir denies because he says the works are in the public domain in the us and so cannot be copyrighted in a sworn statement seen by the

unauthorised pieces christie s said in a statement we are monitoring the matter as with all properties sold at christie s this bronze was researched prior to sale by specialists and we also worked

0,dear r users i'm a little stuck with the following problem s hopefully somebody can offer some help i have data organized in a binary matrix which can become quite big like escapenumber rows x escapenumber escapenumber columns they represent snp genotypes for some background info what i need to do is the following let's suppose i have a matrix of size n x m for each of the m columns i want to know the counts of unique rows extended one by one from the core column for both values at the core separately and in both directions maybe better explained with a little example data escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber so the extended unique rows counts taking e g column escapenumber as core are col escapenumber escapenumber right patterns counts escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber left escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber and that for the other subset colescapenumber escapenumber as well then doing the whole thing again for the next core column the reason i need this counts is that i want to calculate frequencies of the different extended sequences to calculate the probability of drawing two identical sequences from the core up to an extended position from the whole set of sequences my main problem is speed of the calculations i tried different ways suggested here in the list of getting the counts of the unique rows all of them using the table function both a combination of table do call paste c as data frame mymatrix or table apply mymatrix escapenumber paste collapse work fine but are too slow for bigger matrices that i want to calculate at least in my not very sophisticated function then i found a great suggestion here to do a matrix multiplication with a vector of escapenumber escapenumber ncol escapenumber to convert each row into a decimal number and do table on those this speeds up things quite nicely although the problem is that it of course does not work as soon as i extended for more than escapenumber columns because the decimal numbers get to large to accurately distinguish between a escapenumber and escapenumber at the smallest digit escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber true another thing is that so far i could not come up with an idea on how or if it is possible to do this without the loops i am using one large loop for each column in turn as core and then another loop within that extends the rows by growing column numbers since i am not the best of programmers and still quite new to r i was hoping that somebody has some advice on doing this calculations in a more elegant and more importantly fast way just to get the idea the approach with the matrix multiplication takes escapenumbers for a escapenumber x escapenumber matrix on my macbook pro which is obviously not perfect considering i would like to use this function for matrices of size escapenumber escapenumber x escapenumber escapenumber or even more so i would be very thankful for any ideas suggestions etc to improve this cheers martin r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code

listed items are those that are open that we need information from
you on . i will send a separate email that will address ecm , pge and affiliate
information . corp . is looking to type the first draft of the annual report
( to be discussed with the audit committee ) this friday , so we need your help
with this information as soon as possible . if you will not be able to have
all of the information to eugenio by thursday night , please let me know . we
may be able to give you some additional time to gather some of the smaller
pieces . if you need to forward this on to others , please do so .
aa if you know of any other issues of completeness that i have not addressed ,
please let eugenio and i know !
* why is agg _ ect and agg _ index not available for january 1999 ?
* is cuiba in esa ' s nos . is it gas or power ? what month was it first
included ? is that the trade month ?
* when did australia first have substantial activity ? for some reason , the
spreadsheet has a june number , no july or august , then september -
december . if the first half of the year has material activity , we need to
get it from them .
* has the merrill peaker transaction been calculated yet ( it was not
originally in thedpr ) ? we definitely have to have that for the dec . number .
* where is ees gas ? is it in the agg _ ect ?
* when did kinneman ' s debt activity start ? the first var that we have is
september . did it start earlier ?
* did et & s first have financial hedges in may , that is the first number that
we have ? who should i talk to there ?
* is the june and september rhythms number different that what we originally
calculated for the second and third quarter ? june must be as i recall it was
excluded at the time vs . the $ 24 mm now showing . are the differences
primarily due to the 100 % + volatility versus the 60 % + number that stinson
originally gave you ? have you asked him why he gave you what he did ? please
get jill erwin to help you revise the december number for ghost .
* there is lots of missing numbers for total return swaps . eugenio and gail
tholen to determine which swaps were in place in which months of 1999 and run
the appropriate models . if different models will need to be used in
different periods of the year for the same swap , lets get that information
out to aa and jan ."

0,"following the discussions i have had with louise and jay , this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in newco .
1 . for the first few weeks ( to a few months ) we continue to use infinity to update the curves at 2 pm . i will need to have one trader to execute , mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange ( cd $ etc . ) . louise , i hope you have this in your budget and headcount . i will need one junior trader ( and maybe two as things grow ) to help do this job . i have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk , if this goes forward .
2 . in the first few weeks , jay webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter , and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do , with significantly lower costs . we also will re - design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books , to make it simpler and easier . to ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift - reallocation , i propose a method where , every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter ( less any transaction expenses ) . i would expect that , the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio , while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly ( as we start making money ) .
hope this answers the questions . we will have the curves at the right time , done by the trading group . we will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies . we intend to allocate small var to that risk management . we would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk .
just to be very clear , while i am happy to manage this risk ( with extra help ) , i am primarily interested in the running of power options and structured products .

john / louise -
given that under the current plan , the bank will be trading our interest rate risk , i doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to newco . in order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve .
should i plan on just getting access to reuters and setting a curve off of libor on my own ?

0,"the following table summarizes the pv quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the navy yard . you may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates ( unitized ) on the value of the transaction . because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price , an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal .
as a reminder , the base valuation makes very reasonable ( and conservative ) assumptions regarding increases in pipeline demand charges over the term of the deal .

volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
deal .
he has not had a response from legal yet ."
