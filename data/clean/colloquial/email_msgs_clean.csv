kevin , thanks for the document we will have it reviewed in the event ppl
opts to
use it to meet any credit requirements .
i do have one question that might have been addressed at the informational
sessions . based on the open season documents , red lake will interconnect
with
both el paso and tw at a minimum , with other points to be determined based
on
interest . i was wondering if there had been any discussions with either
pipeline
about the impact of adding this interconnection . i know that may be a loaded
questions , but based on historic flows , in order to guarantee firm
deliveries
from that receipt point , a shipper would have to move its primary receipt
point
to the red lake interconnection ( from say san juan or east of thoreau areas
on
tw ) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines . sorry for the
rambling question , but in valuating the asset , the question of
transportation
inevitably comes up .
thanks
david

per your request , please see below :
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
new facsimile machine information
please take a look @ the following and let me know , which fax machine you
choose or if you need information on something smaller , then i will have the
vendor contact you directly to finalise installation . an enron director or
above { with signature authority to legally bind enron to a contract } will
have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be
installed . delivery times on new machines are normally 3 - 5 working days but
either vendor listed below will be able to provide a "" loaner "" should you have
a business need . please discuss the fax machine install date with the rep
when ordering the equipment .
if there is no existing fax line present , you will need to send a notes - mail
to the move team { erica @ x 3 - 3185 or janelle @ x 5 - 7917 } requesting the
installation of a new fax line . the move team can be found in the notes - mail
"" ect address book "" .
if you are an ees employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ees budget control . contact susan mcleroy @ x 5 - 8066 or via notes - mail .
if you are an ebs employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ebs purchasing & budget control . contact paula corey @ x 3 - 9948 or martha
reyna @ x 3 - 3491 . you can reach both of these people via notes - mail .
if you are an ena employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ena finance & budget control . contact lorie belsha @ x 3 - 9617 or via
notes - mail .
a note on the fax machines listed below :
all the machines listed below come with a 2 nd paper tray and upgraded memory
{ maxed by model ~ see below } as an enron standard from each vendor .
all the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33 . 6 kbps versus
the canon laserclass 7500 { example only } @ 14 . 4 kbps = new fax machine should
be noticeably quicker .
document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the
canon laserclass 7500 { example only }
maintenance = models listed below have maintenance / repair coverage included
in monthly $ total . there is no separate agreement ! toner / drum cartridges +
paper + line charges are extra { not quoted }
contract pricing can change without warning , so please let me know asap if a
vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various
models .
if the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment , here are some
considerations :
no more than 20 people per fax machine = take a look @ the fax machine
placement on eb 30 or eb 31 .
disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33 . 6 k modem and jbig
compression { or equivalent } .
look for memory upgrades & 2 nd paper tray included in monthly cost . { models
quoted are loaded } .
maintenance is to be included in monthly cost { models quoted are covered } .

{ i . e . heavy = 40 faxes per day @ 20 pages / 60 faxes per day @ 2 - 3 pages or a

contract details
the fax programs are an agreement between each end user of the fax machine
and the relevant vendor , as follows :
pitney bowes

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
please note the following
the facsimile machine agreement is between the enron business unit / department

processing or payment of facsimile { fax } machine invoices .
in order to return any old fax machine equipment , you must contact the
leasing company that supplied the equipment and send them a certified letter
that terminates the agreement . if you terminate a contract within the
original agreement period , you may be liable for penalty charges as a lot of
fax machines are on a non - cancellable lease agreement . the vendor who
supplied the fax equipment will be able to let you know of any outstanding $
amounts for your existing equipment .
if you are asked to pay outstanding $ amounts , be aware that some vendors
include the cost of outright purchase of the old fax equipment = from the
contracts i have reviewed so far , you are under no obligation to purchase the
old equipment .

charges for fax machines are dependant upon manufacturer & model , with the
person responsible for the fax machine , paying the invoice . you must notify
the vendor of any changes relating to fax machine assignment { even if it is
within the same group } = who the machine has been reassigned to { contact
name } , the new contact phone # and the location of the machine .

dear vince kaminski ,
i was auditing prof dyer ' s real options class on thursday when you spoke
on enron ' s activities in this area . i would be interested in exploring the
possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
and in anticipation of enron ' s business requirements . i ' m currently
working in the development and application of real options methodology at
schlumberger . in particular i ' ll be speaking at an industry real options
valuation conference in london ( http : / / www . iqpc . co . uk / finance / rov / ) and i
just had the paper accepted for publication in operations research . could
you pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at ?
thanks in advance ,

i ' m trying to figure out why two deals entered to cover losses at kyrene for the 31 st of may didn ' t make it into the preschedule sheet . i ' m looking for the following deals :
627022 - stsw buys epe

hlh - 2 mw @ $ 0
comments : losses at kyrene
627025 - stsw buys epe
pv
hlh - 76 mw @ $ 170
comments : delivery at kyrene
these deals are pulling into the carp report , but are not shown in either the preschedule or real time el paso models . therefore , enpower is showing more volume and a higher total cost for the day than our model . can you give me a hint on this one ?
thanks ,

we're accustomed to he said it's not an easy thing to remove the security screws and take it out of the building it makes you very aware of two things the extraordinary extent we depend on the

picasso's weeping woman from the wall of the national gallery of victoria the thieves brazenly put an official looking typewritten card in the painting's place which in an embarrassing security lapse

up with the poor treatment of arts by the state government of the day the group's ransom was a demand that an art prize for young artists be established police recovered the work which shows picasso's lover dora maar mourning the bombing of guernica during the spanish civil war in a locker at the spencer street station a few days later the thieves were never caught picasso also proved a magnet for

officials from the carabinieri paramilitary police more than escapenumber artifacts including columns and mosaics had been excavated from the site and used to decorate a hotel complex nearby while other pieces had been placed in a dump to be reused as construction material when police located the site workers were preparing to lay the foundations of the resort hotel on the remaining ruins said gen giovanni nistri the head of the art squad it would have been the final tombstone for this temple nistri said at a news conference in rome police identified two suspects for possible prosecution on charges of failing to alert authorities about the find damaging the site and illegal possession of archaeological artifacts nistri said the two were not arrested italy is full of archaeological treasures many undiscovered and developers must report finds countless public and private projects have been scrapped or delayed over the years as state archaeologists descended on building sites and it is not uncommon for developers to fail to report a discovery and plow through ancient treasures the discovery of the greek temple is of extraordinary historic and artistic value and experts believe that it may be part of a larger ancient settlement the carabinieri said in a statement the ruins are one big puzzle for scholars as the area was previously thought to be devoid of such important public buildings said archaeological superintendent giovanni guzzo the temple mixes two styles of greek architecture the austere doric and the more graceful decorations of ionic it was probably built

montreal the estate of the late montreal art dealer max stern has won a round in its legal case against an elderly rhode island woman in possession of a painting that the estate's lawyers say stern was forced to sell under duress from the nazis escapenumber years ago in providence r i u s district judge mary lisi granted a request earlier this month by the estate that ordered german born maria luise bissonnette to stop moving the painting the escapenumberth century girl from the sabiner mountains by franz xaver winterhalter it came to light last september that bissonnette had sent the artwork to germany in april escapenumber shortly before the stern estate launched a suit in a rhode island federal court for the painting's restitution the two sides negotiated for months to try to reach a settlement before the estate took the case to court lisi also ordered bissonnette to permit representatives of the estate to see the painting at its current location to determine its condition and to ensure that it is being stored properly bissonnette can only move the painting again with the court's permission the two sides had tried unsuccessfully to work out a deal that would have allowed the estate to inspect the painting without seeking a court order bissonnette had originally agreed only to allow the estate representatives to view the painting at her german lawyers' offices stern a dusseldorf gallery owner was ordered by the gestapo to sell the winterhalter along with about escapenumber other artworks at an auction conducted by lempertz in cologne in escapenumber the estate claims he received only a small fraction of their value which was largely taxed away he fled to england after this final liquidation of his inventory stern who owned the dominion gallery in montreal for more than escapenumber years died in escapenumber and left his estate to concordia and mcgill universities and the hebrew univesity of jerusalem which have created a foundation in his name more than two years ago concordia launched a worldwide search headed by clarence epstein to find the confiscated stern collection which includes possibly another escapenumber works that the dealer was forced to sell after escapenumber the stern estate's legal team headed by washington d c based thomas kline claim that the winterhalter rightfully belongs to the estate because it was effectively stolen under the nazi government's laws excluding jews from trade in art the estate told the rhode island court that a german court recognized in escapenumber that the lempertz auction was coerced girl from the sabiner mountains is also listed as confiscated by the art loss register in london bissonnette escapenumber who has lived in providence for many years says she inherited the work from her stepfather physician karl wilharm she says he paid for it and she has the receipt to prove it the estate's own research found that lempertz recorded that it sold the winterhalter to wilharm for the equivalent of escapenumber escapenumber but stern probably receive only two to five per cent of that epstein said the estate alleges that wilharm was a high ranking member of the storm troopers and a nazi party member the painting's whereabouts came to epstein's attention when it was put up for sale on the ebay website in january escapenumber by a rhode island auction house to which bissonnette had consigned it although she holds the hereditary title of baroness the widowed bissonnette said she tried to sell the painting to pay for cancer treatment the estate's lawyers charge that she spirited the painting out of the united states to an unknown location in germany to pre empt litigation here they surmise that she hoped to get a german court to act and possibly receive a more sympathetic hearing the estates say there had been an understanding that the painting would be left at the rhode island auction house until the dispute was resolved among the evidence filed in court was a postal receipt showing that bissonnette put the painting's value at escapenumber us which the estate's lawyers say may have violated u s customs laws the rhode island auctioneer has said it was worth between escapenumber escapenumber and escapenumber escapenumber us bissonnette had earlier said through her lawyer that she would only sell the painting to the stern estate for escapenumber escapenumber bissonnette told the boston globe that she didn't know the painting's value and underestimated it to discourage theft during shipment montreal lawyer robert vineberg executor of the estate said the foundation had offered bissonnette a relatively small sum as a goodwill gesture considering her modest means and health although legally he maintains she is owed nothing in the globe interview published before the court upheld the estate's request bissonnette insisted she and her parents had done nothing wrong she said her stepfather was a country doctor during world war ii and did not support the nazi regime she said the nazi police demanded use of a former bookbinding factory he owned outside munich after the u s district court decision bissonnette's lawyer john weltman of boston reportedly withdrew from the case over differences with his client he claimed he had never counselled her to send the painting to germany and only knew about its movement after the

museum to change display casting canadian vets as 'war criminals' james zombie canwest news service wednesday june escapenumber escapenumber ottawa a special senate subcommittee is asking the canadian war museum to change part of a controversial display some veterans have claimed makes them look like war criminals at issue is a second world war exhibit that contains a single panel describing an enduring controversy and raises moral issues over the role of canadian bombing squadrons that attacked german cities in an attempt to wipe out the nazi war machine liberal senator joseph day chair of the subcommittee on veterans affairs suggested the museum has a responsibility to recognize it has offended some people and should change the display there were no suggestions as to how the museum should go about doing that even as the politicians raised no qualms about the accuracy of the facts and information presented don't try to change history we're not into rewriting history day said tell the story and tell the facts but tell it in a way that you're not offending unintentionally a large segment of the canadian public the facility's president victor rabinovitch wasn't available tuesday and wasn't expected to offer any comment until there was time to further review the senators' recommendation the display panel accompanied by photos including one of dead civilians on the street following an allied bombing notes the mass raids against germany resulted in vast destruction and heavy loss of life the value and morality of the strategic bomber offensive against germany remains bitterly contested bomber command's aim was to crush civilian morale and force germany to surrender by destroying its cities and industrial installations it says although bomber command and american attacks left escapenumber escapenumber germans dead and more than five million homeless the raids resulted in only small reductions of german war production until late in the war day said the subcommittee was troubled by the fact much of the exhibit was dedicated to the heroic activities of individual airmen and crews and then you get in an academic debate on the last panel which calls into question all of these exploits of the individuals that were highlighted in the rest of the display asked whether he believed a museum was a place for academic debate day agreed it was i think that's all part of the museum's responsibility he said it was just that the juxtaposition of various facts and pictures seemed to confuse the two i don't think it was intended but that seems to be the case complaints from veterans about the tone of the panel first surfaced in escapenumber soon after the museum opened following threats of boycott from a coalition of veterans' groups the facility undertook what it called the exceptional step of seeking input from external expert historians four of them filed reports the museum said agreed with the contention that the display in its entirety presented an accurate view of the air war in europe two raised concerns about the tone and balance of the one panel the museum said in march that it would not change the panel adding its decision was

vince ,
last week i was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an enron employee . he has a phd and several years research and lab experience .
richard is afraid that being a phd is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an mba . i was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in richard , or if you feel i should encourage him to go back to school . i am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so i apologize if this request is way off base .
thank you for your help ,

0,"enrononline / netcoonline status update :
- "" netcoonline "" will be distinct from enrononline , with much the same functionality and a refreshed look .
- we will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on enrononline . please contact us if you will need different products from what was on enrononline .
- we have prepared a list of top customers in cdn and us gas and power ( copy attached ) , which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed password applications .
- to speed the registration process , top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their password application .
- we are intending to use a simple , online gtc , which can be superceded by a negotiated master agreement , as with enrononline .
- internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval .

subject : re - start / integration planning
we have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the re - start / integration plans for netco . so far , we have primarily focussed on the mid / back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors . several plans are in the final stages of completion including : -
+ infrastructure jenny rub
+ development jay webb
+ enrononline webb / forster
+ hr david oxley
+ cash management tom myers
+ credit debbie brackett
the rest will be completed shortly .
we now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus . john and i would like to receive the plans "" re - start / integration "" plans by january 7 th , 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups . the focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible . i have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but i thought it might help . please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually .

i spoke with brian nichols about the august preliminary invoice . there
appears to be a problem for august 28 & 29 - the volumes are much too low .
either there were deliveries off of centana that we are missing , or there is
a problem with the hpl data . i am having brain fade and cannot remember the
name of the person in the measurement department to contact , so maybe you
could look into this and have it corrected .
thanks

an undisclosed price in excess of escapenumber million the escapenumber year old portrait head of a king made in what is now southern nigeria came from a paris dealer who offered it to the minneapolis museum which has been seeking great objects for its already renowned collection of african art it's a very exciting acquisition said william griswold the museum's director he declined to say how much the museum paid but said it was in excess of seven figures benin bronzes as they are known are rare and considered a high point in pre colonial african culture by unusual coincidence another benin bronze head from the same era will be up for auction at sotheby's in new york on may escapenumber and is expected to sell for between escapenumber million and escapenumber escapenumber million the escapenumber inch head which joins three other benin pieces owned by the museum was probably made between escapenumber and escapenumber and depicts an unidentified king or oba wearing a necklace of coral beads the institute recently built a escapenumber million addition primarily to expand its escapenumberth century collection and it continues to buy art across the board including contemporary prints photos and paintings given the extraordinary cost of escapenumberth century art the museum expects it will have to rely on gifts for many of its acquisitions in that field there are many more

martha lufkin posted escapenumber may escapenumber the escapenumberth annual conference on legal issues in museum administration attended by museum staff lawyers and others was held in philadelphia on escapenumber escapenumber march targeting recent prickly issues that have made us museum officials sweat the course gave top billing to stolen antiquities claims what to ask to conduct due diligence before acquisition whether to settle or fight a claim and how to draft your legal agreement with a foreign government to transfer do not say return the antiquities it seeks the course tackled other problems including legal and public relations crises the use of donors names to recognise large gifts tax compliance museum mergers and copyright the conference was co sponsored by the smithsonian institution with the cooperation of the american association of museums pay your top people reasonably tax laws impose a costly excise tax on public charity executives who receive excess compensation and on board members who knowingly approve it says celia roady a lawyer at the firm morgan lewis bockius llp washington dc bad press about executive pay can lead to a drop in public contributions she warns ms roady advises that museums follow irs rules to ensure that executive pay is presumed to be reasonable the compensation decision must be made by an independent board or committee the board or compensation committee must rely on market data on comparable pay for the position and the board or committee must document its compensation decision in the minutes in addition says ms roady the board should be fully engaged in the compensation decision all elements of compensation should be disclosed to the board and the board should play a role in setting expenses and privileges sell everything from the fountain to the new wing many museums have minimum donation policies for the use of donor names larry dubinski vice president of development and general counsel of the franklin institute philadelphia suggests an inventory of new opportunities start with everything possible that can be named from the water fountain to the stairs to the new wing museums should benchmark gift levels with peer institutions such as the local symphony orchestra to make sure that the minimum donations required for name use are realistic mr dubinski says one you have secured a gift invite the donor to a meaningful public ceremony which includes the donor s family to encourage continued giving but what about deviating from an agreement to use a donor s name this may be desirable when circumstances change says elizabeth r salasko associate general counsel of the university of pennsylvania philadelphia the gift agreement should allow a change if use of the name becomes detrimental for example seton hall university s kozlowski hall was renamed jubilee hall after the donor l dennis kozlowski was convicted of grand larceny mr kozlowski asked that his name be removed to avoid distraction but after former sotheby s chief a alfred taubman was convicted of auction house anti trust violations brown university kept his name and money for its center for public policy and american institutions because the gift was given before the criminal allegations other future changes in circumstance could include a need to rebuild or renovate in such cases some donors will want joint recognition with a future donor when the crisis hits call your lawyer lawyers from the smithsonian institution si getty museum and metropolitan museum which have withstood significant recent negative press gave tips on handling crises john huerta general counsel at si described a public firestorm over its escapenumber agreement with showtime networks intended to disseminate more information about si activities when press reports wrongly claimed that the deal would cut access to si collections congress slashed the si s budget and called for hearings while the si was able to correct the wrong impression huerta advises creating a strategic communications plan to anticipate negative responses from constituencies and head them off a separate crisis management plan should also be created to make clear who will respond to criticism in a disaster the j paul getty trust has faced a barrage of bad press over its antiquities collection and the conduct of its executives former antiquities curator marion true is currently on trial in rome accused of conspiring to receive illicitly excavated artefacts and former getty trust president barry munitz resigned in february escapenumber after the los angeles times reported a misuse of trust funds including lavish spending and other improprieties later confirmed by an investigation by the california state attorney general peter c erichsen general counsel and secretary of the getty trust noted that any chief executive or board member could conceivably misbehave or be subject to allegations of misbehaviour in dealing with the press and public in a museum crisis lawyers should recognise that you may in fact be only at the beginning of a bad story which may unfold unpredictably when pressure builds for a quick response take your time mr erichsen says and stick to the facts he added that a new model is emerging for the general counsel as a whistleblower who divorces himself from the organisation and becomes a truth teller but the lawyer should also be fair to the organisation and guide the governing board he says sharon h cott secretary and general counsel at the metropolitan described the press coverage surrounding the metropolitan s return in escapenumber of antiquities sought by italy as obsessive she said legal counsel should be joined at the hip with the press office during a crisis and should communicate with the governing board and press team as the situation unfolds to avoid surprises until an answer is clear the lawyer s role may be to advise a response of no comment to a press question controlling copyright can a museum control reproductions of objects in its collection which are not protected by copyright because they are in the public domain to reproduce such an object the user must have access to it which public domain status does not guarantee says lauryn h guttenplan associate general counsel of the smithsonian institution when a museum grants a license limiting reproduction of an object in the public domain are the restrictions enforceable no court decisions directly address this question says copyright lawyer simon j frankel of the firm covington burling llp san francisco but the general rule is that reproduction limits under a contract are enforceable even if exceeding any reproduction limits under the copyright law he says but even if they are legal mr frankel asks are limits on reproducing

dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new
big blue ?
by mike jude and nancy meachim
the terms  & asp  8 and  & ibm  8 may have more in common than being three -
letter acronyms .
remember big blue of the early  + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized
computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications
that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure ,
especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with
computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to
maintain .
of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity .
and users weren  , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a
bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell ,
so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into
intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the
glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion .
looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder
how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn  , t so far off .
thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized
computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application
management .
the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server
advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning
software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but
asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed
programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the
principle remains the same : central control makes support much more
efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ?
to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old
centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn  , t just host and support
an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary
network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network
service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the  + 60 s , if
the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an
hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow .
nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a
minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the
world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  + 60 s shop .
however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the  + 60 s
to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in
an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy  , s vision , users would sit down
at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start
working . what did the  + 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing !
so you are probably wondering , what is the point ? just this : ibm  , s
problem was leaving the customer out of the equation . and look what
happened . customers rebelled . they didn  , t buy ibm  , s spiel . it became
the  & in  8 thing to hate ibm . why ? because the guys in white smocks
couldn  , t spell service and didn  , t care about customers .
to be successful , asps need to learn from the past . they need to tattoo
service on the forehead of each of their employees . there are too many
choices , today , for customers to put up with inferior service . that  , s
one big difference from the  + 60 s . customers now can literally choose
any service provider in the world . just being big doesn  , t cut it these
days .

inside my function the existence of y similarly if i pass z as the value of the argument i want to be able to see inside the function that z doesn't exist the missing function just checks whether the argument is missing in my case the argument is not missing but the object may not exist and the way you use the exists function inside the user defined function doesn't test the argument to the user defined function it's just hard coded for the object y so i'm sorry if i wasn't clear before and i hope this is clear now perhaps what i'm attempting to do is unavailable because it's a bad

the following is a response to bill ' s question : "" when does the tariff require the lc to be renewed ? do we have some time to wait until mid - december ? ""
also attached to this email is lori poffenroth ' s november 9 memo which sets forth lori ' s calculations based on wsp / ppa ' s formulas set forth in their tariffs for initial amounts , revised amounts , recommended october 31 amounts , and estimated december 31 amounts .
all of the wsp ' s and the ppa ' s prudential requirements allow the wsp ' s and the ppa to reevaluate edcc ' s credit limit and / or request additional security from time to time . while the following sets out in more detail the manner in which each wsp and the ppa can do this , all of the prudential requirements are the same in the following two respects : ( 1 ) if at any time edcc ' s financial obligations to the wsp / ppa ( the "" financial obligations "" ) exceed the existing credit limit ( or a certain percentage thereof ) , the wsp / ppa has the right to request additional security ( the "" additional security "" ) ; and ( 2 ) if edcc fails to post the additional security within the requisite time period , the wsp / ppa reserves the right to suspend service to edcc .
note that , as of today , no wsp / ppa has requested additional security .
however , as soon as possible , the following needs to occur in those instances where the october 31 amount exceeds the existing amount : ( 1 ) we should post the additional security now ; or ( 2 ) we put ourselves in a position to be able to post the additional security within the requisite time period . consequently , we do have some time to wait until mid - december provided that ( 2 ) has occurred .
as at december 31 , we must post the december 31 amount .

as at october 31 , the financial obligations have been calculated to be $ 300 , 000 and the posted security is $ 300 , 000 ; therefore , no additional security is currently required . as at december 31 , the financial obligations have been calculated to be $ 450 , 000 and the posted security will have expired ; therefore $ 450 , 000 of additional security will be required at that time . such additional security will be due within 5 days of atco ' s request .

sorry for the confusion .
this is a second tanker on which very few details
are available . the lng group is working as we speak
to provide some information for joe sutton before
his departure for paris this ( tuesday ) afternoon .
there is no dash on this 2 nd tanker yet . i asked dave gorte
on monday to send me one and was not told that
he can provide me with the mystic lady dash as the closest

subject : re : lng may 19 decision
john ,
this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .
1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash
and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island
project ( please , see point 2 ) .
2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest
( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island
transaction . the next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .
a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :
a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term
contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .
the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the
long - term
contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are
setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .
b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension
option of
5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we
have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for
such a long tenor . this is
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread
and
i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .
one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the
first
5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .
c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market .
d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island
deal
( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .
long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail
that
correlates very well with brent .

i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .
anyway with greg moving to his
new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the
eastern hemishere plus lng .
i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for
lng and lng ship values . i also understand
that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far
away ) . anway i understand this
is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you
please let me know where you stand now ?
i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .
look forward to connecting with you vince .

0,embarrasingly i don't know awk or sed but r's code seems to be shorter for most tasks than python which is my basis for comparison it's true that r's more powerful data structures usually aren't necessary for the data cleaning but sometimes in the filtering process i will pick out lines that contain certain data in which case i have to convert text to numbers and perform operations like which min order etc so in that sense i like to have r's vectorized notation and the objects functions that support it as far as some of the tasks you described i've tried transcribing them to r i know you provided only the simplest examples but even in these cases i think r's functions for handling these situations exemplify their usefulness in this step of the analysis but perhaps you would argue that this code is too long in any event it will still save the trouble of keeping track of an extra intermediate file passed between awk and r escapenumber the numbers of fields in each line equivalent to

true a couple of comments though escapenumber r's rich data structures are likely to be superfluous mostly at the sanitisation stage one is working with flat files row column this straightforward format is often easier to handle using simple programs for the kind of basic filtering needed rather then getting into the heavier programming constructs of r escapenumber as follow on and contrast at the same time very often what should be a nice flat file with no rough edges is not if there are variable numbers of fields per line r will not handle it straightforwardly you can force it in but it's more elaborate there are related issues as well a if someone entering data into an excel table lets their cursor wander outside the row col range of the table this can cause invisible entities to be planted in the extraneous cells when saved as a csv this file then has variable numbers of fields per line and possibly also extra lines with arbitrary blank fields cat datafile csv awk 'begin fs n nf

published may escapenumber escapenumber the united states is angry with thailand for encouraging copycats to undercut american intellectual property the commerce department in washington wants thai officials to reverse their controversial decision to break patents on several drugs used in treating aids heart ailments and cancer bristol myers squibb merck and abbott laboratories the three u s drug makers that may be affected by the thai decision on compulsory licensing together had escapenumber billion in cash from operations last year that is a lot of money riding on intellectual property it's quite natural for these companies to detest compulsory licensing in which a patented or copyrighted product is given to others to manufacture to bring down its cost thailand's move to tap generic suppliers for key medicines it says it has imported the first batch of merck's patented aids drug efavirenz from india at half the price is being decried as dangerous lobbyists for pharmaceutical companies say that other countries may be inspired to follow suit as brazil already has jeopardizing future investments in drug discovery in this debate between protecting knowledge and saving lives what is important to remember is that neither thailand nor brazil has done anything illegal nor are they posing a credible threat to future drug discovery compulsory licensing of drugs is a legitimate right of any member of the world trade organization a member government can take a patented medicine and give it to someone else to manufacture after efforts to negotiate a lower price with the patent holder have failed even then the owner of the intellectual property must be given adequate remuneration thailand exercised its right late last year and ended up on the u s government's so called priority watch list which leaves it vulnerable to trade reprisals leave aside the politics of international commerce and consider the economics of developing a new drug finding a blockbuster means

from what s j liebowitz an economist and professor at the university of texas at dallas calls the economic paradox of nonrivalrous goods pricing a nonrivalrous product is one where there is no cost to the society of letting one more individual consume a product as long as he or she is willing to pay the cost of manufacturing the product in the case of patented drugs this is the cost of copying a bunch of chemicals into a blank tablet or capsule however if an aids drug can be treated as a pure public good why should private capital bother investing in the uncertain business of discovering a newer better one a legally enforced product patent solves the problem albeit unsatisfactorily it has an inbuilt bias against poor people because at least some of them must be excluded via higher prices as consumers in order to create an incentive for privately funded discovery of new drugs giving this unfair system an occasional jolt may not bring innovation to a halt a u s district court

economists michele boldrin and david levine have made a compelling case against patents and copyrights in their book against intellectual monopoly the authors claim that cerebral assets are different from physical ones legal defense of the ownership rights of a cow or a factory helps everyone the same protection when applied to ideas hampers innovation the original napster the music swapping service that shut down in escapenumber amid copyright disputes with record companies jumps to mind but you could as easily look at james watt boldrin and levine say during the period when watt had patents on steam engines britain added escapenumber horsepower every year in the escapenumber years after the expiry of patents more than escapenumber escapenumber horsepower of steam engines were produced every year it's time to stop the acrimonious blame game where governments and nongovernment organizations like doctors without borders accuse drug companies of predatory pricing while the latter cry themselves hoarse about being robbed of the just rewards for their large risks efforts must now be directed at deriving an acceptable framework for compulsory licensing with a certifiable third party process the idea of separating compensation from ownership which is what compulsory licensing does does not appeal to those who dislike government interference in markets they rightly note that it is a halfway house bob dylan gets a cut every time someone releases a cover version of his songs through a mechanical licensing process but he cannot stop anyone from having a go at knockin' on heaven's door yet compulsory licensing has its positives the very threat prompts brand name drug makers to start offering price discounts in thailand abbott novartis and merck have offered price concessions so as a bargaining tool compulsory licensing achieves a better balance between innovators' expectations and patients' rights the united states which has used compulsory licensing to break down monopolies and keep its economy competitive should take a more lenient view of thailand's move it isn't all that odious ip health mailing list ip health lists essential org http lists essential

0,speakup does use modules and it can be statically compiled into kernel instead that's not a problem the serial ports however only support real serial ports not usb serial which is becoming a problem as i said a few months ago the whole usb mess can be statically compiled including the usb core the host controller and even usb serial devices audio devices and synth drivers like the dtlk for example so in theory it should be possible to boot and get speech output with changes to speakup as it is now the code refers to the standard serial port addresses and irqs and the communication code is rsescapenumber specific so this what i mean about abstraction an abstract interface does not implement anything it only defines the implementation can be anything as long as it follows the interface so basically there needs to be a layer of code in between the serial port code and the code that writes to it one interface with several implementations rsescapenumber serial usb serial and potential for any other kind of implementation and my argument was that the same could be done on the user side pressing a certain key does some thing currently assumed to be standard keyboard but would be nice if abstract interface where the keyboard is one type of controller other devices could trigger same i'm mostly thinking about mobile pervasive systems where you might want to read a message or email not type and your device is in your pocket so you have a little controller sort of like a game pad where you can move between messages and read them etc or get phone numbers from a list if the interface to the synth is generic then there are all kinds of possibilities i will be working on this kind of thing with speech and i am still contemplating whether or not it needs to be kernel space on an embedded device you really don't need to see all the boot messages because it will load kernel from flash and will always work if i find a way to adapt this code to work on arm then i might use it but i actually think i could do the same thing entirely in user space boot is much simpler than pc and very fixed in nature ie once done it shouldn't change no need to support gazillions of types of hardware etc i like the idea of being able to hear the console output but then i might end up just using usb serial console and having a microcontroller providing a terminal function in other words both the speech and keyboard functions if done that way it would possibly miss a very small amount of boot messages but not many it would be the same as using a terminal program with your pc connected to another pc with usb serial dongle and watching the other machine boot spie speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

- ubs do not want us to show "" ubswenergy . com "" - they require "" www . ubswenergy . com "" ( no caps ) or "" ubswenergy . com "" ( no "" www "" ) .
- this means that for the homepage to look right , we will change the name to "" ubs warburg energy "" beside the globe graphic .
- currently anticipate starting top 50 marketing for pa ' s by tomorrow morning ( ubs required changes on splash page ) .
- some traders in the market have started to refer to us as ub sol . although the low - profile approach we discussed made sense , on further reflection , i think we need to aggressively promote a positive short name for the system , to avoid the "" sol "" connotation . even "" ubs energy "" is a lot of syllables . we are working on finding some alternative ( perhaps which don ' t use "" ubs "" in the name , as that seems to be a sensitive point ) . if we are to do this , we will need to lobby at a level higher than where i have been so far . if you agree with my concern , some higher level contact might be in order ; perhaps with some of the people you have been meeting ?

ssb conference call
tuesday , february 13 , 2001
2 : 00 pm est
beyond california : the power however , the
markets foretell stronger prices across the country in 2001 .
we continue to recommend the power producers , based on both our power price
and spark spread analyses , which show strengthening spark spreads in the
united states , despite the record highs recently seen in the natural gas
markets . we highlight calpine , nrg energy , and mirant .
our volatility indices demonstrate a dramatic shift in historical volatility
to the western hubs and away from the midwestern markets of 1998 - 99 . we
expect volatility to persist in the west , likely accompanied by higher
volatility in the remainder of the country in 2001 . this benefits energy
merchants , and we highlight enron , dynegy , duke , and el paso .

congressional panels to probe enron ' s accounting , trading
washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - senate and house
committees will investigate the collapse of enron corp and
consider new regulations for electricity and natural - gas trading .
enron , the largest energy trader , is expected to file for
chapter 11 protection after the collapse of a planned merger with
dynegy inc .
the house energy committee will hold hearings as early as
next month to scrutinize the accounting practices and earnings
reports of enron , said ken johnson , a panel spokesman . the senate
energy committee may begin looking in january at more federal
oversight of trading .
` ` when you have such a spectacular event as the collapse of a
company that controlled 50 percent of the natural - gas and
electricity trading , we ' re going to have some thoughts on that , ' '
said bill wicker , a spokesman for the senate energy committee .
enron ' s importance in energy trading and questions about its
accounting practices require an investigation , said senate
majority leader tom daschle of south dakota .
` ` i don ' t know that anybody knows yet just how this happened
and how it happened so quickly , ' ' he told reporters on capitol
hill . ` ` it raises some very serious questions . ' '
the unraveling of enron , which is saddled with $ 15 billion in
publicly held debt , began in october . shareholders ' equity was
reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the way the company accounted
for outside partnerships it created . the announcement prompted
lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange
commission .

nymex tells members enron trades must be approved ( update 2 )
( adds analyst quote in fourth paragraph , enron share price in
sixth paragraph . )
new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - new york mercantile exchange
president j . robert collins told brokers on the largest energy
exchange ' s trading floor that they could not accept orders from
enron corp . unless they receive written authorization from an
exchange clearing member .
the order is effective immediately and will ` ` remain in
effect until further notice from the exchange , ' ' according to a
fax collins sent today to member firms . a copy of the fax was
obtained by bloomberg news . exchange officials did not immediately
return phone calls .
enron ' s worsening financial condition has made many clearing
members , which back trades on the exchange for a fee , wary of
taking on additional business from enron . the nymex order aims to
alert independent floor brokers that clearing members who once
freely accepted enron trades may no longer be so willing , analysts
said .
nymex is ` ` reminding everyone that it ' s not business as usual
when it comes to enron , ' ' said tim evans , senior energy analyst at
ifr pegasus in new york , a unit of thomson corp . ` ` for enron , it
mean slower order execution - - as if they don ' t have enough
handicaps already . ' '
enron may be forced to file for bankruptcy to liquidate
assets to pay off some of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt ,
analyst said . enron shares fell 24 cents to 37 cents in afternoon
trading . that ' s down from about $ 80 at the beginning of this year .
covering enron debts
under exchange rules , clearing members would be forced to
cover enron ' s obligations if the firm defaulted on its positions .
many energy traders , including rivals mirant corp . and aquila
inc . , already have reduced the number of trades they ' re doing with
enron in the over - the - counter markets , which involve direct trades
between companies that don ' t carry the financial guarantees of
regulated commodity exchanges .
the new york exchange yesterday said it will raise margins on
its natural gas and crude oil futures contracts at the close of
trading today . margins are deposits traders must make with the
exchange when buying or selling futures contracts to ensure
obligations will be met .
while the exchange gave no reason for the increase , the
decision followed a day of wide changes in natural gas prices . the
swings began after dynegy inc . abandoned plans to purchase enron ,
once the biggest gas trader .
dynegy ceo says he ' d rather have enron pipeline than $ 1 . 5 bln
2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 56 ( new york )
dynegy ceo says he ' d rather have enron pipeline than $ 1 . 5 bln
houston , nov . 29 , ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . chairman chuck
watson said he would rather take over an enron pipeline than get
back the $ 1 . 5 billion investment that entitles dynegy to the line .
watson said dynegy expects to take over operation of the
16 , 500 - mile northern natural pipeline system by dec . 19 .
chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , gave enron
$ 1 . 5 billion to help the cash - strapped company stay in business .
the investment , part of dynegy ' s plan to buy enron , was backed
by the northern natural system . dynegy backed out of the merger
yesterday , and said it would exercise its right to take over the
line .
watson said he hopes that northern natural employees will
continue to operate the pipeline after dynegy takes ownership .
italian banks fall on concern about enron exposure ( update 2 )

italian banks fall on concern about enron exposure ( update 2 )
( closes shares in second paragraph ; adds analyst comment from
eighth , estimates of exposure in 10 th . )
milan , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - intesabci spa and unicredito
italiano spa shares fell on investors ' concern that italian banks
may not recoup money lent to units of enron corp . if the largest
u . s . energy trader goes bankrupt .
intesabci , italy ' s biggest bank , fell 2 . 4 percent to 2 . 75
euros while unicredito , the no . 2 lender , lost 1 . 9 percent to 4 . 24
euros . banca nazionale del lavoro spa , the nation ' s sixth - largest
bank , dropped 1 . 4 percent to 2 . 55 .
` ` the theme of the day is to sell banks because they are
exposed to enron , ' ' said daniele savare , who helps manage 120
million euros ( $ 106 million ) at bipielle asset management . ` ` in
some cases , the reaction may be a bit overdone . ' '
dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed merger with
enron , leaving the houston - based company burdened with debt and
the likelihood of insolvency . some analysts said bankruptcy is
inevitable and may come as early as today . a bankruptcy filing by
enron , which reported more than $ 61 billion in assets , would be
the biggest chapter 11 reorganization in history .
` ` i ' ve heard intesa is the most exposed , to the tune of
between 400 billion and 500 billion lire ( $ 183 million - $ 229
million ) , ' ' said gianluca ferrari , who helps manage 260 million
euros in stocks at banca valsabbina in brescia .
gabrio gelmi , an intesa spokesman , confirmed enron is a
client of the bank , though he declined to comment on the size of
its exposure . luigi ferrari , a spokesman at san paolo - imi spa ,
said the exposure of italy ' s no . 3 bank was ` ` limited and under
control . ' ' he declined to give an amount .
diversified
officials at unicredito , banca nazionale del lavoro and banca
di roma spa were not immediately available for comment .
` ` it doesn ' t make sense to attribute the declines today
purely to the enron exposure , ' ' said luca comi , head of research
at eptasim . ` ` if it ' s just one company that ' s in trouble , banks
are sufficiently diversified that the impact is very limited . ' '
comi said san paolo had told him enron had borrowed 80
million euros as part of a 120 million - euro credit line . of the
loan , 50 million euros is guaranteed by enron assets , the analyst
said .
san paolo shares fell 1 percent to 12 . 41 euros .
other banks have higher exposure to enron , such as 168
million euros for intesa , banca nazionale del lavoro ' s 142 million
euros and 122 million euros at unicredito , investors said , citing
analysts ' reports .
argentine analysts , perez companc comment on tgs after enron
2001 - 11 - 29 15 : 55 ( new york )
buenos aires , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - eugenia benitez , an
energy analyst at allaria ledesma & cia , esteban marx , an analyst
at banco comafi , gustavo neffa , an analyst at bbva banco frances
sa and mario grandinetti , head of perez companc ' s institutional
relations , comment on the future of gas distributor transportadora
de gas del sur sa .
enron corp . , which together with perez companc owns 70
percent of tgs , may file for bankruptcy protection in the biggest
bankruptcy reorganization in history . the move may force the
largest u . s . energy trader to liquidate assets to pay some of its
$ 15 billion in publicly held debt .
eugenia benitez :
` ` the natural buyer is perez companc . there ' s definitely the
possibility of reaching a deal that would make perez the only
controlling shareholder of tgs .
` ` we would need to see how much tgs debt perez has . its debt
profile is relevant .
` ` the acquisition would be another step in perez ' strategy of
integrating all its operations in one holding . ' '
esteban marx :
` ` perez is the natural candidate , but i ' m not sure now is the
right time for perez to pour money into tgs , unless it can get it
really cheap . ' '
gustavo neffa :
` ` the only company that could make the sort of investment to
by the tgs stake is perez companc , but its a huge investment given
that tgs ' assets are worth about $ 1 billion .
` ` but it would definitely be the likely buyer . ' '
grandinetti :
` ` we ' re not permitted to buy enron ' s stake in tgs because of
rules that prevent us having a majority stake .
` ` if the law is modified , then yes we would consider it . but
there are also economic issues to consider . ' '

duke , williams among companies facing enron losses ( update 2 )
( updates total in second paragraph , adds closing stock price
in ninth paragraph and analyst comment in paragraph 12 th and 20 th
paragraphs . )
houston , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - duke energy corp . , j . p .
morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and a dozen other companies
together may lose more than $ 1 . 1 billion from the collapse of
enron corp .
electricity and natural gas companies said enron owed them
about $ 660 million as of yesterday , when dynegy inc . abandoned a
merger that deprived enron of cash it needs to avoid insolvency .
j . p . morgan , the bank that was enron ' s adviser on the failed
buyout , said it is owed $ 500 million for unsecured loans .
losses may grow as companies tally their exposure from
transactions with houston - based enron , the largest energy trader ,
with revenue last year of $ 100 billion . enron also manages power
supply for companies such as j . c . penney co . and eli lilly & co . ,
and owns pipelines and a fiber - optic telecommunications network .
some companies ` ` have positions that they ' re not owning up
to , ' ' said peter fusaro , president of global change associates
inc . , an energy research firm . ` ` enron had long - term deals on the
books , and these may take years to sort out . how could they not
have big exposure ? ' '
enron is poised to file the largest bankruptcy reorganization
in history . the company is saddled with more than $ 15 billion in
debt and had less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week . it must
pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is responsible for
another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated partnerships . the
company ' s credit - rating was downgraded to junk status yesterday .
` ` considering enron ' s size and clout , there are very few
companies in the energy business or electric utility companies
that have not done business with them , ' ' said jon cartwright , a
fixed - income analyst at raymond & james associates . ` ` i don ' t
believe that everyone could have gotten out of their exposure . ' '
limited payments
enron said yesterday it will continue payments necessary to
maintain its trading and other core energy businesses , while
suspending all others . it also resumed limited trading on its
enrononline internet market , after shutting down most of
yesterday .
the new york mercantile exchange , the largest energy market ,
tightened trading restrictions on enron in a move that members
said was made to limit the risk from any new business with the
company .
shares of enron fell 25 cents to 36 cents , compared with $ 70
a year ago .
if enron is unable to pay all it owes , duke and williams said
they would lose no more than $ 100 million each . duke , the largest
u . s . utility owner , didn ' t stop trading with enron until
yesterday , and warned that its earnings may be affected .
` ` we are closely monitoring this unfortunate situation to
determine if a provision against earnings is appropriate , ' '
richard j . osborne , duke ' s executive vice president and chief risk
officer , said in a statement today
` reassure investors '
energy companies that did business with enron are trying ` ` to
reassure investors that they ' re not going to go belly up as a
result of enron ' s demise , ' ' said gordon howald , an analyst at
credit lyonnais securities inc . ` ` investors still need to be
cautious about this industry , because there are a lot of
unanswered questions . ' '
reliant resources inc . said it faces $ 80 million in losses
from transactions with enron involving electricity and natural gas
sales .
dynegy said it faces $ 75 million in losses , though it plans
to exercise its option under the buyout agreement to take the
northern natural gas system in exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion
investment in enron . mirant corp . , an atlanta - based energy trader ,
said it would lose no more than $ 60 million .
aquila inc . , american electric power co . and el paso corp .
said each estimated their exposure to enron at $ 50 million .
more losses
centrica , the dominant u . k . natural - gas supplier , may write
off contracts worth $ 43 million if enron fails , the company said
in a statement . exelon corp . , owner of utilities in chicago and
philadelphia , said its exposure is less than $ 20 million .
dominion resources inc . , a power and gas utility said its
exposure for past sales is $ 11 million .
rwe , europe ' s fourth - biggest utility owner , said its open
trading positions with enron are ` ` much less ' ' than $ 8 . 9 million .
st . mary land and exploration co . , a denver - based natural - gas
producer , said it has hedged $ 4 . 17 million of production with
enron through 2003 . western gas resources inc . said it faces $ 2 . 6
million in possible losses .
nrg energy inc . announced a potential liability of $ 10
million through its energy trading with enron , and plains
resources inc . said its exposure through to the end of next year
was about $ 630 , 000 .
companies that did business with enron ` ` relied for the most
part on the rating agencies ' ' to determine if enron was
financially sound , credit lyonnais ' howald said . enron ` ` was
investment grade , and they were solidly investment grade for some
time . i don ' t think you can fault these companies for doing
business with a company that represented 20 percent ' ' of the
market .
some companies , such as calpine corp . , said they had no
exposure to enron .
j . p . morgan has a $ 400 million loan secured by enron ' s
transwestern and northern natural gas pipelines , the bank said .
enron ' s problems aren ' t industry problems , felsinger tells cnbc
2001 - 11 - 29 16 : 33 ( new york )
san diego , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s problems are
particular to the company and should not reflect on the energy
industry , sempra energy group president donald felsinger said in
an interview with financial news network cnbc .
` ` i ' ve really been surprised and impressed in how well the
energy industry has responded with enron ' s problems , ' ' he said .
` ` the past month the energy players have stepped up and taken over
positions that enron had , and the energy market today is working
very well . ' '
felsinger said $ 15 million in business with enron isn ' t
` ` material ' ' and will not affect sempra energy ' s earnings this
year or next year .
california ' s senator dunn comments on possible enron bankruptcy
2001 - 11 - 29 17 : 03 ( new york )
sacramento , california , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - california
state senator joseph dunn , chairman of a committee investigating
possible price manipulation in the state ' s wholesale power market ,
comments on how an enron corp . bankruptcy would affect the probe :
` ` if we assume enron files for bankruptcy , either through
liquidation or reorganization , our ability to deal with the
corporate entity to get documents and access to witnesses will be
overseen by a bankruptcy court , which means we have to jump
through additional hoops and ladders to get the information we may
require .
` ` substantively , it doesn ' t affect our investigation at all
because the senate ' s investigation is not out to get anybody . we
are tying to get a very thorough understanding of why we got into
the mess we are in and whether any concrete legislative fixes in
the wholesale market need to be taken .
` ` enron was a critical player in setting up the market that
ultimately gave rise to the market power , which in my view is the
ultimate cause of the energy crisis .
` ` there are some pluses and there are some minuses if we
assume that enron disappeared from the energy trading market . it
would create a void that would have to be filled by other players
in the wholesale market .
` ` if those other players that fill that void do not currently
posses market power , that ' s a good thing because the diffusion of
market share , most economists will tell you , is one of the best
ways to eliminate already existing market power .
` ` if enron goes into reorganization bankruptcy rather than
liquidation , and they are purchased by one of the big players that
currently possesses market power , then we are only going to
complicate the crisis that we currently find ourselves in . ' '

cibc says it is owed $ 215 million by cash - strapped trader enron
toronto , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - canadian imperial bank of
commerce , the country ' s third - biggest bank , said enron corp . owes
it $ 215 million , more than half in unsecured loans , letters of

31 from c $ 1 . 1 billion ( $ 695 . 8 million ) last year
toronto - based cibc said it ' s owed about $ 115 million in
unsecured items and $ 100 million in secured loans by enron .
houston - based enron , once the biggest energy trader , may face
bankruptcy after dynegy inc . withdrew a bid for the

` intelligent asset ' author bernstein comments on 401 ( k ) plans
2001 - 11 - 29 17 : 23 ( new york )
north bend , oregon , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - william j .
bernstein , author of the investment book ` ` the intelligent asset
allocator , ' ' comments on the disadvantages of corporate pension
plans that hold company stock and place the responsibility and
risk of managing retirement savings with employees . his comments
follow the collapse of enron corp . , whose 401 ( k ) plan held 62
percent of assets in the energy trader ' s common and convertible
preferred stock at the end of 2000 and restricted employees '
ability to sell .
as of the end of 2000 , about $ 1 . 8 trillion was invested in
401 ( k ) plans serving 42 million u . s . workers , according to cerulli
associates . investors in 401 ( k ) plans lost money last year for the
first time since they were introduced in 1981 as stocks fell .
` ` maybe some good will come of ' ' enron ' s collapse in the way
of national pension reform , said bernstein . ` ` it ' s never , ever
prudent to put your company stock in your retirement plan . the
overwhelming majority of plans allow it and a large plurality of
them encourage it . a fairly significant minority of plans have
very large amounts of company stock . you want to diversify your
risks . if your company fails , at least you have a backstop . ' '
bernstein said individual investors ought to consider putting
their retirement savings into a combination of low - cost mutual
funds that track indexes for u . s . stocks and bonds and
international stocks . ` ` the average person has as much business
managing their own retirement as they do taking out their own
appendix , ' ' said bernstein , a neurologist by profession .
in addition , average 401 ( k ) plan expenses of 3 . 5 percent of
assets exceed the projected annual returns of 3 percent from
stocks in coming years after adjusting for inflation , meaning
investors are facing zero long - term real gains , bernstein said .
expenses are lower with traditional corporate pension plans ,
known as defined benefit plans because they guarantee a certain
level of retirement benefits based on pay and years of service .
` ` the way defined contribution plans are currently set up
there is not adequate controls on expenses . what you ' re really
getting is an enormous transfer of wealth from plan participants
to the financial services industry . this is an enormous social
experiment that ' s been foisted upon us and it ' s going to be a
failure , ' ' said bernstein .

enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy ( update 3 )

enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy ( update 3 )
( adds investor comment in eighth paragraph . )
washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to
file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy
inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled
with more than $ 15 billion in debt .
enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week ,
must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is
responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated
partnerships . the company ' s credit - rating was downgraded to junk
status yesterday .
houston - based enron ' s collapse was underscored by new
restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange
barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without
special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading
was reduced from about 30 commodities to just natural gas ,
electricity and metals .
a bankruptcy filing by enron , which investors said may come
within a matter of days , would top texaco inc . ' s record $ 35 . 9
billion case in 1987 . creditors would be lining up to claim what ' s
left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets .
` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of
deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron .
` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things
out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' '
duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and
a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion
combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas
companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of
yesterday .
european administrator
in london , was appointed administrator
of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating
companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter
11 papers in the u . s .
` ` if i were a betting man , enron going into chapter 11 in the
next week is a bet i ' d make , ' ' said glen hilton , who helps manage
$ 125 million , including dynegy shares , for montgomery asset
management .
enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value
in the last seven weeks . they fell 25 cents , or 41 percent , to 36
cents . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 .
enron bonds were bid at 23 cents on the dollar in late
trading , little changed from yesterday , traders said . the debt had
been near full value as recently as last month .
quarterly dividend
the company said this morning it was evaluating whether it
will pay a scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 .
enron hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which has
the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone group
lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of restructuring
at blackstone , said his firm was retained and declined to comment
further .
chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the
company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a
provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt -
collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the
company .
` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved
company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean
of the university of houston law center .
thousands affected
an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people ,
including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers ,
suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised
recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies
and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in
the company ' s liquidation .
in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a
nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns
portland general electric , which generates and distributes power
to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s
enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic
communications network .
chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous
contracts and unprofitable leases .
` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away
from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also
publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations .
recovery
the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a
company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan
typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing
two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a
bankruptcy judge for final approval .
the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various
classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy
code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their
claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as
bondholders and suppliers .
financial advisers to creditors and companies in large
bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be
particularly difficult to produce .
` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass
of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a
bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard &
zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for
advice by enron bondholders .
shareholders
enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their
investment in chapter 11 because they would be last in line to get
paid .
some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may
come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker
with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for
advice by enron bondholders .
` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky .
potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers
and directors . ` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization
is going to be a painstaking job . ' '
liability
dynegy might face some liability for cancelling its purchase
of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave
it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the
takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in
exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco
corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy .
enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking
away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline .
the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was
proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5
billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the
lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s
decision .
bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b .
lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors
turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be
able to pay its debts .
unraveling
enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said
shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the
way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the
announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s .
securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating
earnings for almost five years .
as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence
the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners
such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or
restricted trading with the company .
` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s
going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up
being an unsecured creditor tomorrow . ' '"

0,"on friday , the assembly failed to get its version of the edison mou out of the appropriations committee .
the bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full assembly for passage .
negotiations continue among assembly democrats about what the final bill should look like .
the assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the assembly on tuesday .
in response to the california puc proposed order , which would retroactively end direct access on july 1 , the assembly amended its bill on friday to include its own "" date certain "" for the temporary suspension of direct access .
the assembly bill would now suspend direct access beginning august 25 .
we are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1 ) the date the bill is signed or 2 ) september 1 .
we will provide additional information on tuesday about the bill ' s status and our progress in changing the suspension date .

subject : california update - - 08 . 31 . 01
the assembly will attempt to pass its version of the edison mou ( sb 78 ) out of the appropriations committee today .
if and when that occurs , the assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full assembly today .
it will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today .
if and when the assembly gets the bill out of the assembly today , the bill will move over to the senate , where the chances of passage are even more remote .
that said , davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature .
will report back with the events of the assembly .
don ' t hesitate to call if you have any questions ( 415 . 782 . 7822 ) .

0,should we ever have wondered why it is so hard to get rid of the misunderstanding that compulsory licensing can only be used under limited circumstances this is what jon pender of gsk is quoted as saying he should know better jon pender of glaxosmithkline a british drugs giant insists that compulsory licensing was meant to be used only ³as a last resort² he argues that although compulsory licensing is legal trips rules allow it only under limited circumstances such as national health emergencies and only after lengthy efforts to negotiate prices with firms pharmaceuticals a gathering storm jun escapenumberth escapenumber new york from the economist print edition reuters drugs companies' patents are under attack will this really help the poor get article background nobody could fault thailand for want of ambition at the recent bio conference the largest annual gathering of the biotechnology industry it pitched itself hard as an emerging pharmaceutical power with a dazzling pavilion visiting luminaries and free drinks for all instead the arguments with thailand are over means not ends at the end of last year the thai government stunned the drugs industry when it said it would overrule international patents for efavirenz an anti retroviral drug made by merck an american firm and switch to a thai made generic copy at half the price the country had signed the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips which protects drugs patents but that deal allows ³compulsory licensing² only under special conditionsconditions that some complained thailand did not fulfil in the months since then thailand has said it would overrule the patents on two more drugs and it may soon add a further pair to the list moreover other countries have followed its lead brazil declared last month that merck was charging too much for efavirenz in recent weeks the health ministers of india malaysia and kenya have also muttered about pursuing compulsory licensing all this has sparked an almighty row many global health advocatesincluding bill clinton whose foundation works on hivhave applauded the trend arguing that access to cheap generic drugs will greatly help the poor last month the world health organisation passed a resolution supporting compulsory licensing america objected vociferously but other rich countries supported the motion drug executives are furious jon pender of glaxosmithkline a british drugs giant insists that compulsory licensing was meant to be used only ³as a last resort² he argues that although compulsory licensing is legal trips rules allow it only under limited circumstances such as national health emergencies and only after lengthy efforts to negotiate prices with firms ³it is easy to see big pharma as a source of evil ² laments daniel vasella chairman of novartis a swiss drugs giant his firm is involved in a closely watched patent case in india that involves gleevec a cancer drug without innovation he insists future generations will have fewer life saving drugs³which is equally unethical as lack of access now ² and as fred hassan the boss of america's schering plough and head of the international pharmaceutical lobby warns ³without intellectual property there is no innovation ² at first sight this row reflects an old dilemma that pits today's patients against tomorrow's compulsory licensing means that more thais will get hiv drugs now but it also means that drugs firms will be less keen to invest in drugs for thailand in the future yet look closer and this is more than a fight between the poor country sick and rich world drugs companies what makes it different is the role of two new actors muscular middle income countries and the rising generics industry this controversy has been sparked not by the poorest countries which already get most of their drugs at low cost but by middle income ones they have long used the threat of compulsory licensing to win discounts but by actually imposing such licensing they shift the balance of power rudolf van puymbroeck a former senior lawyer at the world bank likens compulsory licensing to other sorts of compulsory state purchases ³firms are upset not because this is illegal but because they are in a very weak position to negotiate compensation after expropriation ² follow the money a perverse result of this trend is that middle income countries are getting cheaper drugs whereas quieter and perhaps more deserving neighbours are not thailand's poor no doubt need treatment but the military regime is wealthy enough to spend more on health care richard epstein of the university of chicago law school has observed that there is nothing to stop aids organisations or foreign governments from buying these products at a negotiated price and then giving them away free ³charity can come from anywhere not just drug companies ² he notes even experts devoted to the cause of helping the poor get access to drugs see the trend as worrying ³brazil is not rwanda which cannot afford to pay ² says tadataka yamada of the gates foundation a giant charity victoria hale head of oneworld health an innovative non profit pharmaceutical firm reckons that compulsory licensing could prove ³the last blow² that pushes the drug industry away from looking for cures for diseases of the poor world which are already woefully neglected whether or not the poor end up suffering in the long run from diminished innovation a sure winner from the trend towards compulsory licensing is the generic drugs industry under a provision of the trips treaty countries that invoke compulsory licensing but lack domestic manufacturing are allowed to import generic drugs from another country this promises a gold rush for generics firms canada encourages domestic firms to produce copycat drugs for precisely this reason but their costs are so high that such exports cannot hope to compete with the cheaper pills produced by india argues amir attaran of the university of ottawa small wonder that executives at cipla one of the indian firms already making generic versions of hiv drugs warmly applaud the trend and welcome brazil's support for compulsory licensing which they say ³helps protect the rights of citizens² does the future therefore belong to compulsory licensing if so there may be trouble ahead for both pillmakers and punters dr yamada fears that compulsory licensing could prove ³lethal² for the industry he suggests that drugs firms and middle income countries ought instead to use a sliding scale based on gdp per head to determine prices bruce lehman a lawyer who worked on the trips accord in the clinton administration thinks it is cynical for middle income countries ³to avoid paying their fair share of drug discovery costs² in doing so he fears they risk provoking a backlash from americans who will in effect have to pay more as a result but things may not get that ugly thanks to the growing influence of innovators in developing countries themselves even in india drugs patents have their defenders ranbaxy is a local firm that made its name by manufacturing knock off drugs but ask ramesh adige a member of its board about the current trend and he is quick with his reply ³we do not encourage compulsory licensing ² he explains that his firm has escapenumber escapenumber researchers and invests escapenumber of its turnover in research and development it already has process patents and within two years hopes to have patents for novel drugs for malaria possibly ³we are very supportive of intellectual property rights as innovations must be given their reward ² he says the reason ranbaxy has gone from ignoring patents to defending them is that it now has inventions of its own that it wishes to protect even yongyuth yuthavong thailand's science and technology minister seems to acknowledge the risk his country is taking ³as a scientist myself i know the value of intellectual property ² he says ³in future we should develop our own drugs industry ² ip health mailing list ip health lists essential org http lists essential org mailman listinfo ip health

0,"thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments
arrive too late . here they are anyway :
1 socrates
i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have
primary responsibility for this system / project .
but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this
project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in
history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart .
2 exhaustive ?
it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such .
3 symptoms or causes ?
many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will
likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is
applied .
in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 :
"" prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality . . . ""
because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation
errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think
about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move
on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they
did .
i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on
microsoft excel all day , everyday .
4 overall
i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking
off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate .
as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality ?

allegheny is no bid on new albany . they want to focus only on technology which allows for combine cycle conversion . the turbines at new albany do not accommodate combine cycle conversion .
they are interested in pursuing our longview development in washington , and we are going to follow up with them on a couple of sites in entergy .

0,"kathryn has done a good job of keeping me in the loop on this . in addition , kim has consistently provided useful , objective feedback , as shown in the memo attached below .
we will produce a stable code with the changes kim and her team have requested before the package is released outside the building .
i have also asked kathryn to perform more testing within the cl team before asking kim and her team ( or any other clients ) to play with the changes . performing significant changes overnight , and then showing the code to clients the next morning is wonderfully responsive , but a little too risky .
the high - level demo scheduled for thursday will show code that is already frozen and hardened .

subject : update on confirmlogic
i wanted to give you a quick update on confirmlogic . . . .
testing was done last week on the confirmlogic module . on thursday , we discussed with kathryn cordes and the confirmlogic it team the items that we had found that were "" show stoppers "" as far as releasing the product for beta testing . some of the major items found were the inability to properly handle basis swaps for gas and inability to display meaningful index references for power ( they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the index ) .
the team worked on the "" fixes "" and migrated the code last night . today during testing , they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information , which was working previously . i talked to kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code . she said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine . we plan more testing in the morning .
they are doing a high - level demo this thursday for beta customers just to introduce the module . they were planning on having more extensive beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further .
we have told them that we would not sign off for beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working . we need consistent , stable days of testing before i will feel comfortable .
overall , we like the "" new "" streamlined version of the screens and feel that it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues .
call with any questions .

subject : re : heartland industrial partners
with respect to your questions concerning the heartland industrial partners fund and current investments :
heartland is a private equity buyout fund with $ 1 . 2 billion in commitments . the targeted size of the fund is $ 2 billion . the fund is headed by david stockman , former managing director at the blackstone group . stockman was director of omb under reagan .
heartland ' s objective is an irr of 30 % gross ( 26 % to the limited partners ) . the limiteds get an 8 % preferred return after which the gp gets a 20 % carried return . the gp also receives a 1 . 5 % management fee . in my experience these terms are consistent with most private equity funds .
the fund ' s objective is to acquire and expand industrial companies "" in sectors ripe for consolidation and growth . "" these "" industrial platform scaleups "" are targeted to be in sectors such as aerospace components and materials , automotive suppliers , capital goods , chemicals , plastics conversion , metal working , etc .
the fund has two investments currently :
mascotech is a merger of three fund companies . it is a leading global designer and supplier of high quality , low - cost metal formed components , assemblies and modules for the transportation industry . products include noise vibration and harshness products , transmission and transfer case components , engine components , wheel end and suspension components , axle driveline components . estimated revenues were $ 1 . 9 billion in 2001 . the company has 50 facilities in 11 countries . 9 , 500 employees .
an agreement to purchase collins & aikman corporation was signed in january 2001 . c & a is a leader in automotive floor and acoustic ceilings and a leading supplier of automotive fabric , interior trim and convertible top systems with 2000 sales of $ 1 . 9 billion .

subject : re : heartland industrial partners
dave ,
congrats on your new role . heartland industrial partners was an investment pursued solely for the purpose of providing deal flow for energy outsourcing opportunities when ena ' s industrial group was following a broad based energy outsourcing business plan . it has zero relevance to eim ' s business . in fact , heartland has been reflected on ena ' s balance sheet ever since the creation of eim last august . brad dunn has administered the relationship as a transitional matter in the intervening months . brad has attempted to get ees to take on the transaction , but they have expressed no interest in the capital commitment . however , ees wants the option to look at the energy outsourcing opportunities in the transaction . if i thought i could get a free option , i would take the same position . if enron is to get anything out of heartland industrial partners beyond the return on our invested dollars , that value will come to ees . since there is no paper or steel aspect to heartland , it doesn ' t belong in eim and i don ' t want it . i would be happy to discuss .
on a different note , there are lots of opportunities for ees and eim to work together on ( i ) energy opportunities in eim ' s pulp colwell , wes ; raymond bowen / hou / ect @ enron
subject : heartland industrial partners
richard , it is my understanding that this investment is currently in ray bowen ' s business . in my ena shoes , i would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility . in my ees shoes , i would like to take a closer look at the possible connections . please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio .
i have also heard that tom white has been talking to you about ees taking on the catalytica investment . with my ees shoes on , no way ! ! ! !
regards
delainey

subject : heartland industrial partners
dave , in may 2000 enron north america committed to invest up to $ 30 million in heartland industrial partners l . p . , a private equity fund . the terms of the fund investment are fairly typical ( and not particularly exciting for a limited partner such as we ) . the deal was "" sold "" on the basis of ena getting exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies owned by the fund if these were cost effective . the claimed benefits for the energy management tie were calculated at $ 20 - 50 million . the deal was originated by brad dunn who now is in eim . ownership of this commitment had been assigned to jim ajello .
the kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now provided by ees . while they are happy to exploit any opportunity , their business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this kind of deal . in short , they have no interest in picking up the commitment ( and capital employed ) via an intercompany transfer .
private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the normal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years . the heartland partnership has a 10 - year life , enron did negotiate the right to sell its lp interest after 3 years . as a practical matter , that right guarantees neither a fair price or even a market .
there is no logical home for this investment that i know of in ena except in my portfolio . question : is this an ena responsibility or would it move to eim ' s balance sheet ? if we ( ena ) have no choice but to retain the investment , my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to monetize funds invested to - date ( about $ 6 million ) and sell the remaining commitment . since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership interests , however , it will be extremely difficult to get out of our investment / commitment in the foreseeable future . under any circumstances finding a buyer will be time - consuming and expensive . ( this is a poster child for "" patient "" investment capital ) .
i want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is that the obligation should be transferred to eim which i believe has assumed the charter of the ena group that formerly managed this investment . dick .

first the good then the bad and then what's next good bob when bob zoellick was appointed george w bush's choice for united states trade representative ustr public health groups like ours were concerned would zoellick retain ustr's very new policy announced by president clinton on december escapenumber escapenumber at the chaotic seattle wto ministerial to consider the impact of trade policy and medical patents on public health in developing countries or as many expected would he reverse policy and turn ustr back over to big pharma and use the agency as a club to push for tougher rules on patents and other intellectual property protections on medicines zoellick surprised most people by announcing he would retain the newer public health friendly approach and also persuaded george w bush to keep intact executive order escapenumber which president clinton had issued a year earlier may escapenumber escapenumber prohibiting federal employees from seeking trips plus intellectual property protections in sub saharan africa when it interfered with access to treatments for aids but this was not all bill clinton had actually filed a wto case against brazil in january escapenumber days before he left office over brazil's efforts to use compulsory licensing of patents to promote local production of aids drugs the case was very controversial and the subject to criticism by activists and the subject of tina rosenberg's influential new york times account of aids treatment in brazil zoellick dropped the case after a secret deal with brazil to consult with the u s before issuing such licenses escapenumber in november escapenumber resisting enormous pressure from pharmaceutical ceos zoellick signed on to the historic and much praised doha declaration on trips and public health among other things this declaration declared we agree that the trips agreement does not and should not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health accordingly while reiterating our commitment to the trips agreement we affirm that the agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of wto members' right to protect public health and in particular to promote access to medicines for all in this connection we reaffirm the right of wto members to use to the full the provisions in the trips agreement which provide flexibility for this purpose bad bob big pharma was shaken by zoellick's first year as ustr by early escapenumber things had changed with regular meetings with rove and josh bolten the pharma companies we able to closely dictate ustr policy on a number of issues by the end of escapenumber ustr was receiving in some cases hourly phone calls from the white house on negotiations over how to implement the escapenumber agreement the results were not pretty but from our perspective it seemed as though the problem was the white house and in particular rove and bolten and not zoellick in any event zoellick devised a new and highly effective way to push higher ipr rules for developing countries they were put into bilateral agreements where the poor countries had almost now power to resist zoellick the technocrat was worse than many ideologies in terms of the impact in this case competence was not a good thing zoellick then moved on and the next two ustr chiefs were increasingly worst than zoellick on these issues all of this pushed poor countries in ways that make a mockery of the promises the u s made in escapenumber at doha what's next the world bank is supposed to be an advocate for the poor under wolfowitz as under his predecessor the bank took in pharmaceutical industry personnel to deal with sensitive procurement and pharmaceutical policy issues with almost no conflict of interest protections but wolfowitz did not completely prevent the world bank from doing the right thing the record was mixed zoellick comes at a time when the world bank is being asked to represent the poor in debates over the role of intellectual property protection and development he doesn't like big pharma but he has been a team player on many occasions so it will be interesting to see what he does with his new job with his benefactor leaving office january escapenumber i hope we see good bob and not bad bob footnote escapenumber brazil has never used this provision in its patent law this year brazil

can offer a day rate , regardless of the number of people . ?
?

enron location makes more sense . no reason to pay for the hotel .
also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training

will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the

is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the

mscf program at carnegie mellon . the time you spent talking to us about
enron , and the energy industry in general , was very much appreciated . in

are now interested because of the things about which you spoke . i have
signed up for an interview for the associate program at enron , and i hope to
speak to you again through involvement in the associate program . thanks

back in october we had the gas received by hpl at the above meter moved to
strangers gas pending a call from coastal to renegotiate a contract for sept
2000 gas . since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger  , s gas it has
been placed on an mjg deal which was the only valid deal available for sept
2000 .
i assume coastal has not contacted brian as of yet . is it possible to have a
deal created for coastal with a price of zero ? i know that we definitely do
not want to pay mjg for this gas , but as long as the volume is sitting on
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the
payment out . let me know what you think .
thanks ,

having discussed the matter with brian riley , hpl has no intention of
contacting coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received
in september at at meter 4179 . it was brian ' s opinion that the gas should be
considered strangers gas since hpl has no contract or price . it is
suggested that nick moshou contact his counterpart at coastal , relaying this
information and suggesting coastal ' s trader contract brian riley .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

last week , i orchestrated some changes within my operations organization which will free up more of my time to focus on the successful commercialization of mid and back office services . i have asked bob hall to lead operations for enron americas , with peggy hedstrom ( calgary operations ) , jeff gossett ( gas risk and south america operations ) , stacey white ( power risk ) and leslie reeves ( confirmations and settlements ) reporting directly to him . he is enthusiastic about the additional responsibility and i believe that he will do an excellent job for enron americas .
other changes include appointing kevin sweeney as head of operations for eim , with brenda herod reassigned as part of a project team that will work on the ees assimilation . i have also asked beth apollo to play a project management lead role in the assimilation of ees into ews .
i will be glad to fill you in on more details on any of these changes . the result is to give more responsibility to several key players - stretching them , but i will be there to support and coach them in their new roles if needed . plus , i can now devote significantly more time to the commercialization effort . in that regard , i did move to the 27 th floor ( next to piper ) while you were out on leave .
i wanted to share these changes with you before a memo goes out across the organization next monday . call me if you would like to discuss . - - sally"

0,"since i had to leave before the meeting concluded and you were not there at
that point , i wanted to recap my understanding of the next steps . ed
gottlob , melissa graves , rita wynne and clem cernosek will work together to
pull data to view hplc ' s total transport business , and then balance it to the
off - system interconnect business used in the texas trading operation . this
perspective , when all elements are accounted for and tied out , should result
in the accounting ua 4 numbers recorded each month in our general ledger .
they will focus as the core team , and will enlist others as needed which
might include gas accounting , settlements ( lisa csikos ) or others .
additionally , johnnie has offered assistance from her team , but feels the
project of tieing the data best resides in energy operations . they will need
to determine their course of action , and schedule a follow - up meeting with
the group when they have some data to share .
i want to reiterate : we all understand the importance of this project and
will do everything possible to support it . these 4 people will remove
themselves from their daily activities to concentrate on this full - time . we
felt a dedicated group would deliver the desired results more effectively
rather than individuals balancing other responsiblities . it is crucial that
everyone take ownership in the results .

0,"i completely agree with you .
nevertheless , i am sorry if i did not make myself clear when we talked about
this last tuesday : i am not advocating penalizing business units because of
their lweek rovars or sharpes . i would certainly not set traders ' bonuses
based on these numbers ( nor do i think anyone at enron would consider doing
that ) .
enron focuses on long term profit and risk . however , the long term is made
up of many short terms , and catastrophes can occur if a company ' s management
does not pay close attention to the latter . indeed , enron management is very
interested in short term profitability ( they want to be notified of very
large 1 and 5 day losses ) and short term risk ( we report daily var limit
violations ) . in this spirit , i am simply offering 1 and 4 week rovars and
sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the
dpr database , and i will let upper management use or ignore them as they see
fit .

subject : risk metrics
eugenio ,
in regard to your recent e - mail concerning rovar , sharpe and other
risk metrics , and our meeting on tuesday , it is imperative to understand that
( 1 ) while p & l is a number one can aggregate on a daily basis , var numbers on
1 - week or 4 - week basis , and consequently rovar numbers , are not meaningful
operationally ( ie , trading activity and senior management decision - making )
and statistically . rovar and sharpe were designed to measure business unit
performance over extended time periods ( preferably a year ) . specifically ,
you cannot penalize , or make reasonable business decisions about a unit ,
because of their 1 - week rovar or sharpe .
( 2 ) significant trading activity at ene is composed of long - term strategic
trades ( seasonal plays with durations of over 6 months , perhaps ) , wherein
desk heads and senior management have an intuitive feeling for their rovar
( over 6 months ) . a 1 - week or 4 - week "" interim "" number in this case is not
useful . traders might purposefully want to make a certain 1 - week or 4 - week
rovar low in their trading activity if they believe their 6 - month number can
be high . in such a case , a 1 - week number might send dangerous messages to
senior management .
( 3 ) conceptually , p & l and var , in isolation , are numbers which are sound and
rigourously calculated . the ratio , however , one has to be careful about .
the numerator ( cumulative p & l over a certain period ) can be aggregated by
simple arithmetic summation , no problems . however , the denominator ( average
daily var over a certain period ) relies on the underlying assumption that
each point in your time series is independent and correlationless . to get a
sufficient statistic for the denominator , one would have to take a large
sample in your series ( 6 months or more ) , for a daily average var number to
be meaningful , statistically .
( 4 ) the rac group has instituted similar metrics which have been in usage
for over two years . the numbers are shown to the b . o . d with the express
intent of comaring business unit performance on a 6 - month or yearly tenor .
please contact matthew adams ( rac ) or myself to make sure that we are on the
same footing regarding the actual calculation of such metrics . also , in the
future , just to be consistent and on - the - same - page , please contact me or mr .
adams if any risk - related numbers are to be showcased in a public forum .
( 5 ) finally , as you can probably corroborate , senior management might not
be fully versed on the nuances of var , let alone 1 - week var ratios .
therefore , one has to be wary of the misuse of ratios and risk metrics .
i liked your presentation of your database on tuesday . i think it is a nice
step in aggregating and dissecting p & l from disparate sources .
best regards
naveen"

that is great news . we are still pressing the lawyers to see if the enron rep letter can be signed today or in the near future . that way we can issue under the wlb committed lc line .
hopefully once the bank meeting concludes on friday , some of these guys may be more amenable to us using some of the uncommitted lc capacity we have unused at this time .

all ,
barclays has agreed to accept cash collateral on an ongoing basis until such time we are able to post an l / c subject to the provisions stated below .
under the circumstances , i think that they have been very flexible and would be unlikely to negotiate on most of the points . we would need some clarification on point 1 ( onerous if it applies to all contracts under the current isda ) , we would expect 1 . to only apply to so 2 transactions ( written into the so 2 confirm ) .
vincent , brent , i would be grateful if you would take at a look at these points . our timeline is to get everything signed by lpm today .
