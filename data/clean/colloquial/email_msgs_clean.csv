questar can ' t sell from proposed pipeline under new ca rate
although not giving up its search for customers in california , salt lake city - based questar corp . ' s oil - to - natural - gas converted pipeline from the four corners of new mexico remains stymied in operating its portion within california under a newly revised "" peaking tariff "" for southern california gas co . , according to questar officials who have been analyzing the new rate established aug . 2 by state regulators . questar is looking at alternative uses for the california portion of the approved interstate pipeline .
"" we can ' t work with ( the rate ) as it is , "" said chad jones , a questar spokesperson . "" it definitely doesn ' t go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in southern california . it still doesn ' t level the playing field . although it is better than the current rls ( residual load service ) tariff ; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a socalgas competitor .
"" customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state , and higher rates for balancing services . we ' re at the point where we ' re not going to stop trying to market capacity on southern trails , but we ' re definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the california portion ( of the 700 - miles , 16 - inch - diameter pipeline ) . ""
one of the alternatives would be to operate the california part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the long beach harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the california - arizona border . that ' s the alternative , however , jones said , but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline ' s 120 mmcf / d capacity is still questar ' s preference .
after months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives , the california public utilities commission last week established a new "" peaking "" or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a socalgas competitor , allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility , socalgas .
the cpuc tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers , while trying to "" encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry - picking or overbuilding , "" according to cpuc president loretta lynch .
questar officials said tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources , and they are "" not about to go head - to - head with the established big boys "" in lobbying california ' s governor or state legislature , jones said . "" thus , we ' re still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in southern california in the name of promoting competition . ""
the east - of - california portion of the southern trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid - year next year , jones said ."

0,"thank you , first of all , for supporting us in our decision to
reschedule the summit . the following letter has been sent to all
participants . though we ' ve been in touch with you by phone , we would
greatly appreciate your reconfirming , as soon as you can , for our
march event , as follows . . . .
to : fortune most powerful women in business summit
participants
from : pattie sellers
date : september 19 , 2001
re : postponement of summit
my fortune colleagues join me in hoping that you and your loved ones
are safe during this time of tragedy .
in the aftermath of last week ' s horrific events , we have decided to
postpone the upcoming fortune most powerful women in business summit
scheduled for october 3 - 5 in pasadena . the new dates and location are
march 6 - 8 , 2002 , at la quinta resort & club in palm springs ,
california .
while certainly much could have been gained from bringing together
this remarkable group of leaders at this time , it ' s clear that our
participants need to stay close to their homes and businesses .
already , the march program promises to be every bit as strong as the
october summit . almost all of our speakers have confirmed that
they can join us at la quinta march 6 - 8 . carly fiorina , jack welch ,
oprah winfrey , andrea jung , shelly lazarus , pat russo , sherry
lansing , gerry laybourne , jamie gorelick , lisa caputo , betsy bernard ,
lynn forester , louise kitchen , ann richards , stacey snider , ginger
graham , nancy peretsman , anna catalano , marie wilson , peggy brill ,
and anna deavere smith have all locked in the new dates . . . and we
hope you will too .
kindly let us know as soon as possible whether you can be with us next
march by contacting suzanne o ' leary at 212 - 522 - 9444 or
suzanne _ o ' leary @ timeinc . com . suzanne can arrange a full refund of your
registration fee if you cannot join us at la quinta . if you have
already made reservations at the ritz - carlton huntington hotel & spa
in pasadena , we will take care of canceling your room reservation for
next month .
like you , we were anticipating an outstanding summit next month . but
we hope you agree with our decision to postpone it . we look forward to
coming together in strength on march 6 - 8 to forge new and lasting
relationships and to explore how extraordinary women rise to meet the
challenges of extraordinary times ."

could you take a look at what i ' ve put together ? conceivably , this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we ( or i ) could maintain , which would include a wscc map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information . i talked to cara about setting up an intranet site , as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that , and she said she was working on setting something up with fundamentals and volume management . that ' s a whole different subject - maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment . at any rate , this is a rough draft , but i thought i ' d show it to you to make sure i ' m heading in the right direction .

the time granted the wilcoxon still requires the assumption of symmetry i'm curious as to why the wilcoxon is often used when asymmetry is suspected since the wilcoxon assumes symmetry but that's less

informative unless you assume the variable is normally distributed however clinicians often insist that i included these figures in reports cody hamilton phd edwards lifesciences well said cody just

examine the power of the tests for n escapenumber you'll probably find it's not good enough to reach a reliable conclusion and wouldn't it be even worse if i used non parametric tests i believe what frank meant was that it's probably better to use a distribution free procedure to do the real test of interest if there is one instead of testing for normality and then use a test that assumes normality i guess the question is what exactly do you want to do with the outcome of the normality tests if those are going to be used as basis for deciding which test s to do next then i concur with frank's reservation generally speaking i do not find goodness of fit for distributions very useful mostly for the reason that failure to reject the null is no evidence in favor of the null it's

0,"transwestern denies withheld capacity to boost negotiated deals
a transwestern pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for california from its recourse - rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates .
mary kay miller , vice president of rates and certificates , acknowledged transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes ( prior to posting its available capacity ) with two shippers - - sempra energy and richardson products ii ltd . - - that subsequently entered into negotiated - rate transactions . but she stressed that requests for capacity by sempra energy and richardson were considered "" moot "" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted .
"" even if they would have sent . . . a fax the day before "" capacity became available , "" it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted "" at that time , said miller . capacity requests that came in prior to jan . 31 , the day that available capacity was posted for february contracts on transwestern , were "" null and void . "" the only "" relevant "" ones were those that transwestern received on or after jan . 31 , she noted .
miller spent much of wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for ferc and producers about transwestern ' s methods for notifying customers about available capacity , the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre - posting contacts with sempra energy and richardson .
it was the first day of a ferc hearing exploring charges that transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated - rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $ 27 / mmbtu last february , far in excess of the pipeline ' s maximum allowed rate of 38 cents / mmbtu for firm transportation service to the california border . the commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated - rate contracts of sempra energy and richardson for a total 45 , 000 mmbtu / d of service on transwestern during february and march .
richardson and sempra "" clearly did not have any ' deal ' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted , "" miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony . the two companies "" had the right to the capacity only ' after ' they submitted their bids , ' after ' the posting period ended , ' after ' transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted , and ' after ' a contract was agreed upon between transwestern , richardson or sempra , "" she noted .
despite claims made by ferc energy industry analyst barry e . sullivan to the contrary , "" transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates , "" miller testified .
sullivan , an analyst in the ferc office of markets , tariffs and rates ' ( omtr ) division of litigation , contends that transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates . in fact , he believes the pre - posting discussions between transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate , so that shippers might be more "" willing to enter into negotiated - rate contracts above the recourse rate , in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [ it became ] available . "" but miller counters that sullivan "" offers not support for his claim . ""
she noted that even sempra energy and richardson , in response to a data request by southern california edison , support transwestern ' s claims . both companies replied "" no "" when asked whether "" any employee of transwestern or any transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate . ""
the "" capacity at issue was offered on transwestern ' s web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on transwestern ' s web site at the recourse rate ; there was no prohibition , restrictions , limitation , condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate ; and any potential shipper , including richardson or sempra , could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate . ""
sullivan contends that transwestern ' s motive for allegedly advancing negotiated - rate transactions at the expense of recourse - rate deals was pure profit . under questioning by thomas j . burgess of ferc ' s omtr , miller conceded that transwestern earned $ 1 . 8 million from sempra energy ' s contract in march , $ 1 . 3 million from richardson ' s march contract , and a "" comparable "" amount from richardson ' s february contract . she noted the pipeline received a "" substantially higher "" amount as a result of sempra ' s february contract , but she didn ' t provide an exact figure . ferc ' s sullivan estimated the pipeline ' s profit from the sempra february contract was more than $ 5 million .
sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in transwestern ' s coffers would have gone to sempra energy and richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates . but miller countered that the commission ' s negotiated - rate policy "" does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits . ""
furthermore , she said the transwestern case shouldn ' t be used to consider changes to the negotiated - rate policy , as sullivan has suggested . this case "" is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated - rate policy should only be done on an industry - wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged .

0,it looks like the idea of moving listener involvement further back on the music development timeline is gaining steam you're trying it with strayform amie street is doing something along those lines and marillion has also been trying it with their recent releases all the while the bands bypass the middlemen by default pooling the listeners' money together to build their own cash advances the difference being that a well established act like marillion can go it alone while newer and smaller bands would need the support of some sort of aggregator like strayform very clever it'll be interesting to see how the various licensing schemes being employed by each will contribute to their individual success dream dream wrote i am the founder of a new company strayform the goal of the site is provide an alternative means for musicians programmers movie producers and authors to fund publicize and distribute their works i would like to get feedback on the concept and the site itself  the philosophy  historically publishing companies provided many useful services for creative producers they provided equipment and facilities funded artists developed worldwide distribution channels and publicized and advertised on artists ¡ç behalf but as time went on the industry became bloated and corrupt artists have been forced into restrictive contracts lost control of the copyrights and given small cuts of the revenue consumers have been forced to pay exorbitant prices and suffer drm and nasty lawsuits but the industry has undergone massive change in the internet age the functions of the media industry are being taken over by consumers and artists themselves the price of equipment has dropped so that individuals can now create professional quality productions independently fans now use blogs messengers and e mail to spread the word about what they like there is no longer a need to ship cds books or dvds as file sharing services offers a costless distribution method the only missing piece now is ¡èfunding¡é while file sharing is great the result of unchecked piracy will leave artists with no way to make money and therefore no incentive to produce new media it is time for the funding model to evolve historically bundled into the cost of each cd or book is the cost of production and distribution but now with the internet distribution is nearly costless let ¡çs move the payment forward to the point of creation recording companies pay artists upfront to create something new and then charge the consumers per copy let ¡çs have fans pay the artists directly and give them the freedom to use and share they will use this freedom to distribute and promote providing a valuable service to artists the end result would be lower total costs more freedom and control for artists and consumers and new communities with strong ties between artists and fans  the site  with actualizing this vision in mind i created www strayform com it works like a social network for artist and fans with specialized features to promote fund and distribute new media a library of cc licensed media leads to you to discover new artists becoming fans of these artists and selecting media as one of your favorites allows us to rank and provide recommendations while giving you specialized privileges and notifications people with similar interests surfing your pages use these connections and find new favorites and artists as well these massive connectivity provides a network that funnels interest into proposals proposals are artists ¡ç offers to create new cc licensed media funded by fans the more proposals that are completed the large the library grows for artists the more of their media circulating the more fans they gather the more fans an artist has the more money he can make on each successive proposal the greater the incentive to create new works as the ecosystem grows we have a new system for funding promotion and distribution built by fans and artists we are a very small company but have created an expansive system based on this concept we have just launched and would like feedback on how to improve our system and would like to get the word out about strayform so please try our site out and give me your feedback i am member ¡èstray brandt ¡é we are new and small so i am sure we have a lot of room for improvement but please join us and help us reach this vision brandt cannici founder www strayform com easy joy powerful yahoo bookmarks x toolbar http pr mail yahoo co jp toolbar cc community mailing list cc community lists ibiblio org http lists ibiblio org mailman listinfo cc community cc community mailing list cc community lists ibiblio org http lists ibiblio org mailman listinfo cc community

regard to ees :
global counterparty -
priority # 1 counterparties ( ees counterparties that have $ 100 , 000 or more
ar or ap exposure ) - 506
counterparties entered in gcp 506 - 100 % complete
these priority # 1 cp ' s were completed in 55 days .
priority # 2 counterparties ( ees counterparties that have $ 75 , 000 or more ar
or ap exposure ) - 703
counterparties entered in gcp to date - 35 - 5 % complete
all priority # 2 cp ' s will be completed within 45 days ( march 23 , 2001 ) .
ees has approximately 14 , 000 counterparties to be entered into the gcp
database . we have been dealing with ees ' karin williams and scott mills on
the gcp set up .
we have quoted ees a rate of $ 20 . 00 per counterparty entered into the gcp
database . we currently have 4 people working full time on the research ,
calling and entering of ees ' s cp ' s . beginning in january 2002 , we anticipate
utilizing a mutually agreed upon monthly fee .
jason moore and i are the designated global contacts for ees in regard to gcp .
global contracts and global facilities -
in a february 16 th meeting with wanda curry , scott mills , mark evans , and
other ees personnel , ees indicated that they were leaning towards utilizing
the global contracts database . we briefly discussed the global facilities
database , but we all have agreed to concentrate on the feasibility of the
contracts database first and leave the facilities implementation question for
a later date .
as a result of the above mentioned meeting , we have an ees demo set up for
tomorrow morning from 9 a . m . - 12 p . m . in order to give ees personnel a
"" hands on "" demonstration of the functionality of global contracts . a
portion of ees ' s contracts include multiple commodities and staggering
agreement terms that global contracts is now unable to capture . therefore ,
we will need to institute numerous system enhancements , with the co - operation
of global it , in order to process ees ' contracts . the timing and it manpower
needs of these system enhancements will be discussed at our demo by global it
personnel .
if ees does agree to utilize global contracts and facilities we will need to
set up a separate ees maintenance group within global .
ees has informed us that they would like to do all of their contracts data
input . therefore , we anticipate the use of 3 global contracts personnel for
the training of ees ' personnel . two global employees would be assigned to
work directly with ees ' s personnel on a daily basis . the remaining global
contracts person would act as a "" help desk "" here on 37 to answer any global
contracts questions .
in regard to billing ees for the global contracts database assistance , we are
proposing the use of a "" flat rate "" monthly fee structure , similar to the one
utilized for bridgeline gas pipeline . we would also include a "" start up ""
fee to cover the cost of the initial it system enhancements .
donna consemiu and i will be the designated global contacts for ees in regard
to global contracts and facilities ."
0,that dialog based installer system is dangerous because it's so easy to make a mistake one wrong keystroke and there is no going back so if you accidentally press enter on any of the sections you're stuck with whatever was selected in that section this one part of slackware that should have been fixed using different tools long ago but i guess patrick figures its not broken so don't fix it i was thinking all of the content that goes into those dialog screens are stored in files so it should be possible to read those files and generate an alternate install method it would be nice to have a script that makes a file containing all of the install choices similar to the kernel config and another script that does the entire install with one command then you could also have a default install config and possibly even launch that automatically from a special boot disk i may consider working on something like that some day but i have too many other things i'd like to tackle first spie speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

el paso natural gas this week received approval to begin the internal cleaning of its line 2000 , which would convert the former all american oil pipeline to gas service . the internal cleaning , or "" pigging , "" will begin at the la paz pump station , and when this portion of the conversion is completed , the project will add about 230 mmcf / d of new capacity by aug . 31 .
el paso bought the line from plains all american pipeline l . p . in early 2000 . it extends 1 , 088 miles from emidio , ca , to mccamey , tx . the purchase also included any fiber optic rights that all american had along its entire 1 , 233 - mile system .
el paso was awarded a federal energy regulatory commission certificate to begin the conversion project in may , and then began a binding open season for additional capacity , which extends through aug . 2 . the open season is for 230 mmcf / d of capacity from the keystone and waha areas of the permian basin in west texas to the california border near ehrenberg , az . the expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to line 2000 from mccamey to ehrenberg , with a projected in - service date of mid - 2003 ."

thanks for the email . i have talked with sally several times on this last
couple of days and i understand that ou has a different recruiting schedule
then other schools . enron is on campus for recruiting in the near future and
i have asked sally to tag on some interviews for summer interns while on that
trip . i believe that she has been able to schedule this so i believe that
from an ou perspective it may be a mute point now . doing that should be able
to maintain the momentum that we have developed at ou and all the work lexi
has done . by the way , the recruiting trip a couple of weeks ago was very
successful .
if you have any other questions or comments please let me know .

subject : re : hiring practices for summer interns
sally ,
thanks for the e - mail regarding summer interns . i apologize that lexi and
shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking . i wish
that you had contacted either celeste or me to indicate that you were having
difficulty . i have personally assured you on several occasions that i was
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any
member of my staff was not responsive . that being said please allow me to
explain the recruiting strategy since i was instrumental in helping to set it .
you are absolutely correct . it is great to do market research if time
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge . as
you are aware , over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting
firm ( brecker & merryman ) who has assisted us in a number of different market
research projects . however , in my opinion , this issue is not one that
required much research . i have been involved in recruiting in some way ,
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10
years . most major organizations , with the exception of the accounting firms ,
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring . there are
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns
until after a certain date , particularly in the mba programs . for example ,
harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first
year students until january . as indicated , the firms that generally recruit
in the fall are the accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for
"" spring "" internships .
the recruiting strategy at enron is no different this year than it was last
year with respect to summer interns . presentations were made in january however , because lexi has other school interviews that are
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview
process during the trip you have scheduled currently . as you are aware , in
most instances , the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by
the respective universities and were secured in early august . if you would
like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this
fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to
support your efforts .
i hope this has been helpful . i can understand and appreciate your
frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her
manager . again , i offer that i am available and willing to work with you if
you are having difficulty with members of the program staff .
please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer
interns and whether i can be of any additional assistance .

0,"mark golden is an excellent reporter covering the power scene .
our takeaways :
* power prices are declining in california as the "" destruction of demand ""
effect of higher retail power prices kicks in .
* the long - term power contracts signed by the various power producers and
energy merchants are looking like sweetheart deals for them , as evidence of
price weakness ( from a base of extremely high prices ) is beginning to
develop .
* the movement in prices in california is reflective of the message in our
power curve 4 report , where we show that forward prices are peaking this
summer . year / year power price comparisons are now projected to be flat
4 q : 01 , and declining afterwards .

power points : great news ! long - term contracts jeopardized
by mark golden
a dow jones newswires column
new york ( dow jones ) - - those looking for even the slightest bit of good
news
for the state of california can find it in friday ' s san jose mercury news .
"" california is in danger of losing more than 40 % of the power it has lined
up in
long - term contracts , "" says the lead of a major article , because republicans
in
the state legislature didn ' t back the $ 12 . 5 billion bond deal last week .
getting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen
to
california in a long time .
since the state went on its long - term buying binge , forward prices for
power
in the western u . s . have been falling steadily . gov . gray davis announced
$ 43
billion in purchases lasting up to 20 years on march 5 . contracts for summer
power at palo verde , ariz . , a key western trading hub that feeds a lot of
power
into california , have fallen to $ 390 a megawatt - hour from a high of $ 600 / mwh
in
late march . further out , power for 2004 - 2006 at mid - columbia river , a key
trading hub north of california , has fallen from $ 58 / mwh in february to
$ 49 / mwh
today .
companies like calpine corp . ( cpn ) and dynegy ( dyn ) that took advantage of
the
state ' s buying binge are looking pretty fat and happy . in fact , they have
affectionately started calling the governor gravy days . enron corp . ( ene ) ,
which
has been selling aggressively for two months , according to traders , is
looking
like a genius as usual . generators that held out , like reliant energy ( rei )
and
duke energy ( duk ) , may be sorry that they did .
it ' s been a long time since those long on western power have felt serious
pain
in the markets , but that time has come . power generators may not make as
much
profit this summer as last , and power traders that have taken long
speculative
positions may liquidate supplies for far less than they bought them . as was
seen
in the eastern u . s . power markets last summer , long positions can turn out
just
as painful as short positions .
for california , the good news is that maybe spot purchasing costs this
summer
won ' t be as bad as once expected . the bad news is that the state government
is
by far the biggest "" long "" in the bearish forward market . it ' s safe to say
that
the $ 43 billion in contracts signed in march have declined in value by 15 % ,
or
$ 6 . 5 billion . that ' s almost as big of a financial disaster going forward as
everything that has gone on since last summer until now .
granted , this is a sort of damned - if - you - do - damned - if - you - don ' t situation .
barring the utilities from the forward market during the first three years
of
deregulation was one of the most expensive public policy mistakes in u . s .
history . california should do some forward purchasing now , and it ' s such a
behemoth that it will move the market up when it does so . and , when it gets
done
buying , prices will come down simply because it stopped .
but that ' s a footnote to the mismanagement of the financial side of the
energy
crisis . early this year , when the state started down the path of
mega - purchasing , there was no shortage of advice not to do so . long - term
prices
were embedded with too much of today ' s supply - demand imbalance . the state
would
have been much better off dealing with the imbalance first - since it would
have
to do that anyway - and gradually securing forward power as declining prices
reflected the improving situation .
since then , the state has done a great job of crushing demand . electric
usage
is already down 9 % from where it was expected to be thanks to a conservation
efforts and a slowing economy , and people haven ' t even seen their 30 % higher
bills yet . similar reduction has been seen in power consumption in other
western
states and in natural gas usage nationally . this is likely what has been
behind
much of the downturn in forward power prices in the west .
this column started with a false "" good news "" lead . it would be great for
the
state if , after the state ' s credit rating sinks further , sellers exercised
their
option to tear up the five - and ten - year contracts . but they won ' t do that .
the
prices are too good from the sellers ' perspective . calpine , which has signed
three such contracts for the state , said immediately that it has no
intention of
reneging on its agreements . and gary ackerman , director of the sellers '
association , told the mercury news that he didn ' t expect power companies in
general to back out of the deals .
but there may be some real good news for california . the davis
administration
hired dozens of people that have little or no experience in energy trading
to
purchase billions of dollars of power . perhaps they are quick learners . this
week presented an excellent opportunity for the state to pick up what it
needs -
summer power for this year only - on sale . low prices in the daily market
monday
and tuesday drove the summer contract prices down to $ 325 / mwh , which is
cheap by
recent standards . the contract price moved up to $ 390 / mwh , but the state
took
advantage of the opportunity while the window was open .
"" the week ' s condition in the market place helped . we were able to procure
some
energy for june through september , "" said state spokesman oscar hidalgo .
and , hey , there were no blackouts this week .

the attached dash is not final , but may circulate later today . mark haedicke has the legal risk memo - the attorney ( karen jones ) characterizes the risk as very low ( our information and knowledge reps are qualified and capped at 10 % ) . we are hoping to sign as early as today or monday , but funding may not occur until after sep 30 ( we will push hard to get funds in this quarter ) . regardless of cash timing , income recognition of approx $ 1 mm can be accounted for in q 3 as planned .

ok . i know that !
i wasn ' t planning to "" promote "" all the managers to director however . just retitle them , leave their salaries as is . if we want to give them all bumps to $ 115 ( from $ 95 ) , then i ' ll start water dropping that .
i was assuming you wanted 2 or 3 new md ' s , 5 or 10 new vp ' s and probably 50 or 60 other incidental changes on the support side between specialists and snr directors ( presuming we don ' t do away with titles for support folks ) .

0,"executive summary :
- cpuc likely to pass rate hikes tomorrow , politicians bowing to the inevitable
- many questions still unanswered , most notably size / structure of rate increase and past utility debts
- past undercollect major sticking point , with little help available from transmission deal or long - term contracts
- reliant seeking relief in circuit court from emergency orders ; large generators increasingly angry with davis ' "" blame game ""
- qfs waiting for details of rate hike ; new price formula crucial to socal ' s ability to make payments
- bankruptcy outlook increasingly complex , but debt rescheduling remains subject to failure
in our late friday report , we wrote "" davis could order rate hikes as a last ditch effort , but this action would not address the undercollection issue . there is still a high chance of bankruptcy by either the larger generators , commercial paper holders , and ( less now but still very possible ) the qfs as time is running out . "" events are unfolding exactly along these lines .
1 . why rate hikes now ?
cpuc president lorretta lynch came out this weekend in favor of rate hikes . davis and many legislators recognize that rate hikes are the quickest solution , but that there is a potentially painful political price attached . davis will probably come out in support of a structured rate system , passing on most of the hikes to business and industrial users .
other california politicians are starting to face reality of rate hikes . the calenergy ruling massively reduced their leverage over the creditors , who are now able to sell outside the state , if they can get similar relief from the courts . and it ' s not just the qfs - - the giant reliant energy is appealing to the ninth circuit court in san francisco against federal judge frank damrell ' s series of rulings forcing large generators to continue to sell to california .
2 . what impact will the rate hikes have ?
rate rises will stabilize the situation going forward , but there will be a messy scramble to assign blame and liability for past debts . some form of rescheduling is a possibility , but there are any number of accidents that could happen and yet result in bankruptcy for the utilities - - if they don ' t seek protection from creditors themselves .
3 . undercollection / net short still unaddressed
all of these developments fail to address the past undercollection or the bond revenue plan . still , the passage of rate hikes could speed up the legislature on these fronts as well . the bulk of the rate hikes will go first to repay the dwr , then to the commercial creditors . absent the transmission line deal , the bond revenue plan would have to be restructured to repay the past undercollect . long - term power contracts are still relatively meaningless until 2003 , when the majority of the contracts kick in .
4 . large power suppliers losing patience
relations are also deteriorating between davis and the large power suppliers . davis for the most part has been very careful to cultivate them during the drawn out negotiations , talking to several of the main ceos almost daily . but state legislators and officials are rapidly trying to initiate investigations of alleged market manipulation and overcharging to deflect the growing political heat from themselves . this is only agitating the larger generators more as every day passes . if reliant loses their case , it may also tempt some of the larger generators to force the issue to bankruptcy . what ' s more , financial creditors are also waiting with growing impatience , and the utilities themselves are contemplating voluntary bankruptcy . pg and ( 2 ) many of them have to move in court quickly or lose any possible standing for future court action . it is in the interests of a number of creditors to wait and hope that a negotiated settlement can be reached , but others have a large incentive to game the situation and threaten to force bankruptcy .
other bullish news : pg & e gets extended forbearance until april 13 th from its banks , and socal announces that it will pay some qfs . the actual amount of payments to the qfs is still subject to the cpuc approving a revised pricing formula that is satisfactory to the qfs . that decision should come tomorrow .
6 . outlook
last week we wrote that "" the qfs felt there was no point in filing today because they want to see what they can get from the legislature this week and in all likelihood , what they can get from the cpuc hearing next week . "" the next 48 hours will be crucial . only massive rate hikes ( 40 % or higher roughly ) would address the undercollect issue and davis is unlikely to authorize those .
as one source told us , "" the age of denial is ( mostly ) coming to an end , and that is the main source of hope that california can begin to move forward from this . "" but the situation is so complex , and there are so many players and angles involved , that a negotiated solution to the past debt problem will still be complicated and vulnerable to failure ."

0,i don't know of any sources but the idea is quite simple for each constraint that is broken the penalty is the amount by which the constraint is broken times a penalty rate the total penalty to add to the objective is the sum of penalties over all constraints there is a catch or two when using this with derivative based optimizers the objective typically becomes non differentiable at the boundary and optimizers can get confused they might be less confused with smaller penalty rates however if the penalty rate is too small then you can get a solution that breaks one or more penalties starting from a solution given by rgenoud or its ilk is probably a good idea patrick burns patrick burns stat com escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber http www burns stat com home of s poetry and a guide for the unwilling s user paul smith wrote dear all i am dealing at the moment with optimization problems with nonlinear constraints regenoud is quite apt to solve that kind of problems but the precision of the optimal values for the parameters is sometimes far from what i need optim seems to be more precise but it can only accept box constrained optimization problems i read in the list archives that optim can also be used with nonlinear constrains through penalizations however i am not familiar with the technique of penalizations could someone please indicate to me a site or a book to learn about that penalization technique thanks in advance paul r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code

jeff ,
we are reviewing the p + spread option book . one item of note is that the
correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from
what was being used a year ago ( see charts below ) . i also remember that
john mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book . in fact
he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1 . 0 , but our model would not
allow it , so he was using 0 . 999 .
we are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well . if
you want , vince and i can review this with you at the end of the day . just
let me know what time would be convenient .

john :
we still do not have a deal with the government . they have delayed giving us a written proposal over the last two weeks . the latest is that they have said that they will give us something on tuesday of next week .
with respect to the burn rate , we are projecting about $ 20 million in expenditures over the next month . our current investment is about $ 220 million .
i think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months . the investment is currently funded through an off - balance sheet / on - credit vehicle with westlb . the westlb vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations . the plan is to have the opic financing in place to take out the westlb vehicle . this would infer an approximate $ 95 million equity investment upon the take - out of the westlb vehicle . we are currently in the process of syndicating the equity . we have one indicative proposal for 50 % of the equity . we hope to have another next week .
there are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of . westlb did not want to take operating risk in the financing . our position with westlb is that we do not reach commercial operations until we reach the start date of the petrobras contract . we are currently producing energy into the grid . at some point , westlb could try to force us to take out the entire vehicle prior to the opic funding . depending upon the timing , this could represent a cash flow of up to $ 280 million for a short period of time .
please let me know what other questions you have .

it looks like we will be making our bammel true - up payment to aep in the next couple of days . included in the payment to aep is a deduction for the sale of the centana storage gas . we are selling them 1 , 236 , 286 mmbtu @ $ 2 . 375 for a total of $ 2 , 936 , 179 . 25 . the sale is for september , 2001 production . we will need a deal put in sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics . however , there is only 1 , 195 , 754 mmbtu on report 006 in unify ( for contracts 96018371 , 96014189 , and 96019236 ) . how do we account for this volumetic difference ? connie will be truing up the gl to match the current unify volume . the gl was short approx . 18 , 000 mmbtu because a beginning balance was not booked .
this needs to happen before the upcoming close .
thanks for you help in this matter .

subject : extreme value theory applied to weather
dear vince ,
back in july , when you visited our sydney office you mentioned extreme value
theory . i am wondering whether research is looking into the application
of extreme value theory to power and esp . to weather . in a recent news
article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t _ max , t _ min ,
etc .
i am in particular referring to the news article below :
in the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for
t _ max , t _ min , or below or above precipitation structures . the choice in the
past has been the burn analysis on historical data . however , we are in
particular interested in the extreme events , and the application of evt could
provide a meaningful tool for the analysis .
has the research group looked into the application of evt to weather ? evt has
a long history of application in hydrology ( which would cover parts
of the precipitation structures . . . ) . also , research ( esp . at eth in zuerich )
is indicating the application of evt to v @ r . . . .
thank you !
regards ,
christian"

0,"this raises some interesting questions around a global support model .
i had a concern that we are throwing a global metals business into a regional
support control process in london . indeed , i am asking myself what support
model should exist for asia - supposedly the key growth area for the new
enron global markets business .
would you have time to discuss / brainstorm this - or do we think we have time
to prepare ( my worrry is that there are senior executives planning global
expansion which the support model ( houston and london ) can not cope with )
or am i paranoid

0,june escapenumber escapenumber salem massachusetts by timothy lutts too many lawyers bang bang zap zap long ago i read an article that reported on the correlation between a country's economic growth rate and the percentage of lawyers in that country the conclusion a country with too few lawyers lacks the legal structure that enables open markets and the flow of capital to wherever it's treated best contrarily a country with too many lawyers finds itself bogged down by excessive lawmaking and red tape somewhere in the middle the author argued was an optimum level of course economics is an exceedingly complex business and there are numerous factors that are even more important than the number of lawyers but a fair amount of evidence suggests that the u s now has more lawyers than it needs for example two thirds of the world's lawyers are now found in the u s and law schools continue to produce some escapenumber escapenumber more every year because supply exceeds demand not all of them end up in the legal profession and no doubt that's a good thing but enough of them get there to cause trouble like the fellow who's suing his dry cleaner for escapenumber million over the loss of a pair of pants that he tarnishes both his profession and his own reputation in the process is a given anyone with half a brain can see that escapenumber million is a ridiculously inappropriate number yet the plaintiff carries on confident that the potential reward outweighs the certain costs of time money and loss of reputation and proving in the process the old saw that the lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client i wonder what his mother thinks sticking to lawyers assuming that most politicians are lawyers and begging your indulgence i'll descend for a spell into the morass of national politics where poll numbers and a good haircut matter more than ideas and honesty normally i steer clear of politics in these letters i know you're reading this for investment ideas they're coming and i know from experience that some people can get touchy when it comes to political opinions but i can't resist commenting on this week's development in short new york city mayor michael bloomberg announced that he had dropped out of the republican party and is now unaffiliated with any party my response in the word of teddy roosevelt bully the only thing better would be to have hillary and mitt and barack and rudy do the same so we can have a chance to learn what they as true individuals really think and not what they think their respective parties want to hear and i know i'm not alone after all between escapenumber and escapenumber of voters nationally belong to neither the republican nor the democratic party in alaska the percentage is escapenumber in new jersey escapenumber and in massachusetts escapenumber these people are sick of the two party system in which each party's biggest priority is self perpetuation they want politicians who can work together to do the right thing in solving our country's problems they want less influence by lobbyists and special interest groups and more attention paid to what's right for the country as a whole and given the right candidate they'll vote for him or her now technically bloomberg is not running for president but that's part of the game given his fortune legally earned by serving the needs of investors he can afford to delay an official entry into the race and if he does declare i wish him luck i appreciate a man or woman who can break from the party ranks to stand alone for ideas that he or she believes in i like lieberman for breaking free from the democrats in connecticut i like schwarzenegger for daring to be a different kind of republican in california and hey i even appreciate that old socialist from vermont bernie sanders just because he's neither a democrat nor a republican so now on to guns where i have both a traditional and a space age investment idea of course guns like politics tend to incite passions but this section's not about my opinions it's about the stocks themselves i learned long ago that the market is always right and because the stocks of both these companies are going up i think they're both worth writing about and perhaps investing in on the traditional side there's smith wesson holding corp swhc which traces its roots back to escapenumber smith wesson in fact is the escapenumber maker of handguns in the u s its manufacturing facilities are in springfield massachusetts and houlton maine in escapenumber the company was bought by tomkins plc a british conglomerate for escapenumber million and things went okay for while then in escapenumber the company signed an agreement with the clinton administration in order to avoid lawsuits saying it would add safety features to all its products but the resulting boycotts from gun clubs and gun rights groups so damaged sales that the company was sold a year later to saf t hammer run by a former smith wesson executive who had previously left tomkins for just escapenumber million from today's perspective that was a huge bargain the market has now accepted the safety features in smith wesson guns and today six years later the company is valued by the market at escapenumber million credit good management for the turnaround smith wesson has introduced new models of handguns to the market targeted to both the law enforcement and sporting markets no longer restricting itself to revolvers it's branched out into pistols and with them it's fast winning new law enforcement contracts it's increased its use of plastics thus lowering both weight and cost it's revamped its sporting goods sales force so that it's comprised entirely of employees instead of manufacturers' representatives and it's partnered with companies like walther to co manufacture handguns and now it's getting into the long gun business in january smith wesson spent escapenumber million to buy thomson center arms a new hampshire manufacturer of hunting rifles and black powder muzzleloaders and it's introduced its own line of shotguns in short it's using the venerable smith wesson name and the cash from its ipo to grow through both diversification and acquisition more acquisitions are likely but perhaps the biggest growth could come from the u s government smith wesson's new pistols have won the company four orders from the department of defense in recent years some are for firearms in afghanistan but there's been nothing big yet orders from the federal government account for just escapenumber million per quarter looking ahead though there's hope that the government will replace its escapenumber millimeter pistols with more powerful sidearms like smith wesson's new escapenumber caliber pistol if so that would really light a fire under the stock not that it's doing badly now smith and wesson swhc has earned a spot in cabot top ten report five times in the past ten months most recently in april and readers who bought on any one of those recommendations and held on are happy today as the stock is hitting new highs if you choose to buy try to do so during a corrections advertisement our next escapenumber stocks could put you on easy street even when the market is weak there are always some stocks going up and the best way to find them and to learn why they're so strong is to read cabot top ten report which every monday shoots an email to your inbox detailing the fundamental and technical facts behind the ten strongest stocks in the market mike's momentum based stock picking system has no biases it doesn't dislike commodities or chip sectors or housing stocks if a stock is leading the market upward mike cintolo will sniff it out to learn more visit the link below http cabotmail net t escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber my other gun story the space age one is about taser tasr a taser an acronym of thomas a swift electric rifle is technically not a gun it doesn't shoot projectiles it shoots darts that remain attached to the hand held taser by small wires that then deliver pulses of electricity to the target effectively incapacitating him it's almost always a him by disrupting neuromuscular function back in escapenumber escapenumber the cabot market letter's model portfolio owned taser and rode it to a profit of escapenumber why did we sell because the stock turned down and why did the stock turn down because of growing fears by both investors and police departments the main buyers of tasers of the growing number of lawsuits against the company the fears by police departments led to shrinking revenues and the fears by investors led to a tumbling stock price top to bottom taser lost escapenumber of its value but the bottom did come police departments did resume ordering tasers are now in use or in tests by escapenumber escapenumber law enforcement agencies in the u s and canada and the company recently completed its escapenumberth successful defense against a wrongful death or injury lawsuit in fact the company has never lost a product liability lawsuit the conclusion as we believed years ago is that tasers are safe more important they reduce injuries and deaths of both law enforcement officers and suspects and that leads to a raft of benefits for all parties taser actually makes models for both professionals and consumers the professional models use wires that are escapenumber feet long while the consumer model uses wires that are just escapenumber feet long in a shoot out involving a professional and consumer the professional wins there's growing interest from international customers last week the company announced that a foreign international law enforcement agency had ordered escapenumber escapenumber units and there's talk that the new law and order president of france nicolas sarkozy would like to arm all of france's escapenumber escapenumber police officers with tasers finally coming on july escapenumber is the official introduction of the company's long awaited extended range electronic projectile xrep expelled from a escapenumber gauge shotgun the new product will dispense with wires and use microprocessor controlled intelligent electrode selection technologies in a self contained projectile the company is keeping a tight lid on the details until then but we know it has been tested by the u s military at ranges up to escapenumber meters furthermore mr stephen kunich representing the air force air combat command security forces volunteered for a five second exposure after the exposure mr kunich commented the effect locked up muscles and totally overwhelmed the senses i was completely incapacitated additionally i was amazed at the instantaneous physical recovery there isn't much doubt of full compliance after exposure to a taser weapon like xrep there's investment risk of course at escapenumber this is still a fairly low priced stock and that means volatility is a given furthermore the stock has gained escapenumber in the past two months so a correction that gives some of that back would not be unusual but long term we expect the move to non lethal weapons to continue to grow we like the fact that this is a global business we like the company's patents and the fact that they're the leader in the industry and because the company has penetrated roughly escapenumber of the domestic law enforcement market and less than escapenumber of the worldwide market there's clearly terrific growth potential if you're attracted to it as an investment i suggest that you buy carefully ideally on a pullback and that you be careful to keep losses small editor's note the cabot market letter recommended taser this week but didn't add it to its portfolio yet the model portfolio is already loaded with stocks and it's up escapenumber year to date but in the future anything could happen to stay abreast of all the cabot market letter's top

energy exchange program neutrality adjustment
charge type 1487
sc settlement contacts :
background
as you may know , the energy exchange program began on trade
date 11 / 14 / 2000 . in this program the iso obtained needed energy in for the
real time market and , rather that paying for the energy as a purchase , later
returned the energy in another period . this was not necessarily a
one - for - one exchange . the incoming energy created a positive neutrality
adjustment and when the energy was returned , a negative neutrality
adjustment ensued . since the incoming and outgoing energy were usually
valued differently , there was a cost shift associated with the transaction
that was not cash neutral to the iso . the iso created charge type 1487 was
developed for the allocation of the cost to scs participating in the market
during the incoming schedules
notification
the iso has created charge type 1487 so that whenever an
energy exchange account is closed or reaches a zero balance , the incurred
costs will be calculated and allocated to the sc ' s based on their total
negative uninstructed energy over those intervals in which the incoming
schedules took place . this new charge type will appear beginning on the
june 30 , 2001 statements which will be published on august 23 , 2001 . in
addition a few accounts reached a zero balance as early as december , 2000
and therefore allocations may or may not appear on your statement with the
rerun data .
ct 1487 is a semi automated charge , meaning that the
collection of energy data is automated , but it will be a manual charge type
within the manual line item records and will not require a change to your
settlement system . note that this charge will not appear on every
statement , but only when an energy exchange account is closed or reaches a
zero balance .
if you have any questions , please contact your client
relations account manager .

? ? ? i have put together a list of finance working papers ( some of which i
brought to the interview last wednesday ) which i have written since 1995
mostly in support of my work but also ( at least initially ) as a learning
tool . several of them , however , ? do contain innovations .

spawn .
?
? ? ? i also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in
the secondary mortgage maket in the us . i do not know if enron has
considered or is active in this market . this would be an area that i am also
very interested and in which i think much better can be done than most of
the players in the street .
?
? ? ? the question in my mind ( hopefully not prematurely ) ? is : if there is
interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business ?

maac executive board files restructuring agreement
september 27 , 2000
norristown , pa :
the mid - atlantic area council ( maac ) , one of the ten regional reliability
councils of the north american electric reliability councils ( nerc ) , filed a
new
agreement on september 22 regarding the governance of maac with the federal
energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) . maac ' s basic purpose is to ensure the
reliability of the interconnected bulk power system in the region . maac ' s
area
of responsibility covers the same geographical region as the control area
operated by the pjm independent system operator ( pjm iso ) , consisting of all
or
parts of the states of pennsylvania , new jersey , maryland , delaware ,
virginia ,
and the district of columbia . the maac restructuring process began years ago
and
is expected , with ferc approval , to be implemented on january 1 , 2001 .
"" we are excited to be positioning the maac organization to address the needs
of
the new competitive era , thanks to the interest and participation of the
stakeholders for over two years . "" stated pete landrieu , maac executive board
chair .
phillip g . harris , regional manager of maac , commented "" the relationship
between
reliability and markets will be enhanced and strengthened by the maac
restructuring . we are also pleased to be making this change as effectively as
possible through the use of existing pjm organizational and other resources . ""
under the filed agreement , a new maac members committee is chartered with the
creation of the approval process of the maac reliability principles and
standards . other new maac committees are chartered , most notably , a maac
energy
market committee to serve as a forum for the discussion of the impact of
reliability on the commercial market place , and the marketplace on
reliability .
the agreement also provides for stakeholder representation on the maac board .
appropriate amendments to existing pjm agreements will be discussed with the
pjm
members and filed with the ferc .
the mid - atlantic area council was established in december 1967 to augment the
reliability of the bulk electric supply systems of its members through
coordinated planning of generation and transmission facilities . the maac
region
encompasses nearly 50 , 000 square miles from virginia to new york and from the
atlantic ocean to the great lakes . under the existing maac agreement and the
operating agreement of pjm interconnection , l . l . c . , maac and pjm members are
obligated to comply with maac and nerc operating and planning principles and
standards .

subject : update on srp margin call
importance : high
tim ,
as you know , srp made a margin call to epmi on monday , by letter , seeking $ 5 . 5 million in margin under a "" one - off "" contract . tracy and i sent a letter back on tuesday , arguing that the contract does not permit srp to call for additional margin unless ene is downgraded to junk status . srp responded to our letter this afternoon . predictably , srp disagrees with our view of the contract and demands its margin . srp says that it will treat our failure to post $ 5 . 5 million by monday , november 12 , in either cash or an irrevocable letter of credit , as an event of default and will terminate the contract . if this happens , epmi would have to make a payment of $ 5 . 5 million within 10 days of receipt of an invoice from srp .
as you know , tracy and i strongly believe that the contract does not support srp ' s right to call for margin at this time . however , the contract is not perfect ( they drafted it , after all ) and there is a sentence fragment that supports their position .
i recommend that we treat the srp - epmi dispute regarding the margining criteria under this agreement as a "" dispute "" under section 17 . disputes are first submitted to authorized representatives ( each company designates an authorized representative ) to resolve . if the authorized representatives cannot reach agreement within 30 days , then the dispute is forwarded to you and your equivalent at srp ( the "" executives "" ) . the executives have to meet within 30 days to resolve the issue . if the executives cannot resolve the issue within 30 days , then both parties can choose arbitration , or either party can take the matter to court . in summary , best case , this option gets us up to 90 days before we have to arbitrate / litigate the issue . otherwise , we better prepare to post collateral monday .
if you want to handle this matter by taking the "" dispute "" route , i should send a letter out tomorrow to srp giving notice that we wish to try to resolve this through the contract ' s "" dispute "" provisions .
steve
( i should also mention that tracy has informed me that srp plans to issue a margin call on our wspp contracts ( approximately $ 4 . 5 million ) as soon as it calculates the amount due . )"

subject : actions on anjam ' s resignation
all
my preferred approach to dealing with anjam ' s departure is given below .
these recommendations are informed by the fact that i don ' t feel anjam has
much to offer his next employer , except what code and data he can remove from
enron :
hr - type stuff :
1 . get anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible . there is no need for
him to remain on the floor .
2 . determine where anjam is heading . we need to know who is going to know
our positions and curves next .
it - type stuff :
1 . ask him to catalogue the contents of his h : drive , since the rest of the
group will need to support his work in the future . this should take no more
than a day or two .
2 . get it to obtain their backups of anjam ' s h : drive for weekly intervals
over the last two months . this will allow us to determine what he has
deleted .
3 . get it to provide a snapshot of anjam ' s notes folders , and provide records
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months . i ' m worried
about code / data he may have zipped up and mailed out .
4 . ask it to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from
anjam ' s c : drives . there may be useful info here too .

subject : netco
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements .
i would ask that both john and i are notified of any changes to the netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis . please forward all alterations to jeanie slone who has responsibility for the master list .
communication - i believe that the new year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on netco and what our policies are . i am asking david oxley to co - ordinate with all of you on this . i know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible .
if you are unavailable this week , please ensure you delegate this work out .
happy new year

today ' s focus : videoconferencing picture clears up
by neal weinberg
if you  , ve been turned off by the jumpy frames and poor audio quality
associated with real - time videoconferencing , the reviewmeister has good
news for you . there  , s a new generation of videoconferencing end - point
devices that provide business - quality pictures and sound for under
$ 12 , 000 .
we grabbed a box of popcorn and tested eight videoconferencing systems ,
using 384 k bit / sec isdn and ip connections .
in the category of videoconferencing appliances that is , standalone
systems that go in a conference room for group video sessions with
colleagues or business partners polycom  , s viewstation mp was the
clear winner .
the polycom viewstation provided outstanding video and audio quality .
in addition , it was easy to install , configure and use .
in the category of pc - based products , which are especially good for
virtual collaboration from your desktop , vcon  , s mc 800 was the hands -
down winner , based on its high - quality components .
the beauty of these products is they allow you to have a real - time
video image of the person you  , re conferencing with in one corner of
the screen , with the rest of the space available for data collaboration .
if you  , re in the market for a system , be sure to get one with a sony
evi d 30 / 31 video camera ; an unidirectional boundary microphone , like
the audio technica ; and a quality sound mixer . and look for remote
administration and system management tools . for example , the
viewstation allows you to upgrade software , change settings , or change
address book entries directly from the administrator  , s system .
most systems will allow you to transmit over isdn or ip , but we found
performance over ip was dragged down by ip  , s overhead requirements . for
the complete product review , go to :
of course , there  , s more to videoconferencing than end points , so we
whipped up an implementation guide that lays out the network topology ,
bandwidth and quality - of - service issues .
based on our testing , the reviewmeister says now is the time to start
pilot - testing a videoconferencing system . your chief information
officer will love it when you tell him you can slash your company  , s
airline and hotel bills because you  , ve got people from all over the
company in virtual rather than face - to - face meetings .
next week : we loaded windows 2000 on a pc and a server and ran gigabit
ethernet to the desktop . guess where the bottleneck was ?

sbl 8 xx - - - bill to de - link the bonds from the dwr contracts
in the only bipartisan move to date , sbl 8 xx passed out of two committees yesterday , but has not yet been voted on by the full senate .
the bill de - links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of dwr contracts .
the bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the dwr contracts .
the dwr contracts are being held up as the reason california must suspend , or end , direct access .
republicans on the assembly side are supportive of 18 , but hertzberg - - the speaker - - has joined with the governor ' s people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts , consititute a breach , and expose the state to substantial damages .
as a result , when the bill passes the senate and gets over to the assembly , its chances of passage there are low .
sb 72 xx - - - the senate ' s mou
the senate ' s version of the mou - - sb 72 xx - - limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full senate , but its chances of passing the full senate at this point are 50 - 50 .
the problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive edison into bankruptcy , while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out edison - - - - the courage and leadership is awesome .
in the assembly :
the assembly two versions of the mou - - - ab 82 xx and ab 83 xx ( now ab 50 xx )
the assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue .
the speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill ( 82 xx ) .
many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat ( rod wright ) , who has broken ranks with repbublicans , and assembly republicans .
in the end , the speaker ' s bill is likely to prevail .
things are complicated by the fact that the assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed .
as noted above , the assembly democractic leadership opposes sb 18 xx and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 18 ."

i submitted my evaluation . general impression was rather
negative : he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence but is short on depth
and technical details .
he is personable , outspoken , organized - on the positive
side .
also , the red flag is that he jumps from job to job : typical after
18 - 24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness .

hi vince ,
what did you think of david hsu ?
my thoughts .
overall a good guy . personable . intelligent .
he could communicate reasonably well , but seemed to be capable of losing
objectivity in favour of technical advancement .
he didn ' t seem comfortable with taking a man - management role ( at least he
didn ' t want to be an ' administrator ' )
he appeared to know a lot about risk . ( in fact jay web called me to say he
felt david was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull ) .
regards
steve"

i did not think of it , but without the pipe one has to balance ones own , doesn ' t one . of course the major problem was the people with hpl , not the counter - parties . who ' s doing that for you guys ?
jen came home for the memorial day weekend so we just bummed around . saw pearl harbor , watched a few dvd ' s , and ate way to much .
when you get time let us know about your "" bad luck "" . i hope jake wasn ' t helping you too much .
i have been occupying much to much time with our new sound system . we finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of yamaha stuff coupled to an equally large stack of klipsch speakers . awesome is the only word to apply . i ' m sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door . ( it ' s a young couple with a baby ) ( not near as nice as the other young couple i know ) .
rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good . : )
stock market still sucks , but as long as it pays for groceries and taxes we ' ll be ok .
i ' m off to get linda ' s gas guzzlin , environment ruining , suv washed and buffed . then i must re - stock my cd - r ' s and load up on some more music . you can see how well i ' m utilizing my time in doing productive things .

0,"please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all
get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance
committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week ,
and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in
accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this
may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to
come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and
mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our
joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved
in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the
best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod .
we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the
day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest .
as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that
the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups
defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with
that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) .
chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a "" rac "" dpr that
attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk
management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s
exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr
will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business
unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and
reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign
off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an
enron level .
the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first
quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr
available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of
3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to
attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high
level ) .
your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per
the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward ,
and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst
quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by
chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the
quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily
basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on
3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily
var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner -
especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to "" swag "" average daily
var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by
considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place
throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for
this cross commodity activity .
due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain
level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting
to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days ,
i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt
resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out
your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit .
when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact -
while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may
be material to global products , weather , etc . .
would you please help us with the following :
? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris '
staff can walk you through )
? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported
correctly ?
? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and
consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present
during the first quarter and material ? if so , estimate impact on p / l and
average daily var .
? we ' re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can
simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity
to get a feel , and if they point on specific material transactions , we can
address those ; you can determine best approach
? are there certain books in risktrac that have cross - commodity positions
imbedded / combined - either held currently or those that generated significant
var or p / l during the quarter ? going forward these will need to be reported
separately to facilitate risk reporting , but in the next week what we need is
an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities , or a conclusion
that the impact is immaterial .
? once you ' ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac
dpr and per your own knowledge , help us estimate the impact on the respective
commodities ' average daily var for the quarter - you can discuss with your
market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable "" swag "" approach .
after considering the information above , please provide your assessment on
whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross - commodity
activity , and if not , identify the issues involved and whether it is
something that market risk needs to address , or if it will simply take more
time to resolve the reporting details .
if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading
results for the quarter , please feel free to pursue those . i do not mean to
imply i know how to do your jobs , or that you ' re not doing them - i simply
want to coordinate with you to ensure the # s we report to the bod are the
numbers you agree with , and that if they ' re not completely accurate given
recent implementation , that we are able to articulate and estimate the
potential misstatement , if any . as you are the experts on your businesses '
results , i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm
understand regarding your reporting of the cross - commodity activity and
trading results and the application of the policy .
on a separate note , we need you to identify p / l related to special
transactions that flowed through the dpr , but do not really represent trading
activity - examples in the past are sfas 125 transactions and other unique
gain / loss events - we ' re reporting lq 2001 and lq 2000 , so whatever we can
recall about last year will also be considered . we will be sending you a
reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any
special adjustments , and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement
on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity . these
adjustments should be minimal , but we ' d like your input to conclude .
thank you for your cooperation ,
regards ,

( a ) for example , north american electricity limits represent enron ' s
consolidated na electricity trading activity , without regard to which
business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds
positions . so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons ,
these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p / l and combined with
gas ' var and p / l , etc . . heating oil positions held outside global products
should be aggregated with global products ; global products ' positions in gas
and power should be aggregated with gas and power , with corresponding
adjustment to global products ' results ."

available for the discussion .
i am working for joe gold and my group is concerned with adding the web as an
additional sales and communication channel for our european business units .
through the web we are also able to convey a more local image , rather than
presenting ourselves as a texan company through enron . com .
to set you into perspective about what we have in mind i have attached a
brief presentation which has been the basis for the sign off of the project .
we intend to display a wide training section for the following reasons :
document our know - how base
educate the market participants
generate great stickiness ( participants should know that if they need to know
s . th . on energy risk mgt . they should go to enron )
later on : have the option to commercialise this area .
i look forward to our discussion .

by peter eavis
senior columnist
08 / 30 / 2001 02 : 45 pm edt
url :
enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high - profile energy trading operation .
a billion - dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant ' s second - quarter profits , which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company ' s well - publicized trading acumen . a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second - quarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates . one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated . complicating matters , enron ' s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings .
for its part , enron flatly denies that it used one - time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired - assets sale was inflated . but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houston - based enron , which has long told investors that trading is its future . by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation ' s fast - growing energy market , enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years . operating earnings from trading surged 160 % in 2000 to $ 1 . 6 billion , causing the stock to double .
now there ' s chatter that enron ' s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter ' s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities . in addition , the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit . if asset sales can ' t be repeated and trading income weakens , earnings could crater , observers say , which could pull enron ' s already battered stock down even lower .
in fact , fear that enron ' s prodigious profits growth won ' t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year . other factors have contributed as well : investor dissatisfaction over enron ' s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year , and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job . skilling ' s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move .
enron chairman ken lay , who has now reassumed the ceo post , said this week that he aims to improve enron ' s disclosure . he has moved to allay concerns over top - level instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president , also vacated by skilling , and vice chairman .
but skeptics remain unconvinced . "" i think the second - quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales , "" says mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , a cambridge , mass . - based stock analysis firm that doesn ' t do underwriting . ( off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may . ) for the quarter , enron made 45 cents a share , 3 cents more than analysts had expected .

one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas - fired power plants to allegheny energy supply , a unit of allegheny energy ( aye : nyse - news - commentary ) , hagerstown , md . the deal took place in may for a price of $ 1 . 05 billion , according to allegheny ' s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures . ( allegheny declined to comment on the deal . )
enron ' s second - quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so - called peaker plants , says roberts . he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $ 500 million . an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $ 300 million . ( his firm hasn ' t done recent underwriting for enron . )
enron ' s financial statements don ' t specify the size of the gain from the peakers , so called because they supply power when demand is strong . the company declines to offer a number , saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold .
however , enron ' s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales - and - services line , which is by far the biggest contributor to enron ' s earnings , producing $ 762 million in operating profits in the second quarter .
the problem is that the firm ' s trading profits also are booked in this segment . as a result , investors can ' t know how much of the quarter ' s blowout commodity sales - and - services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading . if roberts ' $ 500 million estimate is correct , trading may have accounted for only $ 262 million in second - quarter operating profit .
partners indeed
the other deal that ' s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas - based assets that are used to produce mtbe ( methyl tertiary - butyl ether ) , the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently .
the assets were sold for $ 120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary , called eott energy partners ( eot : nyse - news - commentary ) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil . any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron ' s wholesale line .
the issues with the deal are plenty . it took place on june 30 , right at the end of the second quarter . this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results .
then there ' s the question of price . enron took a $ 440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999 , responding to what it described at the time as "" significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe . "" some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels .
skeptics ask : how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $ 120 million ?
in addition , an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they ' re worth $ 50 million at most ; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around $ 150 million .
put bluntly , did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations ?
an enron spokeswoman responds : "" eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business . it makes good business sense . ""
and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott ' s audit committee , made up of three directors who aren ' t employees or officers of any enron affiliate , as well as an investment bank , judged the sale price to be fair . however , the chairman of the audit committee , daniel whitty , is a director for two other enron subsidiaries . he declined to comment on the deal .
a person familiar with enron ' s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third - quarter numbers .
this person also says the gain was "" immaterial "" to enron ' s second - quarter numbers , since there wasn ' t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold . most important , this person insists , the $ 120 million price isn ' t based only on the assets sold . eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years ' worth of mtbe - related business . what ' s more , enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production , this person states .
whatever the case with the mtbe assets , enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay ' s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset - sale gains . "" they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is , "" concludes off wall street ' s roberts .
know any companies that the market may be misvaluing ? detox would like to hear about them . please send all feedback to peavis @ thestreet . com .
in keeping with tsc ' s editorial policy , peter eavis doesn ' t own or short individual stocks . he also doesn ' t invest in hedge funds or other private investment partnerships ."

steve ,
thanks for forwarding . actually , brian sent it to me on monday , and i followed up with ann and barbara . i have not spoken with brian yet because i am waiting for a green / red light from barbara as far as jade eaton is concerned . barbara and i spoke at length yesterday and she is concerned about the counterparty ' s reaction to a meeting with doj ( even an informal one ) . she plans to get back to me though with regard to whether they want me to get involved at this stage . i spoke to rick as well so he is up - to - date with the current status .
i ' ll let you know if anything further develops . thanks again .

0,ambient aliases the a formatting code specifies an alias to an ambient antecedent this is like a placement link except that the text that is inserted to replace the a formatting code is some portion of the ambient section s of the current document rather than the entire contents of some external document hence the a code makes it possible to incorporate pieces of ambient text typically source code into pod documentation specifically the a code is replaced by searching backwards through all preceding non pod parts of the document to locate the nearest prior substring that matches the contents of the a code the contents of an a code can specify a back reference of this type in one of two ways as a prefix keyword or as a delimited text range by default a aliases are keyword oriented that is the contents of an a block are treated as a keyword or prefix that introduces the desired text that text is located by searching backwards from the location of the a code to find the nearest preceding instance of the specified prefix in any previous ambient block the text that is then used to replace the a is the first symbol following that located prefix in this context a symbol is defined as a sequence of non whitespace characters terminated by a transition from an identifier character to a non identifier character for example in the following class pet has name description the class a class provides a a has attribute the a class formatting code would be replaced by pet since that is the sequence of non whitespace characters that immediately follows class in the preceding ambient source code likewise the a has formatting code would be replaced by name because that is the longest sequence of non whitespace characters that follows a has and terminates in an identifier to nonidentifier boundary in other words any formatting code of the form a prefix is replaced by the substring of the nearest preceding ambient block that matches the pattern prefix \\s \\s \\w \\w this default is designed to work well for the commonest kind of back reference in ambient text a reference to a code construct that was defined using a prefix keyword and whose name ends in an identifier the second and more general way of specifying an alias is to specify both a prefix and a postfix delimiter for the replacement text if the contents of an a formatting code include a range marker the sequence before the is treated as the left delimiter of the replacement text and the sequence after the is the right delimiter in this case there are no other constraints on the replacement text in particular it may contain any number of non identifier or whitespace characters for example class pet method eat food meal for description the a method method has the following argument list a this would be interpreted as the eat method has the following argument list food meal because the a specifies an alias to the closest preceding ambient text that is left delimited by a ' ' and right delimited by a ' ' to specify an alias in which the sequence is itself a left or right delimiter rather than the separator between the two use a v code constant range escapenumber escapenumber para the maximum value is a v explicit aliasing the replacement strings for a formatting codes are normally specified implicitly by the closest preceding ambient text that matches the contents of the a code however it is possible to override this behaviour and create an explicitly defined alias using the alias directive class agent alias component agent class transaction is activity description the a class class represents a transaction activity between two a component objects in the preceding example a class is a normal keyword alias which would be replaced by the closest preceding prefixed match transaction however a component is a defined alias which would be replaced by the explicitly specified text agent each back reference name defined by an alias directive is lexically scoped within the block structure of the surrounding pod to create global aliases define them at the start of the pod document at the outermost block level explicitly defined aliases always override normal prefix or delimited aliases and thereby allow you to refer to ambient constructs that would otherwise be inaccessible to an implicit back reference for example within the description block of the previous example the agent class couldn't be referred to as a class since the intervening transaction class hides it from the look behind matching of implicit back reference mechanism but the alias command allows the name of the earlier class to be associated with a distinct symbolic alias i e component which then allows it to be referred to unambiguously regardless of other intervening code another way of thinking of this is that explicitly defined aliases change the normal a substitution behaviour from being determined relatively by the location of the a code to being determined absolutely by the alias name itself an alias directive expects two arguments the name of the new alias the text with which that new alias is to be replaced the alias name may be any sequence of non whitespace characters the remainder of the line ignoring the whitespace immediately after the name is treated as the replacement text for example alias smith jones alias g t green tea alias gosh darn para a it a smith you spilled my a g t is equivalent to para gosh darn it jones you spilled my green tea to specify an alias name that includes a whitespace or a replacement text with surrounding whitespace use a v formatting code alias slow v slow alias v extra slow s l o w alias v ultra slow v s l o wv para the service was not merely a slow or even a extra slow it was a ultra slow although only the v code is significant within the name of an alias you can use any formatting code s within the replacement text alias v ultra slow s s l o w alias v hyper slow b s l o w in particular you can use an a code in the replacement text of an alias this is useful to preserve the abstract relationship between ambient code and pod documentation for example in the earlier agent example instead of class agent alias component agent the alias could have been defined class agent alias component a class so that the class name did not have to be repeated as part of the alias this approach has the important benefit that the alias would not have to be modified in any way if the name of the agent class were subsequently changed class operative alias component a class likewise in the earlier range example it would have been cleaner and more maintainable to write constant range escapenumber escapenumber alias max a v para the maximum value is a max explicit aliases also provide a way to retarget implicit back references if they are later invalidated by keyword changes in the source code for example given the following documented code class transaction my int trans counter description the a my int variable is used to track the total number of transactions active at any one time the value of a my int is incremented by a class 's c build submethod and decremented by the a class destructor if a subsequent redesign requires that the class be changed to a role and the lexical counter converted to a state variable then every corresponding a code in the documentation would have to be altered too role transaction state int trans counter description the a state int variable is used to track the total number of transactions active at any one time the value of a state int is incremented by a role 's c build submethod and decremented by the a role destructor a less onerous and error prone solution would be to leave the original a codes as is and insert aliases to override the default prefix back matching role transaction alias class a role state int trans counter alias v my int a state int description the a my int variable is used to track the total number of transactions active at any one time the value of a my int is incremented by the a class c build submethod and decremented by the a class destructor note that alias is a fundamental perldoc directive like begin or for it is not an instance of an abbreviated block hence there is no paragraph or delimited form of the encoding directive just as there is no paragraph or delimited form of begin

subject : macro questions
is the country facing sustained tight markets ? :
in general , capacity margins have been falling over the last few years as utilities have refraind from building baseload capacity , and others have focused on developing primarily peaking capacity . the last large building boom of coal plants ended in early 1970 ' s and nuclear boom dropped sharply after three mile island incident in 1979 . during 1990 ' s , projected capacity margins have fallen from the 15 - 20 % toward 10 % and below . outside of the california situation , nyc also poses a potential risk for this summer .
if general , however , by 2002 - 2003 , the amount of capacity proposed in each region more than covers normal load growth for meeting peak hour demand . remaining question relates to performance of existing coal and nuclear stacks , also what happens during periods of persistent drought .
will voaltility and prices remain high or lessen ? :
to the extent that more capacity becomes merchant oriented focusing in marginal cost economics , and transmission congestion persists , increased volatility will continue , especially in iso / pool type environments . prices will reflect primary fuel dynamics , especially the interplay between gas and oil . the case for lower prices will reflect an overbuild scenario beyond this year , coupled with slowing economic activity and low incidence of extreme weather events .
how fast can generation be added and what returns should be expected ?
the variability in development of greenfield capacity depends on time to permit at state or local levels . construction time is fairly constant . in general 18 months is reasonable time frame from concept to first fire . to the extent that power plants are project financed with minimum 30 equity , returns should be consistent with other comparable project financed opportunities available to fund managers . we do not expect any more fully debt financed facilities in the near term .
can companies make major profits owning generation long term ?
above average returns over time will reflect superior plant management skills and effective use of strategic market information . portfolio approach will aid in this case . if an oversupply situation occurs in the 2003 - 05 timeframe , significantly lower returns on capital could materialize .
is this the time to sell generation ?
because of recent market events in west , capacity has higher than historically observed
values . depending on overbuild scenario this may be an attractive time to sell capacity to those still in queue or hoping to build in near term . recent pool experience shows that capacity owners still have significant market power
how will supply demand balance change in various regions of country ?
weather normalized demand growth fairly consistent at 2 - 3 % on average overtime . future dynamics depend on economic growth , which suggests more load on coastal and in tech - concentrated areas . short - term demand reflects weather dynamics ( year 2000 a non - event for eastern interconnect , opposite in the west ! ) . aggressive capacity growth suggested in nepool , ercot , ecar , main and spp over next two years .
will natural gas continue to capture all the growth ?
virtually all capacity due on line is gas fired , however , incremental supply growth could come from investments in existing coal and nuclear stack , which can be more economic .
marketing ?
growth business will appear as more interaction solicited from enduser , and rates can become more dynamic .
too late for new entrants ?
most states still do not have switching of energy service providers , so still time to enter . barriers to entry include capabilities in brand management , retail marketing , effective integration of risk management and billing ability .
will only handful of customers be big winners ?
to the extent economies of scale and aggregation opportunities exist , there will be success to larger players but not to exclusion of niche player existance .
how diffentiated are the strategies ?
to date marketing is focused on lower rates and giving an alternative to existing service provider . this will have to develop beyond that .
how significant is the retail opp ?

i was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity
locally was ok , but that hedging had to be done with regional hub . the
problem with this model is that it describes helsinki before the bust !
another possiblity is the agency model , where the local trader acts under the
direction of the hub trader . this is where helsinki currently is ( although we
also have an independent manager on site ) . however , i am not so happy with
this , and rick causey certainly does not like it . perhaps we should recommend
independent risk managers in every office , but all correspondence and
settlement with regional hub ?"

before leaving for india i just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk
to jeff shankman on monday .
aside from myself , i wanted to remind you to talk about anshuman shrivastava ,
who is currently assistant manager in india , and has my recommendation for
promotion to manager . he is our point person on many dpc matters , and is
also the person i have used on most fuel related issues . he will be a real
asset to jeff when located in houston . sinc he is single , and quite young ,

0,"to all :
as of today , bridgeline has $ 14 mm of cash and expects to get $ 15 mm from the payment of oct receivables by the end of the month . they have fully drawn down the $ 35 mm revolver that we put in place earlier this year . trevor mihalik ( bridgeline cfo ) is preparing a cashflow forecast for bridgeline from now to the end of the year and next year .
bridgeline ' s major cash needs are to fund working capital ( payables and margin calls ) and to purchase gas that must be used to dewater the storage cavern ( enron # 1 ) that we contributed to the partnership . the dewatering process is now underway and will be completed mid - march 2002 . at a gas price of $ 2 . 50 and , working gas volume of 6 bcf , the total cash need for working gas will be approx . $ 15 mm .
we are working with bridgeline to find other sources of financing for the working gas that would enable them to make ( and accelerate ) the 2001 cash distribution to the partners . alternatives we are considering to fund the working gas : ( i ) increase the revolver from $ 35 mm to $ 70 mm , ( ii ) find third parties ( enron ? ) to enter into park - and - lend arrangements that would give bridgeline the physical gas they need to dewater the facility without having to pay cash for it . most options will require chevron / texaco approval , which may come at a price .
i will distribute the cash flow statement when i receive it and jean and i will meet with randy and trevor next week to discuss alternative financing / park - and - lend arrangements . i have been cloaking my questions on the need for cash under the guise of putting together the 2002 plan ( budget , headcount , capital needs , insurance requirements , etc . ) . we should adhere to this commercial context so that we don ' t provide leverage to bridgeline and chevron / texaco in any commercial discussions . i will admit , however , given the headlines , it does not take a genius to figure out we need cash .
regards ,
brian

vince ,
i got the article . i can make a copy for you when i get back .
the article is pretty much for marketing purpose . my reading
from that paper is as follows :
1 . solve optimal exercise bounday using stocastic dp ;
2 . runing price trajectory to tracking storage level to give average storage
cycling ;
our model addresses the same issues , althrough maybe the implementation is
not quite the same .
i will fax to you if i can find the article here .
regards ,

0,i might have found an error but i am not sure i just have a few questions about the following article http live gnome org orca ubuntufeisty here are the points of concern i have please look at this and see if i have misunderstood or help me with getting a stable install first of all i did get the live cd http cdimages ubuntu com daily live current feisty desktop iescapenumber iso now i have it on a cd and have tried several times to get the following to happen it boots just fine but when it stops orca does not come up talking i have to launch it independently of all the other startup stuff by using the alt fescapenumber run application dialog now when i booted i did this when the drive stopped spinning the first time after the short spin i immediately pressed fescapenumber this should it is stated cause the list of accessibility functions to appear i really wonder if it does and please forgive me for saying this here's why when i look into the isolinux directory on the ubuntu escapenumber escapenumber disk i see nothing about accessibility mentioned there in fact take a look at the following file mnt cdrom isolinux fescapenumber txt this is with the ubuntu disk in your drive and running something else on the machine if it gives a list of what is to appear on the screen when this function key is pressed look closely it actually mentions something about boot parameters for machines with special hardware configurations not accessibility now when you are in this menu you are supposed to hit escapenumber to give focus to the orca screen reader here's another concern it does not seem to work i may be wrong but i would appreciate some help here if that description of those special hardware configurations is on there it is impossible to press escapenumber to give foxus to an element that is not around anywhere now something must happen but not the whole thing when i just let ubuntu boot up then try to access orca it does not work right at all in fact it is impossible to get anything permanent out of it it allows you to set up part of the accessibility but not all now when i press escapenumber from the whatever's there after pressing fescapenumber there is a change even though orca does not come up talking i get the configuration gui when i launch it this is strange indeed now here's another concern i have when you finish setting up orca none of the settings appears to be taking effect in fact i appear to be losing controls gradually how strange on a live cd the other day i was able to get to the volume control for the master system volume it does not exist anymore just last night i was able to log in and out and all this with no problem causing the settings i had in the orca configuration dialog to take effect not today won't do it i cannot get the quit option on the system menu to do a thing other than send me back to the desktop now the last point of concern is this on the article page it says to use the control tab to get out of the city combo box when you have your city and region selected won't do it once you get in there there's no way out except to shut the entier machine down losing your settings and all how do you really get that installer to work if anyone out there has had better results than this i would appreciate some help if this cannot be accomplished it will be necessary to wait for the next stable release of the system i am using to come out then re invent all the things that have been done in the graphical environment i would really like to have some help however thanks spie smith c s f c computer scientist for christ speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup
