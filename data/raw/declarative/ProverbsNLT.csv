    examining every path he takes.",17
522," An evil man is held captive by his own sins;
    they are ropes that catch and hold him.",21
523," He will die for lack of selfcontrol;
    he will be lost because of his great foolishness.",21
601,"My child, if you have put up security for a friends debt
    or agreed to guarantee the debt of a stranger",24
602," if you have trapped yourself by your agreement
    and are caught by what you said",17

    or governor or ruler to make them work,",16
608," they labor hard all summer,
    gathering food for the winter.",13
609," But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep?
    When will you wake up?",19
610," A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,
    a little folding of the hands to rest",20
611," then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit;
    scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.",22
612," What are worthless and wicked people like?
    They are constant liars,",15
613," signaling their deceit with a wink of the eye,
    a nudge of the foot, or the wiggle of fingers.",25
614," Their perverted hearts plot evil,
    and they constantly stir up trouble.",15
615," But they will be destroyed suddenly,
    broken in an instant beyond all hope of healing.",18
616," There are six things the Lord hates
    no, seven things he detests:",17
617," haughty eyes,
    a lying tongue,
    hands that kill the innocent,",16
618," a heart that plots evil,
    feet that race to do wrong,",14
619," a false witness who pours out lies,
    a person who sows discord in a family.",19
620," My son, obey your fathers commands,
    and dont neglect your mothers instruction.",16
621," Keep their words always in your heart.
    Tie them around your neck.",15
622," When you walk, their counsel will lead you.
    When you sleep, they will protect you.
    When you wake up, they will advise you.",31
623," For their command is a lamp
    and their instruction a light;
their corrective discipline
    is the way to life.",25
624," It will keep you from the immoral woman,
    from the smooth tongue of a promiscuous woman.",21
625," Dont lust for her beauty.
    Dont let her coy glances seduce you.",17
626," For a prostitute will bring you to poverty,
    but sleeping with another mans wife will cost you your life.",22
627," Can a man scoop a flame into his lap
    and not have his clothes catch on fire?",20
628," Can he walk on hot coals
    and not blister his feet?",15
629," So it is with the man who sleeps with another mans wife.
    He who embraces her will not go unpunished.",25
630," Excuses might be found for a thief
    who steals because he is starving.",17
631," But if he is caught, he must pay back seven times what he stole,
    even if he has to sell everything in his house.",28
632," But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool,
    for he destroys himself.",17
633," He will be wounded and disgraced.
    His shame will never be erased.",16
634," For the womans jealous husband will be furious,
    and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.",22
635," He will accept no compensation,
    nor be satisfied with a payoff of any size.",17
701,"Follow my advice, my son;
    always treasure my commands.",13
702," Obey my commands and live!
    Guard my instructions as you guard your own eyes.",18
703," Tie them on your fingers as a reminder.
    Write them deep within your heart.",17
704," Love wisdom like a sister;
    make insight a beloved member of your family.",16
705," Let them protect you from an affair with an immoral woman,
    from listening to the flattery of a promiscuous woman.",26
706," While I was at the window of my house,
    looking through the curtain,",16
707," I saw some naive young men,
    and one in particular who lacked common sense.",17
708," He was crossing the street near the house of an immoral woman,
    strolling down the path by her house.",23
709," It was at twilight, in the evening,
    as deep darkness fell.",15
710," The woman approached him,
    seductively dressed and sly of heart.",16
711," She was the brash, rebellious type,
    never content to stay at home.",18
712," She is often in the streets and markets,
    soliciting at every corner.",16
713," She threw her arms around him and kissed him,
    and with a brazen look she said,",20
714," Ive just made my peace offerings
    and fulfilled my vows.",13
715," Youre the one I was looking for!
    I came out to find you, and here you are!",22
716," My bed is spread with beautiful blankets,
    with colored sheets of Egyptian linen.",16
717," Ive perfumed my bed
    with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.",18
718," Come, lets drink our fill of love until morning.
    Lets enjoy each others caresses,",19
719," for my husband is not home.
    Hes away on a long trip.",16
720," He has taken a wallet full of money with him
    and wont return until later this month.",20
721," So she seduced him with her pretty speech
    and enticed him with her flattery.",20
722," He followed her at once,
    like an ox going to the slaughter.
He was like a stag caught in a trap,",25
723,"     awaiting the arrow that would pierce its heart.
He was like a bird flying into a snare,
    little knowing it would cost him his life.",32
724," So listen to me, my sons,
    and pay attention to my words.",16
725," Dont let your hearts stray away toward her.
    Dont wander down her wayward path.",18
726," For she has been the ruin of many;
    many men have been her victims.",17
727," Her house is the road to the grave.
    Her bedroom is the den of death.",18
801,"Listen as Wisdom calls out!
    Hear as understanding raises her voice!",14
802," On the hilltop along the road,
    she takes her stand at the crossroads.",18
803," By the gates at the entrance to the town,
    on the road leading in, she cries aloud,",21
804," I call to you, to all of you!
    I raise my voice to all people.",19
805," You simple people, use good judgment.
    You foolish people, show some understanding.",17
806," Listen to me! For I have important things to tell you.
    Everything I say is right,",20
807," for I speak the truth
    and detest every kind of deception.",15
808," My advice is wholesome.
    There is nothing devious or crooked in it.",17
809," My words are plain to anyone with understanding,
    clear to those with knowledge.",16
810," Choose my instruction rather than silver,
    and knowledge rather than pure gold.",15
811," For wisdom is far more valuable than rubies.
    Nothing you desire can compare with it.",19
812," I, Wisdom, live together with good judgment.
    I know where to discover knowledge and discernment.",21
813," All who fear the Lord will hate evil.
    Therefore, I hate pride and arrogance,
    corruption and perverse speech.",24

    and the first handfuls of soil.",18

    so they would not spread beyond their boundaries.
And when he marked off the earths foundations,",32

I was his constant delight,
    rejoicing always in his presence.",23
