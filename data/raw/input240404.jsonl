So it's there as well as here. \n\n`` If there's any one piece of advice that I would give to any youth it would be to take every opportunity to develop your ability to identify people who bring you good and people who feed on creating strife. The difficulty is that the latter always try to portray the former. And they're adept at fooling those who are low or desperate to have someone in their life. They use the goodness of others to make themselves feel better. If you can sense intuitively those who are selfish and only take, you will always surround yourself with those who would happily see you elevated and praised.''\n"}

I would have a religion that is the widely practiced religion and hold a saint to high acclaim. This saint was one who decreed that all power belongs to a higher being. That no man or woman could hold such and could not practice such power. In the early days the people who had such power or gifts where killed and the sect they formed was destroyed and never to be talked of again. So now anyone showing such promise is killed. The hero in this story finds themselves called to challenge, they are hunted but are rescued by a fringe group or sect called lighters. That is where the adventure begins.\n"}
