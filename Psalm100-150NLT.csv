10001," Shout with joy to the Lord, all the earth!"
10002,"     Worship the Lord with gladness.
    Come before him, singing with joy."
10003," Acknowledge that the Lord is God!
    He made us, and we are his.
    We are his people, the sheep of his pasture."
10004," Enter his gates with thanksgiving;
    go into his courts with praise.
    Give thanks to him and praise his name."
10005," For the Lord is good.
    His unfailing love continues forever,
    and his faithfulness continues to each generation."
10101," I will sing of your love and justice, Lord.
    I will praise you with songs."
10102," I will be careful to live a blameless life
    when will you come to help me?
I will lead a life of integrity
    in my own home."
10103," I will refuse to look at
    anything vile and vulgar.
I hate all who deal crookedly;
    I will have nothing to do with them."
10104," I will reject perverse ideas
    and stay away from every evil."
10105," I will not tolerate people who slander their neighbors.
    I will not endure conceit and pride."
10106," I will search for faithful people
    to be my companions.
Only those who are above reproach
    will be allowed to serve me."
10107," I will not allow deceivers to serve in my house,
    and liars will not stay in my presence."
10108," My daily task will be to ferret out the wicked
    and free the city of the Lord from their grip."
10201," Lord, hear my prayer!
    Listen to my plea!"
10202," Dont turn away from me
    in my time of distress.
Bend down to listen,
    and answer me quickly when I call to you."
10203," For my days disappear like smoke,
    and my bones burn like redhot coals."
10204," My heart is sick, withered like grass,
    and I have lost my appetite."
10205," Because of my groaning,
    I am reduced to skin and bones."
10206," I am like an owl in the desert,
    like a little owl in a faroff wilderness."
10207," I lie awake,
    lonely as a solitary bird on the roof."
10208," My enemies taunt me day after day.
    They mock and curse me."
10209," I eat ashes for food.
    My tears run down into my drink"
10210," because of your anger and wrath.
    For you have picked me up and thrown me out."
10211," My life passes as swiftly as the evening shadows.
    I am withering away like grass."
10212," But you, O Lord, will sit on your throne forever.
    Your fame will endure to every generation."
10213," You will arise and have mercy on Jerusalem
    and now is the time to pity her,
    now is the time you promised to help."
10214," For your people love every stone in her walls
    and cherish even the dust in her streets."
10215," Then the nations will tremble before the Lord.
    The kings of the earth will tremble before his glory."
10216," For the Lord will rebuild Jerusalem.
    He will appear in his glory."
10217," He will listen to the prayers of the destitute.
    He will not reject their pleas."
10218," Let this be recorded for future generations,
    so that a people not yet born will praise the Lord."
10219," Tell them the Lord looked down
    from his heavenly sanctuary.
He looked down to earth from heaven"
10220,"     to hear the groans of the prisoners,
    to release those condemned to die."
10221," And so the Lords fame will be celebrated in Zion,
    his praises in Jerusalem,"
10222," when multitudes gather together
    and kingdoms come to worship the Lord."
10223," He broke my strength in midlife,
    cutting short my days."
10224," But I cried to him, O my God, who lives forever,
    dont take my life while I am so young!"
10225," Long ago you laid the foundation of the earth
    and made the heavens with your hands."
10226," They will perish, but you remain forever;
    they will wear out like old clothing.
You will change them like a garment
    and discard them."
10227," But you are always the same;
    you will live forever."
10228," The children of your people
    will live in security.
Their childrens children
    will thrive in your presence."
10301," Let all that I am praise the Lord;
    with my whole heart, I will praise his holy name."
10302," Let all that I am praise the Lord;
    may I never forget the good things he does for me."
10303," He forgives all my sins
    and heals all my diseases."
10304," He redeems me from death
    and crowns me with love and tender mercies."
10305," He fills my life with good things.
    My youth is renewed like the eagles!"
10306," The Lord gives righteousness
    and justice to all who are treated unfairly."
10307," He revealed his character to Moses
    and his deeds to the people of Israel."
10308," The Lord is compassionate and merciful,
    slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love."
10309," He will not constantly accuse us,
    nor remain angry forever."
10310," He does not punish us for all our sins;
    he does not deal harshly with us, as we deserve."
10311," For his unfailing love toward those who fear him
    is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth."
10312," He has removed our sins as far from us
    as the east is from the west."
10313," The Lord is like a father to his children,
    tender and compassionate to those who fear him."
10314," For he knows how weak we are;
    he remembers we are only dust."
10315," Our days on earth are like grass;
    like wildflowers, we bloom and die."
10316," The wind blows, and we are gone
    as though we had never been here."
10317," But the love of the Lord remains forever
    with those who fear him.
His salvation extends to the childrens children"
10318,"     of those who are faithful to his covenant,
    of those who obey his commandments!"
10319," The Lord has made the heavens his throne;
    from there he rules over everything."
10320," Praise the Lord, you angels,
    you mighty ones who carry out his plans,
    listening for each of his commands."
10321," Yes, praise the Lord, you armies of angels
    who serve him and do his will!"
10322," Praise the Lord, everything he has created,
    everything in all his kingdom.
Let all that I am praise the Lord."
10401," Let all that I am praise the Lord.
O Lord my God, how great you are!
    You are robed with honor and majesty."
10402,"     You are dressed in a robe of light.
You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens;"
10403,"     you lay out the rafters of your home in the rain clouds.
You make the clouds your chariot;
    you ride upon the wings of the wind."
10404," The winds are your messengers;
    flames of fire are your servants."
10405," You placed the world on its foundation
    so it would never be moved."
10406," You clothed the earth with floods of water,
    water that covered even the mountains."
10407," At your command, the water fled;
    at the sound of your thunder, it hurried away."
10408," Mountains rose and valleys sank
    to the levels you decreed."
10409," Then you set a firm boundary for the seas,
    so they would never again cover the earth."
10410," You make springs pour water into the ravines,
    so streams gush down from the mountains."
10411," They provide water for all the animals,
    and the wild donkeys quench their thirst."
10412," The birds nest beside the streams
    and sing among the branches of the trees."
10413," You send rain on the mountains from your heavenly home,
    and you fill the earth with the fruit of your labor."
10414," You cause grass to grow for the livestock
    and plants for people to use.
You allow them to produce food from the earth"
10415,"     wine to make them glad,
olive oil to soothe their skin,
    and bread to give them strength."
10416," The trees of the Lord are well cared for
    the cedars of Lebanon that he planted."
10417," There the birds make their nests,
    and the storks make their homes in the cypresses."
10418," High in the mountains live the wild goats,
    and the rocks form a refuge for the hyraxes."
10419," You made the moon to mark the seasons,
    and the sun knows when to set."
10420," You send the darkness, and it becomes night,
    when all the forest animals prowl about."
10421," Then the young lions roar for their prey,
    stalking the food provided by God."
10422," At dawn they slink back
    into their dens to rest."
10423," Then people go off to their work,
    where they labor until evening."
10424," O Lord, what a variety of things you have made!
    In wisdom you have made them all.
    The earth is full of your creatures."
10425," Here is the ocean, vast and wide,
    teeming with life of every kind,
    both large and small."
10426," See the ships sailing along,
    and Leviathan, which you made to play in the sea."
10427," They all depend on you
    to give them food as they need it."
10428," When you supply it, they gather it.
    You open your hand to feed them,
    and they are richly satisfied."
10429," But if you turn away from them, they panic.
    When you take away their breath,
    they die and turn again to dust."
10430," When you give them your breath, life is created,
    and you renew the face of the earth."
10431," May the glory of the Lord continue forever!
    The Lord takes pleasure in all he has made!"
10432," The earth trembles at his glance;
    the mountains smoke at his touch."
10433," I will sing to the Lord as long as I live.
    I will praise my God to my last breath!"
10434," May all my thoughts be pleasing to him,
    for I rejoice in the Lord."
10435," Let all sinners vanish from the face of the earth;
    let the wicked disappear forever.
Let all that I am praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord!"
10501," Give thanks to the Lord and proclaim his greatness.
    Let the whole world know what he has done."
10502," Sing to him; yes, sing his praises.
    Tell everyone about his wonderful deeds."
10503," Exult in his holy name;
    rejoice, you who worship the Lord."
10504," Search for the Lord and for his strength;
    continually seek him."
10505," Remember the wonders he has performed,
    his miracles, and the rulings he has given,"
10506," you children of his servant Abraham,
    you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones."
10507," He is the Lord our God.
    His justice is seen throughout the land."
10508," He always stands by his covenant
    the commitment he made to a thousand generations."
10509," This is the covenant he made with Abraham
    and the oath he swore to Isaac."
10510," He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
    and to the people of Israel as a neverending covenant:"
10511," I will give you the land of Canaan
    as your special possession."
10512," He said this when they were few in number,
    a tiny group of strangers in Canaan."
10513," They wandered from nation to nation,
    from one kingdom to another."
10514," Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.
    He warned kings on their behalf:"
10515," Do not touch my chosen people,
    and do not hurt my prophets."
10516," He called for a famine on the land of Canaan,
    cutting off its food supply."
10517," Then he sent someone to Egypt ahead of them
    Joseph, who was sold as a slave."
10518," They bruised his feet with fetters
    and placed his neck in an iron collar."
10519," Until the time came to fulfill his dreams,
    the Lord tested Josephs character."
10520," Then Pharaoh sent for him and set him free;
    the ruler of the nation opened his prison door."
10521," Joseph was put in charge of all the kings household;
    he became ruler over all the kings possessions."
10522," He could instruct the kings aides as he pleased
    and teach the kings advisers."
10523," Then Israel arrived in Egypt;
    Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham."
10524," And the Lord multiplied the people of Israel
    until they became too mighty for their enemies."
10525," Then he turned the Egyptians against the Israelites,
    and they plotted against the Lords servants."
10526," But the Lord sent his servant Moses,
    along with Aaron, whom he had chosen."
10527," They performed miraculous signs among the Egyptians,
    and wonders in the land of Ham."
10528," The Lord blanketed Egypt in darkness,
    for they had defied his commands to let his people go."
10529," He turned their water into blood,
    poisoning all the fish."
10530," Then frogs overran the land
    and even invaded the kings bedrooms."
10531," When the Lord spoke, flies descended on the Egyptians,
    and gnats swarmed across Egypt."
10532," He sent them hail instead of rain,
    and lightning flashed over the land."
10533," He ruined their grapevines and fig trees
    and shattered all the trees."
10534," He spoke, and hordes of locusts came
    young locusts beyond number."
10535," They ate up everything green in the land,
    destroying all the crops in their fields."
10536," Then he killed the oldest son in each Egyptian home,
    the pride and joy of each family."
10537," The Lord brought his people out of Egypt, loaded with silver and gold;
    and not one among the tribes of Israel even stumbled."
10538," Egypt was glad when they were gone,
    for they feared them greatly."
10539," The Lord spread a cloud above them as a covering
    and gave them a great fire to light the darkness."
10540," They asked for meat, and he sent them quail;
    he satisfied their hunger with mannabread from heaven."
10541," He split open a rock, and water gushed out
    to form a river through the dry wasteland."
10542," For he remembered his sacred promise
    to his servant Abraham."
10543," So he brought his people out of Egypt with joy,
    his chosen ones with rejoicing."
10544," He gave his people the lands of pagan nations,
    and they harvested crops that others had planted."
10545," All this happened so they would follow his decrees
    and obey his instructions.
Praise the Lord!"
10601," Praise the Lord!
Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!
    His faithful love endures forever."
10602," Who can list the glorious miracles of the Lord?
    Who can ever praise him enough?"
10603," There is joy for those who deal justly with others
    and always do what is right."
10604," Remember me, Lord, when you show favor to your people;
    come near and rescue me."
10605," Let me share in the prosperity of your chosen ones.
    Let me rejoice in the joy of your people;
    let me praise you with those who are your heritage."
10606," Like our ancestors, we have sinned.
    We have done wrong! We have acted wickedly!"
10607," Our ancestors in Egypt
    were not impressed by the Lords miraculous deeds.
They soon forgot his many acts of kindness to them.
    Instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea."
10608," Even so, he saved them
    to defend the honor of his name
    and to demonstrate his mighty power."
10609," He commanded the Red Sea to dry up.
    He led Israel across the sea as if it were a desert."
10610," So he rescued them from their enemies
    and redeemed them from their foes."
10611," Then the water returned and covered their enemies;
    not one of them survived."
10612," Then his people believed his promises.
    Then they sang his praise."
10613," Yet how quickly they forgot what he had done!
    They wouldnt wait for his counsel!"
10614," In the wilderness their desires ran wild,
    testing Gods patience in that dry wasteland."
10615," So he gave them what they asked for,
    but he sent a plague along with it."
10616," The people in the camp were jealous of Moses
    and envious of Aaron, the Lords holy priest."
10617," Because of this, the earth opened up;
    it swallowed Dathan
    and buried Abiram and the other rebels."
10618," Fire fell upon their followers;
    a flame consumed the wicked."
10619," The people made a calf at Mount Sinai;
    they bowed before an image made of gold."
10620," They traded their glorious God
    for a statue of a grasseating bull."
10621," They forgot God, their savior,
    who had done such great things in Egypt"
10622," such wonderful things in the land of Ham,
    such awesome deeds at the Red Sea."
10623," So he declared he would destroy them.
    But Moses, his chosen one, stepped between the Lord and the people.
    He begged him to turn from his anger and not destroy them."
10624," The people refused to enter the pleasant land,
    for they wouldnt believe his promise to care for them."
10625," Instead, they grumbled in their tents
    and refused to obey the Lord."
10626," Therefore, he solemnly swore
    that he would kill them in the wilderness,"
10627," that he would scatter their descendants among the nations,
    exiling them to distant lands."
10628," Then our ancestors joined in the worship of Baal at Peor;
    they even ate sacrifices offered to the dead!"
10629," They angered the Lord with all these things,
    so a plague broke out among them."
10630," But Phinehas had the courage to intervene,
    and the plague was stopped."
10631," So he has been regarded as a righteous man
    ever since that time."
10632," At Meribah, too, they angered the Lord,
    causing Moses serious trouble."
10633," They made Moses angry,
    and he spoke foolishly."
10634," Israel failed to destroy the nations in the land,
    as the Lord had commanded them."
10635," Instead, they mingled among the pagans
    and adopted their evil customs."
10636," They worshiped their idols,
    which led to their downfall."
10637," They even sacrificed their sons
    and their daughters to the demons."
10638," They shed innocent blood,
    the blood of their sons and daughters.
By sacrificing them to the idols of Canaan,
    they polluted the land with murder."
10639," They defiled themselves by their evil deeds,
    and their love of idols was adultery in the Lords sight."
10640," That is why the Lords anger burned against his people,
    and he abhorred his own special possession."
10641," He handed them over to pagan nations,
    and they were ruled by those who hated them."
10642," Their enemies crushed them
    and brought them under their cruel power."
10643," Again and again he rescued them,
    but they chose to rebel against him,
    and they were finally destroyed by their sin."
10644," Even so, he pitied them in their distress
    and listened to their cries."
10645," He remembered his covenant with them
    and relented because of his unfailing love."
10646," He even caused their captors
    to treat them with kindness."
10647," Save us, O Lord our God!
    Gather us back from among the nations,
so we can thank your holy name
    and rejoice and praise you."
10648," Praise the Lord, the God of Israel,
    who lives from everlasting to everlasting!
Let all the people say, Amen!
Praise the Lord!"
10701," Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!
    His faithful love endures forever."
10702," Has the Lord redeemed you? Then speak out!
    Tell others he has redeemed you from your enemies."
10703," For he has gathered the exiles from many lands,
    from east and west,
    from north and south."
10704," Some wandered in the wilderness,
    lost and homeless."
10705," Hungry and thirsty,
    they nearly died."
10706," Lord, help! they cried in their trouble,
    and he rescued them from their distress."
10707," He led them straight to safety,
    to a city where they could live."
10708," Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them."
10709," For he satisfies the thirsty
    and fills the hungry with good things."
10710," Some sat in darkness and deepest gloom,
    imprisoned in iron chains of misery."
10711," They rebelled against the words of God,
    scorning the counsel of the Most High."
10712," That is why he broke them with hard labor;
    they fell, and no one was there to help them."
10713," Lord, help! they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress."
10714," He led them from the darkness and deepest gloom;
    he snapped their chains."
10715," Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them."
10716," For he broke down their prison gates of bronze;
    he cut apart their bars of iron."
10717," Some were fools; they rebelled
    and suffered for their sins."
10718," They couldnt stand the thought of food,
    and they were knocking on deaths door."
10719," Lord, help! they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress."
10720," He sent out his word and healed them,
    snatching them from the door of death."
10721," Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them."
10722," Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
    and sing joyfully about his glorious acts."
10723," Some went off to sea in ships,
    plying the trade routes of the world."
10724," They, too, observed the Lords power in action,
    his impressive works on the deepest seas."
10725," He spoke, and the winds rose,
    stirring up the waves."
10726," Their ships were tossed to the heavens
    and plunged again to the depths;
    the sailors cringed in terror."
10727," They reeled and staggered like drunkards
    and were at their wits end."
10728," Lord, help! they cried in their trouble,
    and he saved them from their distress."
10729," He calmed the storm to a whisper
    and stilled the waves."
10730," What a blessing was that stillness
    as he brought them safely into harbor!"
10731," Let them praise the Lord for his great love
    and for the wonderful things he has done for them."
10732," Let them exalt him publicly before the congregation
    and before the leaders of the nation."
10733," He changes rivers into deserts,
    and springs of water into dry, thirsty land."
10734," He turns the fruitful land into salty wastelands,
    because of the wickedness of those who live there."
10735," But he also turns deserts into pools of water,
    the dry land into springs of water."
10736," He brings the hungry to settle there
    and to build their cities."
10737," They sow their fields, plant their vineyards,
    and harvest their bumper crops."
10738," How he blesses them!
    They raise large families there,
    and their herds of livestock increase."
10739," When they decrease in number and become impoverished
    through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,"
10740," the Lord pours contempt on their princes,
    causing them to wander in trackless wastelands."
10741," But he rescues the poor from trouble
    and increases their families like flocks of sheep."
10742," The godly will see these things and be glad,
    while the wicked are struck silent."
10743," Those who are wise will take all this to heart;
    they will see in our history the faithful love of the Lord."
10801," My heart is confident in you, O God;
    no wonder I can sing your praises with all my heart!"
10802," Wake up, lyre and harp!
    I will wake the dawn with my song."
10803," I will thank you, Lord, among all the people.
    I will sing your praises among the nations."
10804," For your unfailing love is higher than the heavens.
    Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds."
10805," Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens.
    May your glory shine over all the earth."
10806," Now rescue your beloved people.
    Answer and save us by your power."
10807," God has promised this by his holiness:
I will divide up Shechem with joy.
    I will measure out the valley of Succoth."
10808," Gilead is mine,
    and Manasseh, too.
Ephraim, my helmet, will produce my warriors,
    and Judah, my scepter, will produce my kings."
10809," But Moab, my washbasin, will become my servant,
    and I will wipe my feet on Edom
    and shout in triumph over Philistia."
10810," Who will bring me into the fortified city?
    Who will bring me victory over Edom?"
10811," Have you rejected us, O God?
    Will you no longer march with our armies?"
10812," Oh, please help us against our enemies,
    for all human help is useless."
10813," With Gods help we will do mighty things,
    for he will trample down our foes."
10901," O God, whom I praise,
    dont stand silent and aloof"
10902," while the wicked slander me
    and tell lies about me."
10903," They surround me with hateful words
    and fight against me for no reason."
10904," I love them, but they try to destroy me with accusations
    even as I am praying for them!"
10905," They repay evil for good,
    and hatred for my love."
10906," They say, Get an evil person to turn against him.
    Send an accuser to bring him to trial."
10907," When his case comes up for judgment,
    let him be pronounced guilty.
    Count his prayers as sins."
10908," Let his years be few;
    let someone else take his position."
10909," May his children become fatherless,
    and his wife a widow."
10910," May his children wander as beggars
    and be driven from their ruined homes."
10911," May creditors seize his entire estate,
    and strangers take all he has earned."
10912," Let no one be kind to him;
    let no one pity his fatherless children."
10913," May all his offspring die.
    May his family name be blotted out in the next generation."
10914," May the Lord never forget the sins of his fathers;
    may his mothers sins never be erased from the record."
10915," May the Lord always remember these sins,
    and may his name disappear from human memory."
10916," For he refused all kindness to others;
    he persecuted the poor and needy,
    and he hounded the brokenhearted to death."
10917," He loved to curse others;
    now you curse him.
He never blessed others;
    now dont you bless him."
10918," Cursing is as natural to him as his clothing,
    or the water he drinks,
    or the rich food he eats."
10919," Now may his curses return and cling to him like clothing;
    may they be tied around him like a belt."
10920," May those curses become the Lords punishment
    for my accusers who speak evil of me."
10921," But deal well with me, O Sovereign Lord,
    for the sake of your own reputation!
Rescue me
    because you are so faithful and good."
10922," For I am poor and needy,
    and my heart is full of pain."
10923," I am fading like a shadow at dusk;
    I am brushed off like a locust."
10924," My knees are weak from fasting,
    and I am skin and bones."
10925," I am a joke to people everywhere;
    when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn."
10926," Help me, O Lord my God!
    Save me because of your unfailing love."
10927," Let them see that this is your doing,
    that you yourself have done it, Lord."
10928," Then let them curse me if they like,
    but you will bless me!
When they attack me, they will be disgraced!
    But I, your servant, will go right on rejoicing!"
10929," May my accusers be clothed with disgrace;
    may their humiliation cover them like a cloak."
10930," But I will give repeated thanks to the Lord,
    praising him to everyone."
10931," For he stands beside the needy,
    ready to save them from those who condemn them."
11001," The Lord said to my Lord,
    Sit in the place of honor at my right hand
until I humble your enemies,
    making them a footstool under your feet."
11002," The Lord will extend your powerful kingdom from Jerusalem;
    you will rule over your enemies."
11003," When you go to war,
    your people will serve you willingly.
You are arrayed in holy garments,
    and your strength will be renewed each day like the morning dew."
11004," The Lord has taken an oath and will not break his vow:
    You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."
11005," The Lord stands at your right hand to protect you.
    He will strike down many kings when his anger erupts."
11006," He will punish the nations
    and fill their lands with corpses;
    he will shatter heads over the whole earth."
11007," But he himself will be refreshed from brooks along the way.
    He will be victorious."
11101," Praise the Lord!
I will thank the Lord with all my heart
    as I meet with his godly people."
11102," How amazing are the deeds of the Lord!
    All who delight in him should ponder them."
11103," Everything he does reveals his glory and majesty.
    His righteousness never fails."
11104," He causes us to remember his wonderful works.
    How gracious and merciful is our Lord!"
11105," He gives food to those who fear him;
    he always remembers his covenant."
11106," He has shown his great power to his people
    by giving them the lands of other nations."
11107," All he does is just and good,
    and all his commandments are trustworthy."
11108," They are forever true,
    to be obeyed faithfully and with integrity."
11109," He has paid a full ransom for his people.
    He has guaranteed his covenant with them forever.
    What a holy, aweinspiring name he has!"
11110," Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true wisdom.
    All who obey his commandments will grow in wisdom.
Praise him forever!"
11201," Praise the Lord!
How joyful are those who fear the Lord
    and delight in obeying his commands."
11202," Their children will be successful everywhere;
    an entire generation of godly people will be blessed."
11203," They themselves will be wealthy,
    and their good deeds will last forever."
11204," Light shines in the darkness for the godly.
    They are generous, compassionate, and righteous."
11205," Good comes to those who lend money generously
    and conduct their business fairly."
11206," Such people will not be overcome by evil.
    Those who are righteous will be long remembered."
11207," They do not fear bad news;
    they confidently trust the Lord to care for them."
11208," They are confident and fearless
    and can face their foes triumphantly."
11209," They share freely and give generously to those in need.
    Their good deeds will be remembered forever.
    They will have influence and honor."
11210," The wicked will see this and be infuriated.
    They will grind their teeth in anger;
    they will slink away, their hopes thwarted."
11301," Praise the Lord!
Yes, give praise, O servants of the Lord.
    Praise the name of the Lord!"
11302," Blessed be the name of the Lord
    now and forever."
11303," Everywherefrom east to west
    praise the name of the Lord."
11304," For the Lord is high above the nations;
    his glory is higher than the heavens."
11305," Who can be compared with the Lord our God,
    who is enthroned on high?"
11306," He stoops to look down
    on heaven and on earth."
11307," He lifts the poor from the dust
    and the needy from the garbage dump."
11308," He sets them among princes,
    even the princes of his own people!"
11309," He gives the childless woman a family,
    making her a happy mother.
Praise the Lord!"
11401," When the Israelites escaped from Egypt
    when the family of Jacob left that foreign land"
11402," the land of Judah became Gods sanctuary,
    and Israel became his kingdom."
11403," The Red Sea saw them coming and hurried out of their way!
    The water of the Jordan River turned away."
11404," The mountains skipped like rams,
    the hills like lambs!"
11405," Whats wrong, Red Sea, that made you hurry out of their way?
    What happened, Jordan River, that you turned away?"
11406," Why, mountains, did you skip like rams?
    Why, hills, like lambs?"
11407," Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,
    at the presence of the God of Jacob."
11408," He turned the rock into a pool of water;
    yes, a spring of water flowed from solid rock."
11501," Not to us, O Lord, not to us,
    but to your name goes all the glory
    for your unfailing love and faithfulness."
11502," Why let the nations say,
    Where is their God?"
11503," Our God is in the heavens,
    and he does as he wishes."
11504," Their idols are merely things of silver and gold,
    shaped by human hands."
11505," They have mouths but cannot speak,
    and eyes but cannot see."
11506," They have ears but cannot hear,
    and noses but cannot smell."
11507," They have hands but cannot feel,
    and feet but cannot walk,
    and throats but cannot make a sound."
11508," And those who make idols are just like them,
    as are all who trust in them."
11509," O Israel, trust the Lord!
    He is your helper and your shield."
11510," O priests, descendants of Aaron, trust the Lord!
    He is your helper and your shield."
11511," All you who fear the Lord, trust the Lord!
    He is your helper and your shield."
11512," The Lord remembers us and will bless us.
    He will bless the people of Israel
    and bless the priests, the descendants of Aaron."
11513," He will bless those who fear the Lord,
    both great and lowly."
11514," May the Lord richly bless
    both you and your children."
11515," May you be blessed by the Lord,
    who made heaven and earth."
11516," The heavens belong to the Lord,
    but he has given the earth to all humanity."
11517," The dead cannot sing praises to the Lord,
    for they have gone into the silence of the grave."
11518," But we can praise the Lord
    both now and forever!
Praise the Lord!"
11601," I love the Lord because he hears my voice
    and my prayer for mercy."
11602," Because he bends down to listen,
    I will pray as long as I have breath!"
11603," Death wrapped its ropes around me;
    the terrors of the grave overtook me.
    I saw only trouble and sorrow."
11604," Then I called on the name of the Lord:
    Please, Lord, save me!"
11605," How kind the Lord is! How good he is!
    So merciful, this God of ours!"
11606," The Lord protects those of childlike faith;
    I was facing death, and he saved me."
11607," Let my soul be at rest again,
    for the Lord has been good to me."
11608," He has saved me from death,
    my eyes from tears,
    my feet from stumbling."
11609," And so I walk in the Lords presence
    as I live here on earth!"
11610," I believed in you, so I said,
    I am deeply troubled, Lord."
11611," In my anxiety I cried out to you,
    These people are all liars!"
11612," What can I offer the Lord
    for all he has done for me?"
11613," I will lift up the cup of salvation
    and praise the Lords name for saving me."
11614," I will keep my promises to the Lord
    in the presence of all his people."
11615," The Lord cares deeply
    when his loved ones die."
11616," O Lord, I am your servant;
    yes, I am your servant, born into your household;
    you have freed me from my chains."
11617," I will offer you a sacrifice of thanksgiving
    and call on the name of the Lord."
11618," I will fulfill my vows to the Lord
    in the presence of all his people"
11619," in the house of the Lord
    in the heart of Jerusalem.
Praise the Lord!"
11701," Praise the Lord, all you nations.
    Praise him, all you people of the earth."
11702," For his unfailing love for us is powerful;
    the Lords faithfulness endures forever.

    His faithful love endures forever."
11804," Let all who fear the Lord repeat:
    His faithful love endures forever."
11805," In my distress I prayed to the Lord,
    and the Lord answered me and set me free."
11806," The Lord is for me, so I will have no fear.
    What can mere people do to me?"
11807," Yes, the Lord is for me; he will help me.
    I will look in triumph at those who hate me."
11808," It is better to take refuge in the Lord
    than to trust in people."
11809," It is better to take refuge in the Lord
    than to trust in princes."
11810," Though hostile nations surrounded me,
    I destroyed them all with the authority of the Lord."
11811," Yes, they surrounded and attacked me,
    but I destroyed them all with the authority of the Lord."
11812," They swarmed around me like bees;
    they blazed against me like a crackling fire.
    But I destroyed them all with the authority of the Lord."
11813," My enemies did their best to kill me,
    but the Lord rescued me."
11814," The Lord is my strength and my song;
    he has given me victory."
11815," Songs of joy and victory are sung in the camp of the godly.
    The strong right arm of the Lord has done glorious things!"
11816," The strong right arm of the Lord is raised in triumph.
    The strong right arm of the Lord has done glorious things!"

    to tell what the Lord has done."
11818," The Lord has punished me severely,
    but he did not let me die."
11819," Open for me the gates where the righteous enter,
    and I will go in and thank the Lord."
11820," These gates lead to the presence of the Lord,
    and the godly enter there."
11821," I thank you for answering my prayer
    and giving me victory!"
11822," The stone that the builders rejected
    has now become the cornerstone."
11823," This is the Lords doing,
    and it is wonderful to see."
11824," This is the day the Lord has made.
    We will rejoice and be glad in it."
11825," Please, Lord, please save us.
    Please, Lord, please give us success."
11826," Bless the one who comes in the name of the Lord.
    We bless you from the house of the Lord."
11827," The Lord is God, shining upon us.
    Take the sacrifice and bind it with cords on the altar."

    His faithful love endures forever."
11901," Joyful are people of integrity,
    who follow the instructions of the Lord."
11902," Joyful are those who obey his laws
    and search for him with all their hearts."
11903," They do not compromise with evil,
    and they walk only in his paths."
11904," You have charged us
    to keep your commandments carefully."
11905," Oh, that my actions would consistently
    reflect your decrees!"
11906," Then I will not be ashamed
    when I compare my life with your commands."
11907," As I learn your righteous regulations,
    I will thank you by living as I should!"
11908," I will obey your decrees.
    Please dont give up on me!"
11909," How can a young person stay pure?
    By obeying your word."
11910," I have tried hard to find you
    dont let me wander from your commands."
11911," I have hidden your word in my heart,
    that I might not sin against you."
11912," I praise you, O Lord;
    teach me your decrees."
11913," I have recited aloud
    all the regulations you have given us."
11914," I have rejoiced in your laws
    as much as in riches."
11915," I will study your commandments
    and reflect on your ways."

    and not forget your word."

    with a desire for your regulations."

    for I have obeyed your laws."
11923," Even princes sit and speak against me,
    but I will meditate on your decrees."
11924," Your laws please me;
    they give me wise advice."
11925," I lie in the dust;
    revive me by your word."
11926," I told you my plans, and you answered.
    Now teach me your decrees."

    and I will meditate on your wonderful deeds."

    rather than a love for money!"

    and give me life through your word."

    made to those who fear you."

    to obey your commands."

    but I am firmly anchored to your instructions."
11962," I rise at midnight to thank you
    for your just regulations."
11963," I am a friend to anyone who fears you
    anyone who obeys your commandments."
11964," O Lord, your unfailing love fills the earth;
    teach me your decrees."
11965," You have done many good things for me, Lord,
    just as you promised."
11966," I believe in your commands;
    now teach me good judgment and knowledge."

    but now I closely follow your word."

    teach me your decrees."

    but in truth I obey your commandments with all my heart."

    but I delight in your instructions."

    for it taught me to pay attention to your decrees."
11972," Your instructions are more valuable to me
    than millions in gold and silver."
11973," You made me; you created me.
    Now give me the sense to follow your commands."
11974," May all who fear you find in me a cause for joy,
    for I have put my hope in your word."
11975," I know, O Lord, that your regulations are fair;
    you disciplined me because I needed it."
11976," Now let your unfailing love comfort me,
    just as you promised me, your servant."
11977," Surround me with your tender mercies so I may live,
    for your instructions are my delight."
11978," Bring disgrace upon the arrogant people who lied about me;
    meanwhile, I will concentrate on your commandments."
11979," Let me be united with all who fear you,
    with those who know your laws."
11980," May I be blameless in keeping your decrees;
    then I will never be ashamed."
11981," I am worn out waiting for your rescue,
    but I have put my hope in your word."
11982," My eyes are straining to see your promises come true.
    When will you comfort me?"
11983," I am shriveled like a wineskin in the smoke,
    but I have not forgotten to obey your decrees."
11984," How long must I wait?
    When will you punish those who persecute me?"
11985," These arrogant people who hate your instructions
    have dug deep pits to trap me."
11986," All your commands are trustworthy.
    Protect me from those who hunt me down without cause."
11987," They almost finished me off,
    but I refused to abandon your commandments."

11913018," I am even wiser than my elders,

12001," I took my troubles to the Lord;
    I cried out to him, and he answered my prayer."
12002," Rescue me, O Lord, from liars
    and from all deceitful people."
12003," O deceptive tongue, what will God do to you?
    How will he increase your punishment?"
12004," You will be pierced with sharp arrows
    and burned with glowing coals."
12005," How I suffer in faroff Meshech.
    It pains me to live in distant Kedar."
12006," I am tired of living
    among people who hate peace."
12007," I search for peace;
    but when I speak of peace, they want war!"
12101," I look up to the mountains
    does my help come from there?"
12102," My help comes from the Lord,
    who made heaven and earth!"
12103," He will not let you stumble;
    the one who watches over you will not slumber."
12104," Indeed, he who watches over Israel
    never slumbers or sleeps."
12105," The Lord himself watches over you!
    The Lord stands beside you as your protective shade."
12106," The sun will not harm you by day,
    nor the moon at night."
12107," The Lord keeps you from all harm
    and watches over your life."
12108," The Lord keeps watch over you as you come and go,
    both now and forever."
12201," I was glad when they said to me,
    Let us go to the house of the Lord."
12202," And now here we are,
    standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem."
12203," Jerusalem is a wellbuilt city;
    its seamless walls cannot be breached."
12204," All the tribes of Israelthe Lords people
    make their pilgrimage here.
They come to give thanks to the name of the Lord,
    as the law requires of Israel."
12205," Here stand the thrones where judgment is given,
    the thrones of the dynasty of David."
12206," Pray for peace in Jerusalem.
    May all who love this city prosper."
12207," O Jerusalem, may there be peace within your walls
    and prosperity in your palaces."
12208," For the sake of my family and friends, I will say,
    May you have peace."
12209," For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,
    I will seek what is best for you, O Jerusalem."
12301," I lift my eyes to you,
    O God, enthroned in heaven."
12302," We keep looking to the Lord our God for his mercy,
    just as servants keep their eyes on their master,
    as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal."
12303," Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy,
    for we have had our fill of contempt."
12304," We have had more than our fill of the scoffing of the proud
    and the contempt of the arrogant."
12401," What if the Lord had not been on our side?
    Let all Israel repeat:"
12402," What if the Lord had not been on our side
    when people attacked us?"
12403," They would have swallowed us alive
    in their burning anger."
12404," The waters would have engulfed us;
    a torrent would have overwhelmed us."
12405," Yes, the raging waters of their fury
    would have overwhelmed our very lives."
12406," Praise the Lord,
    who did not let their teeth tear us apart!"
12407," We escaped like a bird from a hunters trap.
    The trap is broken, and we are free!"
12408," Our help is from the Lord,
    who made heaven and earth."
12501," Those who trust in the Lord are as secure as Mount Zion;
    they will not be defeated but will endure forever."
12502," Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem,
    so the Lord surrounds his people, both now and forever."
12503," The wicked will not rule the land of the godly,
    for then the godly might be tempted to do wrong."
12504," O Lord, do good to those who are good,
    whose hearts are in tune with you."
12505," But banish those who turn to crooked ways, O Lord.
    Take them away with those who do evil.
May Israel have peace!"
12601," When the Lord brought back his exiles to Jerusalem,
    it was like a dream!"
12602," We were filled with laughter,
    and we sang for joy.
And the other nations said,
    What amazing things the Lord has done for them."
12603," Yes, the Lord has done amazing things for us!
    What joy!"
12604," Restore our fortunes, Lord,
    as streams renew the desert."
12605," Those who plant in tears
    will harvest with shouts of joy."
12606," They weep as they go to plant their seed,
    but they sing as they return with the harvest."
12701," Unless the Lord builds a house,
    the work of the builders is wasted.
Unless the Lord protects a city,
    guarding it with sentries will do no good."
12702," It is useless for you to work so hard
    from early morning until late at night,
anxiously working for food to eat;
    for God gives rest to his loved ones."
12703," Children are a gift from the Lord;
    they are a reward from him."
12704," Children born to a young man
    are like arrows in a warriors hands."
12705," How joyful is the man whose quiver is full of them!
    He will not be put to shame when he confronts his accusers at the city gates."
12801," How joyful are those who fear the Lord
    all who follow his ways!"
12802," You will enjoy the fruit of your labor.
    How joyful and prosperous you will be!"
12803," Your wife will be like a fruitful grapevine,
    flourishing within your home.
Your children will be like vigorous young olive trees
    as they sit around your table."
12804," That is the Lords blessing
    for those who fear him."
12805," May the Lord continually bless you from Zion.
    May you see Jerusalem prosper as long as you live."
12806," May you live to enjoy your grandchildren.
    May Israel have peace!"
12901," From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me.
    Let all Israel repeat this:"
12902," From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me,
    but they have never defeated me."
12903," My back is covered with cuts,
    as if a farmer had plowed long furrows."
12904," But the Lord is good;
    he has cut me free from the ropes of the ungodly."
12905," May all who hate Jerusalem
    be turned back in shameful defeat."
12906," May they be as useless as grass on a rooftop,
    turning yellow when only half grown,"
12907," ignored by the harvester,
    despised by the binder."
12908," And may those who pass by
    refuse to give them this blessing:
The Lord bless you;
    we bless you in the Lords name."
13001," From the depths of despair, O Lord,
    I call for your help."
13002," Hear my cry, O Lord.
    Pay attention to my prayer."
13003," Lord, if you kept a record of our sins,
    who, O Lord, could ever survive?"
13004," But you offer forgiveness,
    that we might learn to fear you."
13005," I am counting on the Lord;
    yes, I am counting on him.
    I have put my hope in his word."
13006," I long for the Lord
    more than sentries long for the dawn,
    yes, more than sentries long for the dawn."
13007," O Israel, hope in the Lord;
    for with the Lord there is unfailing love.
    His redemption overflows."
13008," He himself will redeem Israel
    from every kind of sin."
13101," Lord, my heart is not proud;
    my eyes are not haughty.
I dont concern myself with matters too great
    or too awesome for me to grasp."
13102," Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself,
    like a weaned child who no longer cries for its mothers milk.
    Yes, like a weaned child is my soul within me."
13103," O Israel, put your hope in the Lord
    now and always."
13201," Lord, remember David
    and all that he suffered."
13202," He made a solemn promise to the Lord.
    He vowed to the Mighty One of Israel,"
13203," I will not go home;
    I will not let myself rest."
13204," I will not let my eyes sleep
    nor close my eyelids in slumber"
13205," until I find a place to build a house for the Lord,
    a sanctuary for the Mighty One of Israel."
13206," We heard that the Ark was in Ephrathah;
    then we found it in the distant countryside of Jaar."
13207," Let us go to the sanctuary of the Lord;
    let us worship at the footstool of his throne."
13208," Arise, O Lord, and enter your resting place,
    along with the Ark, the symbol of your power."
13209," May your priests be clothed in godliness;
    may your loyal servants sing for joy."
13210," For the sake of your servant David,
    do not reject the king you have anointed."
13211," The Lord swore an oath to David
    with a promise he will never take back:
I will place one of your descendants
    on your throne."
13212," If your descendants obey the terms of my covenant
    and the laws that I teach them,
then your royal line
    will continue forever and ever."
13213," For the Lord has chosen Jerusalem;
    he has desired it for his home."
13214," This is my resting place forever, he said.
    I will live here, for this is the home I desired."
13215," I will bless this city and make it prosperous;
    I will satisfy its poor with food."
13216," I will clothe its priests with godliness;
    its faithful servants will sing for joy."
13217," Here I will increase the power of David;
    my anointed one will be a light for my people."
13218," I will clothe his enemies with shame,
    but he will be a glorious king."
13301," How wonderful and pleasant it is
    when brothers live together in harmony!"
13302," For harmony is as precious as the anointing oil
    that was poured over Aarons head,
    that ran down his beard
    and onto the border of his robe."
13303," Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon
    that falls on the mountains of Zion.
And there the Lord has pronounced his blessing,
    even life everlasting."
13401," Oh, praise the Lord, all you servants of the Lord,
    you who serve at night in the house of the Lord."
13402," Lift your hands toward the sanctuary,
    and praise the Lord."
13403," May the Lord, who made heaven and earth,
    bless you from Jerusalem."
13501," Praise the Lord!
Praise the name of the Lord!
    Praise him, you who serve the Lord,"
13502," you who serve in the house of the Lord,
    in the courts of the house of our God."
13503," Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good;
    celebrate his lovely name with music."
13504," For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself,
    Israel for his own special treasure."
13505," I know the greatness of the Lord
    that our Lord is greater than any other god."
13506," The Lord does whatever pleases him
    throughout all heaven and earth,
    and on the seas and in their depths."
13507," He causes the clouds to rise over the whole earth.
    He sends the lightning with the rain
    and releases the wind from his storehouses."
13508," He destroyed the firstborn in each Egyptian home,
    both people and animals."
13509," He performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt
    against Pharaoh and all his people."
13510," He struck down great nations
    and slaughtered mighty kings"
13511," Sihon king of the Amorites,
    Og king of Bashan,
    and all the kings of Canaan."
13512," He gave their land as an inheritance,
    a special possession to his people Israel."
13513," Your name, O Lord, endures forever;
    your fame, O Lord, is known to every generation."
13514," For the Lord will give justice to his people
    and have compassion on his servants."
13515," The idols of the nations are merely things of silver and gold,
    shaped by human hands."
13516," They have mouths but cannot speak,
    and eyes but cannot see."
13517," They have ears but cannot hear,
    and mouths but cannot breathe."
13518," And those who make idols are just like them,
    as are all who trust in them."
13519," O Israel, praise the Lord!
    O priestsdescendants of Aaronpraise the Lord!"
13520," O Levites, praise the Lord!
    All you who fear the Lord, praise the Lord!"
13521," The Lord be praised from Zion,
    for he lives here in Jerusalem.
Praise the Lord!"
13601," Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good!
His faithful love endures forever."
13602," Give thanks to the God of gods.
His faithful love endures forever."
13603," Give thanks to the Lord of lords.
His faithful love endures forever."
13604," Give thanks to him who alone does mighty miracles.
His faithful love endures forever."
13605," Give thanks to him who made the heavens so skillfully.
His faithful love endures forever."
13606," Give thanks to him who placed the earth among the waters.
His faithful love endures forever."
13607," Give thanks to him who made the heavenly lights
His faithful love endures forever."
13608," the sun to rule the day,
His faithful love endures forever."
13609," and the moon and stars to rule the night.
His faithful love endures forever."
13610," Give thanks to him who killed the firstborn of Egypt.
His faithful love endures forever."
13611," He brought Israel out of Egypt.
His faithful love endures forever."
13612," He acted with a strong hand and powerful arm.
His faithful love endures forever."
13613," Give thanks to him who parted the Red Sea.
His faithful love endures forever."
13614," He led Israel safely through,
His faithful love endures forever."
13615," but he hurled Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea.
His faithful love endures forever."
13616," Give thanks to him who led his people through the wilderness.
His faithful love endures forever."
13617," Give thanks to him who struck down mighty kings.
His faithful love endures forever."
13618," He killed powerful kings
His faithful love endures forever."
13619," Sihon king of the Amorites,
His faithful love endures forever."
13620," and Og king of Bashan.
His faithful love endures forever."
13621," God gave the land of these kings as an inheritance
His faithful love endures forever."
13622," a special possession to his servant Israel.
His faithful love endures forever."
13623," He remembered us in our weakness.
His faithful love endures forever."
13624," He saved us from our enemies.
His faithful love endures forever."
13625," He gives food to every living thing.
His faithful love endures forever."
13626," Give thanks to the God of heaven.
His faithful love endures forever."
13701," Beside the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept
    as we thought of Jerusalem."
13702," We put away our harps,
    hanging them on the branches of poplar trees."
13703," For our captors demanded a song from us.
    Our tormentors insisted on a joyful hymn:
    Sing us one of those songs of Jerusalem!"
13704," But how can we sing the songs of the Lord
    while in a pagan land?"
13705," If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
    let my right hand forget how to play the harp."
13706," May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth
    if I fail to remember you,
    if I dont make Jerusalem my greatest joy."
13707," O Lord, remember what the Edomites did
    on the day the armies of Babylon captured Jerusalem.
Destroy it! they yelled.
    Level it to the ground!"
13708," O Babylon, you will be destroyed.
    Happy is the one who pays you back
    for what you have done to us."
13709," Happy is the one who takes your babies
    and smashes them against the rocks!"
13801," I give you thanks, O Lord, with all my heart;
    I will sing your praises before the gods."
13802," I bow before your holy Temple as I worship.
    I praise your name for your unfailing love and faithfulness;
for your promises are backed
    by all the honor of your name."
13803," As soon as I pray, you answer me;
    you encourage me by giving me strength."
13804," Every king in all the earth will thank you, Lord,
    for all of them will hear your words."
13805," Yes, they will sing about the Lords ways,
    for the glory of the Lord is very great."
13806," Though the Lord is great, he cares for the humble,
    but he keeps his distance from the proud."
13807," Though I am surrounded by troubles,
    you will protect me from the anger of my enemies.
You reach out your hand,
    and the power of your right hand saves me."
13808," The Lord will work out his plans for my life
    for your faithful love, O Lord, endures forever.
    Dont abandon me, for you made me."
13901," O Lord, you have examined my heart
    and know everything about me."
13902," You know when I sit down or stand up.
    You know my thoughts even when Im far away."
13903," You see me when I travel
    and when I rest at home.
    You know everything I do."
13904," You know what I am going to say
    even before I say it, Lord."
13905," You go before me and follow me.
    You place your hand of blessing on my head."
13906," Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
    too great for me to understand!"
13907," I can never escape from your Spirit!
    I can never get away from your presence!"
13908," If I go up to heaven, you are there;
    if I go down to the grave, you are there."
13909," If I ride the wings of the morning,
    if I dwell by the farthest oceans,"
13910," even there your hand will guide me,
    and your strength will support me."
13911," I could ask the darkness to hide me
    and the light around me to become night"
13912,"     but even in darkness I cannot hide from you.
To you the night shines as bright as day.
    Darkness and light are the same to you."
13913," You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body
    and knit me together in my mothers womb."
13914," Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!
    Your workmanship is marveloushow well I know it."
13915," You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion,
    as I was woven together in the dark of the womb."
13916," You saw me before I was born.
    Every day of my life was recorded in your book.
Every moment was laid out
    before a single day had passed."
13917," How precious are your thoughts about me, O God.
    They cannot be numbered!"
13918," I cant even count them;
    they outnumber the grains of sand!
And when I wake up,
    you are still with me!"
13919," O God, if only you would destroy the wicked!
    Get out of my life, you murderers!"
13920," They blaspheme you;
    your enemies misuse your name."
13921," O Lord, shouldnt I hate those who hate you?
    Shouldnt I despise those who oppose you?"
13922," Yes, I hate them with total hatred,
    for your enemies are my enemies."
13923," Search me, O God, and know my heart;
    test me and know my anxious thoughts."
13924," Point out anything in me that offends you,
    and lead me along the path of everlasting life."
14001," O Lord, rescue me from evil people.
    Protect me from those who are violent,"
14002," those who plot evil in their hearts
    and stir up trouble all day long."
14003," Their tongues sting like a snake;
    the venom of a viper drips from their lips. Interlude"
14004," O Lord, keep me out of the hands of the wicked.
    Protect me from those who are violent,
    for they are plotting against me."
14005," The proud have set a trap to catch me;
    they have stretched out a net;
    they have placed traps all along the way. Interlude"
14006," I said to the Lord, You are my God!
    Listen, O Lord, to my cries for mercy!"
14007," O Sovereign Lord, the strong one who rescued me,
    you protected me on the day of battle."
14008," Lord, do not let evil people have their way.
    Do not let their evil schemes succeed,
    or they will become proud. Interlude"
14009," Let my enemies be destroyed
    by the very evil they have planned for me."
14010," Let burning coals fall down on their heads.
    Let them be thrown into the fire
    or into watery pits from which they cant escape."
14011," Dont let liars prosper here in our land.
    Cause great disasters to fall on the violent."
14012," But I know the Lord will help those they persecute;
    he will give justice to the poor."
14013," Surely righteous people are praising your name;
    the godly will live in your presence."
14101," O Lord, I am calling to you. Please hurry!
    Listen when I cry to you for help!"
14102," Accept my prayer as incense offered to you,
    and my upraised hands as an evening offering."
14103," Take control of what I say, O Lord,
    and guard my lips."
14104," Dont let me drift toward evil
    or take part in acts of wickedness.
Dont let me share in the delicacies
    of those who do wrong."
14105," Let the godly strike me!
    It will be a kindness!
If they correct me, it is soothing medicine.
    Dont let me refuse it.
But I pray constantly
    against the wicked and their deeds."
14106," When their leaders are thrown down from a cliff,
    the wicked will listen to my words and find them true."
14107," Like rocks brought up by a plow,
    the bones of the wicked will lie scattered without burial."
14108," I look to you for help, O Sovereign Lord.
    You are my refuge; dont let them kill me."
14109," Keep me from the traps they have set for me,
    from the snares of those who do wrong."
14110," Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
    but let me escape."
14201," I cry out to the Lord;
    I plead for the Lords mercy."
14202," I pour out my complaints before him
    and tell him all my troubles."
14203," When I am overwhelmed,
    you alone know the way I should turn.
Wherever I go,
    my enemies have set traps for me."
14204," I look for someone to come and help me,
    but no one gives me a passing thought!
No one will help me;
    no one cares a bit what happens to me."
14205," Then I pray to you, O Lord.
    I say, You are my place of refuge.
    You are all I really want in life."
14206," Hear my cry,
    for I am very low.
Rescue me from my persecutors,
    for they are too strong for me."
14207," Bring me out of prison
    so I can thank you.
The godly will crowd around me,
    for you are good to me."
14301," Hear my prayer, O Lord;
    listen to my plea!
    Answer me because you are faithful and righteous."
14302," Dont put your servant on trial,
    for no one is innocent before you."
14303," My enemy has chased me.
    He has knocked me to the ground
    and forces me to live in darkness like those in the grave."
14304," I am losing all hope;
    I am paralyzed with fear."
14305," I remember the days of old.
    I ponder all your great works
    and think about what you have done."
14306," I lift my hands to you in prayer.
    I thirst for you as parched land thirsts for rain. Interlude"
14307," Come quickly, Lord, and answer me,
    for my depression deepens.
Dont turn away from me,
    or I will die."
14308," Let me hear of your unfailing love each morning,
    for I am trusting you.
Show me where to walk,
    for I give myself to you."
14309," Rescue me from my enemies, Lord;
    I run to you to hide me."
14310," Teach me to do your will,
    for you are my God.
May your gracious Spirit lead me forward
    on a firm footing."
14311," For the glory of your name, O Lord, preserve my life.
    Because of your faithfulness, bring me out of this distress."
14312," In your unfailing love, silence all my enemies
    and destroy all my foes,
    for I am your servant."
14401," Praise the Lord, who is my rock.
    He trains my hands for war
    and gives my fingers skill for battle."
14402," He is my loving ally and my fortress,
    my tower of safety, my rescuer.
He is my shield, and I take refuge in him.
    He makes the nations submit to me."
14403," O Lord, what are human beings that you should notice them,
    mere mortals that you should think about them?"
14404," For they are like a breath of air;
    their days are like a passing shadow."
14405," Open the heavens, Lord, and come down.
    Touch the mountains so they billow smoke."
14406," Hurl your lightning bolts and scatter your enemies!
    Shoot your arrows and confuse them!"
14407," Reach down from heaven and rescue me;
    rescue me from deep waters,
    from the power of my enemies."
14408," Their mouths are full of lies;
    they swear to tell the truth, but they lie instead."
14409," I will sing a new song to you, O God!
    I will sing your praises with a tenstringed harp."
14410," For you grant victory to kings!
    You rescued your servant David from the fatal sword."
14411," Save me!
    Rescue me from the power of my enemies.
Their mouths are full of lies;
    they swear to tell the truth, but they lie instead."
14412," May our sons flourish in their youth
    like wellnurtured plants.
May our daughters be like graceful pillars,
    carved to beautify a palace."
14413," May our barns be filled
    with crops of every kind.
May the flocks in our fields multiply by the thousands,
    even tens of thousands,"
14414,"     and may our oxen be loaded down with produce.
May there be no enemy breaking through our walls,
    no going into captivity,
    no cries of alarm in our town squares."
14415," Yes, joyful are those who live like this!
    Joyful indeed are those whose God is the Lord."
14501," I will exalt you, my God and King,
    and praise your name forever and ever."
14502," I will praise you every day;
    yes, I will praise you forever."
14503," Great is the Lord! He is most worthy of praise!
    No one can measure his greatness."
14504," Let each generation tell its children of your mighty acts;
    let them proclaim your power."
14505," I will meditate on your majestic, glorious splendor
    and your wonderful miracles."
14506," Your aweinspiring deeds will be on every tongue;
    I will proclaim your greatness."
14507," Everyone will share the story of your wonderful goodness;
    they will sing with joy about your righteousness."
14508," The Lord is merciful and compassionate,
    slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love."
14509," The Lord is good to everyone.
    He showers compassion on all his creation."
14510," All of your works will thank you, Lord,
    and your faithful followers will praise you."
14511," They will speak of the glory of your kingdom;
    they will give examples of your power."
14512," They will tell about your mighty deeds
    and about the majesty and glory of your reign."
14513," For your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.
    You rule throughout all generations.
The Lord always keeps his promises;
    he is gracious in all he does."
14514," The Lord helps the fallen
    and lifts those bent beneath their loads."
14515," The eyes of all look to you in hope;
    you give them their food as they need it."
14516," When you open your hand,
    you satisfy the hunger and thirst of every living thing."
14517," The Lord is righteous in everything he does;
    he is filled with kindness."
14518," The Lord is close to all who call on him,
    yes, to all who call on him in truth."
14519," He grants the desires of those who fear him;
    he hears their cries for help and rescues them."
14520," The Lord protects all those who love him,
    but he destroys the wicked."
14521," I will praise the Lord,
    and may everyone on earth bless his holy name
    forever and ever."
14601," Praise the Lord!
Let all that I am praise the Lord."
14602,"     I will praise the Lord as long as I live.
    I will sing praises to my God with my dying breath."
14603," Dont put your confidence in powerful people;
    there is no help for you there."
14604," When they breathe their last, they return to the earth,
    and all their plans die with them."
14605," But joyful are those who have the God of Israel as their helper,
    whose hope is in the Lord their God."
14606," He made heaven and earth,
    the sea, and everything in them.
    He keeps every promise forever."
14607," He gives justice to the oppressed
    and food to the hungry.
The Lord frees the prisoners."
14608,"     The Lord opens the eyes of the blind.
The Lord lifts up those who are weighed down.
    The Lord loves the godly."
14609," The Lord protects the foreigners among us.
    He cares for the orphans and widows,
    but he frustrates the plans of the wicked."
14610," The Lord will reign forever.
    He will be your God, O Jerusalem, throughout the generations.
Praise the Lord!"
14701," Praise the Lord!
How good to sing praises to our God!
    How delightful and how fitting!"
14702," The Lord is rebuilding Jerusalem
    and bringing the exiles back to Israel."
14703," He heals the brokenhearted
    and bandages their wounds."
14704," He counts the stars
    and calls them all by name."
14705," How great is our Lord! His power is absolute!
    His understanding is beyond comprehension!"
14706," The Lord supports the humble,
    but he brings the wicked down into the dust."
14707," Sing out your thanks to the Lord;
    sing praises to our God with a harp."
14708," He covers the heavens with clouds,
    provides rain for the earth,
    and makes the grass grow in mountain pastures."
14709," He gives food to the wild animals
    and feeds the young ravens when they cry."
14710," He takes no pleasure in the strength of a horse
    or in human might."
14711," No, the Lords delight is in those who fear him,
    those who put their hope in his unfailing love."
14712," Glorify the Lord, O Jerusalem!
    Praise your God, O Zion!"
14713," For he has strengthened the bars of your gates
    and blessed your children within your walls."
14714," He sends peace across your nation
    and satisfies your hunger with the finest wheat."
14715," He sends his orders to the world
    how swiftly his word flies!"
14716," He sends the snow like white wool;
    he scatters frost upon the ground like ashes."
14717," He hurls the hail like stones.
    Who can stand against his freezing cold?"
14718," Then, at his command, it all melts.
    He sends his winds, and the ice thaws."
14719," He has revealed his words to Jacob,
    his decrees and regulations to Israel."
14720," He has not done this for any other nation;
    they do not know his regulations.
Praise the Lord!"
14801," Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord from the heavens!
    Praise him from the skies!"
14802," Praise him, all his angels!
    Praise him, all the armies of heaven!"
14803," Praise him, sun and moon!
    Praise him, all you twinkling stars!"
14804," Praise him, skies above!
    Praise him, vapors high above the clouds!"
14805," Let every created thing give praise to the Lord,
    for he issued his command, and they came into being."
14806," He set them in place forever and ever.
    His decree will never be revoked."
14807," Praise the Lord from the earth,
    you creatures of the ocean depths,"
14808," fire and hail, snow and clouds,
    wind and weather that obey him,"
14809," mountains and all hills,
    fruit trees and all cedars,"
14810," wild animals and all livestock,
    small scurrying animals and birds,"
14811," kings of the earth and all people,
    rulers and judges of the earth,"
14812," young men and young women,
    old men and children."
14813," Let them all praise the name of the Lord.
    For his name is very great;
    his glory towers over the earth and heaven!"
14814," He has made his people strong,
    honoring his faithful ones
    the people of Israel who are close to him.
Praise the Lord!"
14901," Praise the Lord!
Sing to the Lord a new song.
    Sing his praises in the assembly of the faithful."
14902," O Israel, rejoice in your Maker.
    O people of Jerusalem, exult in your King."
14903," Praise his name with dancing,
    accompanied by tambourine and harp."
14904," For the Lord delights in his people;
    he crowns the humble with victory."
14905," Let the faithful rejoice that he honors them.
    Let them sing for joy as they lie on their beds."
14906," Let the praises of God be in their mouths,
    and a sharp sword in their hands"
14907," to execute vengeance on the nations
    and punishment on the peoples,"
14908," to bind their kings with shackles
    and their leaders with iron chains,"
14909," to execute the judgment written against them.
    This is the glorious privilege of his faithful ones.
Praise the Lord!"
15001," Praise the Lord!
Praise God in his sanctuary;
    praise him in his mighty heaven!"
15002," Praise him for his mighty works;
    praise his unequaled greatness!"
15003," Praise him with a blast of the rams horn;
    praise him with the lyre and harp!"
15004," Praise him with the tambourine and dancing;
    praise him with strings and flutes!"
15005," Praise him with a clash of cymbals;
    praise him with loud clanging cymbals."
15006," Let everything that breathes sing praises to the Lord!
Praise the Lord!"
