# LLM Prompt Recovery
<h2>Abstract</h2>
AI, and GenAI particularly in recent years, is often met with significant opposition due to our inability to understand the decision-making that goes on under the hood of the respective model. Because of this, researchers and industry professionals are racing to figure out ways to dig into the infrastructure of LLMs and transformer models in general to incorporate reasoning traces that could potentially shed light on how we can unravel the black box inner-workings of AI. This repository contains the efforts of the team KAD Solutions in the LLM Prompt Recovery Machine Learning Competition hosted by Kaggle in partnership with Google to exhibit the release of their new family of lightweight LLMs entitled Gemma between February 27th and April 16th, 2024. Overall, our team "KAD Solutions" placed in the top 40th percetile of participants with a highest-recorded testing simiarity score of 0.62. <br>
